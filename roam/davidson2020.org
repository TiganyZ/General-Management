  - bcc Fe lattice represented by discrete tetrahedral interstitial
    sites.
  - Vacancy represented by trap sites which correspond to the static
    equilibrium locations of H.
  - Vibrational contriution to the free energy from the atomic nuclei
    has been included with the quasiharmonic approximation.
  - _Full free energy contribution_ can only be accounted for with
    off-lattice models. Such as OLKMC.
** Weak binding of H to the vacancy suggests that H moves smoothly in a continuous landscape of potential

   - This implies that the total entropy in the bulk will be greater
     than the configurational entropy which is captured by the lattice
     model.
