** Questions :QUESTIONS:
** Summary :SUMMARY:
   Focuses on _surface segregation_, at thermodynamical equilibrium.
   Two competitive interactions:
   - between surface and bulk interactions (surface energy vs bulk
     alloying interactions)
   - between these chemical forces and the atomic size-mismatch.

     Derived from [[file:2021-03-03--11-13-35--tight_binding.org][tight-binding]]. We can get realistic energetic models
     such as monte-carlo simulations etc5D.
** Notes
