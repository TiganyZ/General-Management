  \[ \dot{\epsilon} = \rho b \nu = \rho b a \Gamma \]

  - $\dot{\epsilon}$ is the strain rate
  - $\rho$ is the dislocation density
  - $b$ is the burgers vector
  - $v$ is the dislocation velocity

  - The second equality is for use of [[file:2021-03-04--14-44-41--transition_state_theory.org][transition-state theory]], using
    the quantum regime.

  - $\Gamma$ is the transition rate over the kink-pair barrier
  - $a$ I assume is the lattice vector.
