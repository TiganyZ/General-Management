#+title: Portevin–Le Chatelier effect

The Portevin–Le Chatelier effect (PLC) describes a *serrated*
stress–strain curve or jerky flow, which some materials exhibit as
they undergo plastic deformation, specifically /inhomogeneous
deformation/.

This effect has been long associated with [[file:20210105175322-strain_ageing.org][dynamic strain-aging]] or the competition between diffusing solutes pinning dislocations and dislocations breaking free of this stoppage.
