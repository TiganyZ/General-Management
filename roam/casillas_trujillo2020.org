  :END:

  - Ferromagnetism actually only relevent for the 0\deg K iron.
  - Changes in the magnetic state can lead to modifications in the
    structure of the core and affect dislocation mobility.
  - *Paramagnetic* state of the 1/2<111> screw core, using
    _noncollinear disordered local moment approximation_
  - By averaging the energy of several disordered magnetic
    configurations, we obtain an energy diffreence between the easy
    and hard-core configurations.
  - *Lower energy difference* between the cores actually found.
  - Temperature-dependent dislocation-solute interactions actually
    might be affected.
