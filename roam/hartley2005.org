** Notes
   - This relates how the cores of dislocations can by represented by
     the [[file:2021-03-01--13-53-52--nye_tensor.org][Nye Tensor]] components.
   - This describes a distribution of infinitesimal dislocations.

   - A dislocation characterised by its burgers vector $ \mathbf{b}$,
     can be described by a distribution of infinitesimal dislocations
     $d\mathbf{b}$.

   - The Nye tensor $\mathbf{\alpha}$ describes the distribution of
     infinitesimal dislocations by

     \[ \text{d}\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{\alpha} \cdot n \text{d} A  \]

   - Integrating over a bounded by a closed circuit, one can recover
     the burger's vector for a dislocation.

     \[ \mathbf{b} = \int_A (\mathbf{\alpha}\cdot \mathbf{n})
     \text{d}}A  \]

   - By definition of the burger's circuit, we have, in the dislocated
     lattice, which has lattice vectors $\text{d}\mathbf{x}'$,

     \[  0 = \sum_{C'} \text{d}\mathbf{x}' \]

   - So in the perfect lattice we have

     \[ \mathbf{b} = - \sum_{C} \text{d}\mathbf{x}, \]

     where

     \[ \text{d}\mathbf{x} = \text{d}\mathbf{x}' \mathbf{G} \]

   - Where $\mathbf{G}$ is the lattice correspondence tensor, which is
     the Eulerian deformation gradient.
   - This is the /transpose/ of the Bilby tensor $\mathbf{E}$
     
     Therefore we have

     \[ \mathbf{b} = - \int_A (\nabla \times \mathbf{G})
     \text{d}}A  \]

     so

     \[ \mathbf{\alpha} = - (\nabla \times \mathbf{G}) \]
