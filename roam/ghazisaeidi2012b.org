   - Nye tensor for each of these are located around the centre of the
     dislocation splitting.
   - Just like with the stress tensor multiplied by a normal vector
     defining the force in that direction, we can have the burger's
     vector in a certain direction defined by the multiplication of
     the stress tensor by the normal direction to the burger's
     circuit.
