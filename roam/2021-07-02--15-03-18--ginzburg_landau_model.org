The Ginzburg-Landau model is generally a model used to describe
superconductivity. Where they think of it as a second-order phase
transition.

Essentially it states that the free energy should have a term akin to
a quantum-mechanical wavefunction, where there is a complex field
$\psi(r)$, where $|\psi(r)|^2$ is a measure of the density.


In the semi-empirical model of [[file:dudarev2005.org][Dudarev2005: A `magnetic' interatomic
potential for molecular dynamics simulations]]
they have a term to describe the magnetic phase transition as (where
$\zeta$ is an order parameter?)

\[ E_{\text{tot}}(N,\zeta) - E_{\text{tot}}(N,0)  = \alpha\zeta^2 + \beta\zeta^4 \]
