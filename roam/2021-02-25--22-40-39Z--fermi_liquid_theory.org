#+TITLE: Fermi Liquid Theory
* Notes
  - We can treat the full Hamiltonian
    \[ \hat{H} = \sum_i -\nabla^{2}_i / 2m + \sum_i V(\mathbf{R}_i)  +
    \sum_{i<j} V_{\text{int}}(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j)  \]

  - We can apply the [[file:2021-02-25--22-45-30--hartree_fock_approximation.org][Hartree-Fock Approximation]] such that we can find
    the ground state.

  - /Fermi liquid theory is to describe the excited states/
  - Assume that the low energy states can by written as _combinations
    of quasiparticles_.
  - N degrees of freedom â†’ 2^N states (occupied/not)
  - Put electrons into orbital with ground state.
  - Each single orbital excitation is a quasiparticle
  - Can have /interactions between the quasiparticles which are the
    second order + terms/

    \[ E_{\text{excited state}} = \sum_{\alpha} \varepsilon_{\alpha}
    n_{\alpha} + \sum_{\alpha,\beta} F_{\alpha,\beta} n_{\alpha}
    n_{\beta} + \cdots  \], where $n_{\alpha} = 0,1$
  - Make assumption that all the excited states can be written in only
    *polynomial number of variables*.
  - N, N^2 for the first and second terms in equation.

** Adding/removing from fermi sphere
   - Can create quasiparticle outside of fermi sphere $\varepsilon_p >
     0$
   - Can make hole quasiparticle inside fermi sphere
     - This makes excitation energy $-\varepsilon_p > 0$ as the
       $\varepsilon_p$ is /negative/.
   - There are *zero energy excitations of holes/electrons at fermi
     wavevector*.
   - E_excite |____\pf/___> p
   - $E_{\text{excite}} =  | \varepsilon_p |$
   - *Adding interactions makes everything "quasi", so then still
     have same behaviour*
   - All e lose energy when being scattered say closer to fermi
     surface.
   - Imagine interaction is with hole scattered out past fermi
     surface (e -> scattered e + hole + e from hole)
   - As energy conserved (sum of hole + hole generated e + scattered
     e)
   - As we have more things in products, then phase space gets
     smaller and smaller and gets closer to fermi surface.
   - Electron-hole pairs are quasi particles.
   - Live forever the closer we get to the fermi surface, as decay
     time with energy becomes longer.

  - This describes the excited states of a system in terms of
    quasiparticles.
