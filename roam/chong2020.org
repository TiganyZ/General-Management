    - With small amounts of oxygen in Ti there is [[file:2021-03-15--09-54-55--solute_strengthening.org][Solute Strengthening]] and
    _decreased ductility_.
    - This motivates high-cost purification of titanium to avoid
      "oxygen poisoning".
    - Increase slip planarity of Ti-O alloys is _caused by an
      interstitial shuffling mechanism_, which is sensitive to
      temperature, strain rate and oxygen content.
    - This leads to an _alteration of twinning behaviour_.


    - 0.2 atomic % increase in O causes a several-fold increase in
      yield stress, but an even larger decrease in ductility and
      toughness.
    - "Wavy-to-planar" transition occurs with increasing oxygen content
    - [[file:2021-03-15--10-08-33--planar_slip_in_ti.org][Planar slip in Ti]] has [[file:20210105175521-dislocations.org][dislocation]] structure more localised to "a region
      of confined planes", which impairs fracture toughness and strain hardening.
    - Wavy slip is characterised by a more evenly distributed
      "multidirectional" dislocation configurations.

    - Wavy slip seen in Ti-Al where transitiy is as a consequence of the
      chemical short range ordering of Al atoms. The dislocations cause
      a distruption of SRO (as Al is substitutional) and so dislocation
      motion is on a softened glide plane.

    - Hypothesised that there is a formation of [[file:2021-03-15--10-14-20--short_range_ordering.org][Short Range Ordering]] in
      Ti-O alloys, which could be responsible for the propensity of
      planar dislocation slip at higher oxygen concentrations, however,
      the much lower concentration of solute atoms in Ti-O alloys,
      compared with Ti-Al alloys casts doubt as to whether these
      phenomena have the same mechanistic origin.

    - [11-24] twinning is detrimental.

    - Atomistic origin can be attributed to transitions in both
      dislocation behaviour and twinning activity.

*** Results of Tensile Tests

     - Three model Ti alloys:
       - pure Ti (0.05 wt% / 0.15 at% O)
       - Ti-0.1O (0.10 wt% / 0.31 at% O)
       - Ti-0.3O (0.30 wt% / 0.88 at% O)
     - Assessed at 500K, 300K, 100K via uniaxial tensile tests with
       strain rate of 10^(-3)s^{-1}.
     - As mentioned before oxygen really causes problems, especially
       with oxygen content at low temperatures.
     - Strain hardening is the plot of true stress against true strain
       = $\epsilon_t = \ln L/L_0$.
     - Strain hardening ability decreased with increasing oxygen
       content at room temperature.
     - At low temperatures, pure Ti and Ti-0.1O have almost identical
       strain hardening curves, but Ti-0.3O is bad, as before.
     - _This suggests a propensity of [[file:2021-03-15--10-57-17--deformation_twinning.org][deformation twinning]] at lower
       temperatures with low oxygen content_
     - Substantial transition in deformation mechanisms of Ti-0.3O
       alloy compared to the rest.
     - Fractography corroborates results.
     - Brittle intergranular mode shown by Ti-0.3O compared to
       intragranular ductile fracture of pure Ti/Ti-0.1O.

*** Wavy-to-planar dislocations

     - Morphology of dislocation structures can be seen as either wavy
       slip or not
     - Figure 2A shows gray/blue points which represent wavy
       slip-dominant and planar slip dominant.

     =How did they categorise wavy vs planar slip?=
     - Wavy slip has a more "messy" structure compared to the planar
       slip.
     - For planar slip, necessary to have low deformation temperature
       and large strain rate at low oxygen content.
     - $\matthbf{g}\cdot\mathbf{b}$ analysis showed mot dislocations
       were $\langle a \rangle$ type, but likely there are $\langle c+a
       \rangle$ around grain boundaries especiallin in specimens with
       higher oxygen content and lower deformation temperature where
       large flow stresses were found.

    - Propose novel interstitial shuffling mechanism to account for the
      temperature and strain rate dependences of the wavy-to-planar
      slip transition in Ti-O alloys.
    - ISM model, there is competition between two processes involving
      the motion of oxygen atoms between different interstitial sites:
      _either octahedral or hexahedral_.
