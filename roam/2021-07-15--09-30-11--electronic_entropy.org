  Electronic entropy is the entropy associated with
  electrons. Generally it can be obtained from the dependence on the
  [[file:2021-07-15--09-31-47--fermi_dirac_distribution.org][Fermi-dirac
  distribution]], from which we can use the standard formulas and
  integrate over the density of states, as was seen in
  [[file:wolverton1995.org][Wolverton1995: First-principles theory of
  short-range order, electronic excitations, and spin polarization in
  Ni-V and Pd-V alloys]].
