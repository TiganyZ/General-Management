   - Helmholtz Free Energy:
     * The energy at constant _temperature_ and _pressure_.
     * The capacity to do mechanical plus non-mechanical work
     * Equation: \[ F = U - TS \]

     * Related to the [[file:2021-03-05--12-04-48--internal_energy.org][Internal Energy]] by the subtraction of th
       entropic term.

     * $\Delta F$ is the total work done on the system.
     * Natural variables: $\{ T, V, \{N_{i}\} \}$
