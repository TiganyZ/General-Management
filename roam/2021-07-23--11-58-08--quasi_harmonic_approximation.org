This is a phonon based model where one can introduce a volume
dependence to [[file:2021-07-01--13-47-14--lattice_dynamics.org][phonons]] in the [[file:2021-07-01--13-42-08--harmonic_approximation.org][harmonic approximation]], such that one can
find the [[file:2021-03-05--12-06-54--helmholtz_free_energy.org][Helmholtz Free Energy]] at different volumes.

Through use of a [[file:2021-07-23--12-00-07--legendre_transform.org][Legendre transform]], one can find the [[file:2021-03-05--11-50-23--gibbs_free_energy.org][Gibbs Free
Energy]] from the [[file:2021-03-05--12-06-54--helmholtz_free_energy.org][Helmholtz Free Energy]].

\[ G(T,p) = \min_{V} \left[ E_{\text{lat}}(V) + U_{\text{vib} }(V,T) -
TS(V,T) + pV \right]  \]


In the phonopy paper, by Togo [[file:togo2015.org][Togo2015: First principles phonon
calculations in materials science]], we have formulations for
these as
implemented in the ~phonopy~ code.
