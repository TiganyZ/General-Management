#+title: strain-ageing

Dynamic strain aging (DSA) is an /instability/ in plastic flow of
materials, associated with *interaction* between moving [[file:20210105175521-dislocations.org][dislocations]]
and diffusing solutes. This specifically refers to an atomistic/microscopic
process. 

Although sometimes dynamic strain aging is used interchangeably with
the [[file:20210105181239-portevin_le_chatelier_effect.org][Portevin–Le Chatelier effect]] (or serrated yielding), [[file:20210105175322-strain_ageing.org][dynamic strain-aging]] refers specifically to the microscopic mechanism that induces the Portevin–Le Chatelier effect. This strengthening mechanism is related to solid-solution strengthening and has been observed in a variety of fcc and bcc substitutional and interstitial alloys, metalloids like silicon, and ordered intermetallics within specific ranges of temperature and strain rate.
