  A method of finding the total energy from the schrodinger equation by
  using the correspondence between the external potential and the
  electronic density.


    - The external potential and the number of electrons, N, *completely define* the problem.
    - Wavefunctions are defined by the schrodintger equation, from which everything else can be calculated.
    - *The energy and everything else is thus a functional of the external potential and N*
