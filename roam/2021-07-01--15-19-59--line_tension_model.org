A line tension model of a dislocation considers a dislocation as a
discretised line which lives in a substrate potential, which is called
the Peierls potential. Nearest-neighbour points on the line experience
spring forces.

The line tension model has been used to find [[file:2021-03-04--12-29-07--kink_pair_formation_enthalpy.org][kink-pair formation
enthalpies]] by using [[file:2021-03-04--14-44-41--transition_state_theory.org][transition-state theory]] where saddle point
