This describes how a bare external potential is screened to give the
effective potential as seen by an electon.

The classical dielectric function describes how the bare external
potential is screened as seen by a test charge. The difference is that
the test charge sees the potential without the exchange correlation
part.

The inverse of the dielectric function is related to [[file:2021-07-19--09-49-46--linear_response.org][linear response]]
