#+TITLE: Statistically-Stored dislocations
* Summary :SUMMARY:
  These are [[file:20210105175521-dislocations.org][dislocations]] which have been generated by multiplication,
  due to [[file:2021-03-02--17-36-32--dislocation_intersection.org][dislocation intersection]] and so forth. They are opposite
  signed.

  These are dislocations generated by chance/random trapping processes
  during plastic deformation. They have a
  density $\rho_s$
