   This paper details the
   [[file:2021-07-15--09-30-11--electronic_entropy.org][electronic
   entropy]]. Generally this entails a temperature dependent free
   energy, which arises through the temperature dependence of the
   electronic density of states and the explicit dependence on
   tempereture in the
   [[file:2021-07-15--09-31-47--fermi_dirac_distribution.org][Fermi-dirac
   distribution]]. As the charge density is given by

   \[ \rho(\mathbf{r}, T)  = \sum_{i} f(\varepsilon,T) |\Psi_i|^2   \]
   Then, through self-consistency of the charges and potential (and
   hence the eigenvalues), this leads to an explicit $T$ dependence of
   the DOS.

   \[ \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} n(\varepsilon, T) f(\varepsilon, T)
   \text{d}\varepsilon = N_{\text{tot} }\]
