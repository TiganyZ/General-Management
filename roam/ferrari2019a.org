** Summary :SUMMARY:
   Here an [[file:2021-03-03--11-03-38--analytic_bop.org][analytic bop]] model is created by fitting an initial
   tight-binding model and adding an [[file:2021-03-03--11-58-49--embedding_potential.org][embedding potential]]. This was
   used to mimic the contribution of missing s electrons and sd
   hybridisation to the cohesive energy.

   It can account for phase transitions.
