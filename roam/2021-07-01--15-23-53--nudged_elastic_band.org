The nudged elastic band method is a saddle point search method between
an initial and final configuration. This is used in [[file:2021-03-04--14-44-41--transition_state_theory.org][transition-state
theory]], such that one can find energy barriers and intermediate
configurations which are integral to find attempt frequencies and so
forth.

Generally calculations of the rate constant, in harmonic transition
state theory, are done using the phonon frequencies at the initial and
saddle points, by use of [[file:2021-03-04--14-44-41--transition_state_theory.org][transition-state theory]].
