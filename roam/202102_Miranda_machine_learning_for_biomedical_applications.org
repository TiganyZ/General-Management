* Multi-scale approach

  - Use machine learning + first principles
  - Problem: low elastic modulus materials are required to avoid the
    bon stress-shielding effect.
  - Implant materials 60-110GPa
  - Human bond: 5-30 GPa

  - How can we look for materials which have the right properties.
  - Current \beta phase Ti-Nb-Zr-Ta alloy only has 55GPa (gum metal)


  - Can try trial and error: Multidimensional optimisation
    - Parameters/properties are unknown
  - Only the best candidates synthesised. x
  - ML -> Simulation -> theory
* Methodology

  - Use materials project database
  - Use ML: pymatgen, matminer, Keras, TensorFlow
  - DFT simulations, ATAT for SQS structures
  - Finite Elements simulations

  - Composition, structure and get the transition and post-transition
    metals (Ti, Nb)
  - Exclude compunds with ionic/covalent character
  - Elastic properties range for Ti alloys
  - Information on heat of formation and entropy of mixing.

  - Featurization
  - Feature selection
  - Regression


  - ML modelling and obainining the shear modulus.
  - Use SelectKBest, to get the best features
  - Dominant descriptor is the poisson ratio
  - Then one is able to get a phase diagram using the \Delta
    S_{\text{mix}} (of Ti/Zr/Nb)
  - One can find the sweetspot of the elastic moduli.
  - The ML positions are only based on compositon, not structure, but need
    first-principles calculations to see if the structures are stable
    and so forth.
  - Need the beta phase of titanium as it is crucial for the elastic
    properties.
  - Don't want the omega phase, so surpress Zr.
  - Increasing Nb, we stabilise beta.


  - We get reasonable contents of Nb for the biometidal implants.
  - Found potental alternative the TNZT, so found a new material.


  - Then do finite-element analysis using the extracted elastic
    properties of the theoretical material.
