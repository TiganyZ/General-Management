#+title: Schrodinger Equation

- Equivalent of the second law of motion (F=ma) in mechanics but for quantum object.
  - How does an object move with regards to a force?
  - How does a quantum object respond to a potential?
- We find \Psi which is a complex amplitude.
- For one electron

  \[
  -\hslash^2 / 2m \nabla^2 \Psi(r,t) + V(r,t)\Psi(r,t) = i\hslash
  \frac{\partial\Psi(r,t)}}{\partial t}
  \]
