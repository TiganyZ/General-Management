#+TITLE: Moments Theorem
* Summary :SUMMARY:


  The $N^{\text{th}}$ moment of the density of states is given by
  \[ \mu_{i\alpha}^{(N)} = \int E^{N}n_{i\alpha}\text{d}E \]

  One can relate the moments of the local density of states to
  matrix elements of the Hamiltonian:

  \[ \mu_{i\alpha}^{(N)} = \expval{H}{i\alpha} \]

  This links the $N^{\text{th}}$ moment to the sum of all self
  returning hopping path starting and ending on the orbital
  $\ket{i\alpha}$.
