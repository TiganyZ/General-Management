#+TITLE: Lanczos Algorithm
* Summary :SUMMARY:
  This is a method which takes a Hermitian matrix tridiagonalises it,
  by recasting it into a new basis.

  We have an arbitrary starting basis vector) and then subsequently
  orthogonalise.

  Faster to diagonalise, as the matrix is sparse and we can use
  tridiagonalisation algorithms to find the eigenvalues.
