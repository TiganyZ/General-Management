#+TITLE: Finding happiness and saving the world through electronic-structure theory

* Notes

  - Is the [[file:20210225120545-polarisation.org][polarisation]] of a periodic solid bulk quantity, and how
    should it be defined?

  - In a molecule, no ambiquity
  - In periodic solide, have dipole in each cell, therefore can do
    dipole per unit volume $ed/V$.
  - But we have many choices for the unit cell: polarization can point
    in a different direction $-ed/V$.
  - /It gets worse/: centrosymmetric 1d chain.
  - +    -    +    -
  - No zero polarization, but can have polarizations basically for
    anything


** Key result
   - Polarization of a periodic insulating solid is a bulk property
     and is multivalued.
   - $P = P_0 + nP_q * P_q = eR/V*$
   - Centro symmetric insulating solids have centrosymmetric
     polarization lattices that contain either zero or P_q / 2
   - Differences between polarisations the p
   - /A beginners guide to the moder theory of polarization/
   - Can find videos on youtube.


** Perovskite structure: multiferroic bismuth ferrite ,BiFeO3
   - Iron iron at centre of complex of oxygens and they have magnetic
     moments.
   - Two cells which are linked by opposite direction spins.
   - Has magnetic ordering at high temperatures.
   - There is a spontaneous ferroelectric polarisation
   - Surface charge associated with ferroelectricity.
   - Charged surface (such as thin film), is bad news, as the
     polarisation may be surpressed , it can change to be segmented
     etc
   - As a result of the need to screen the surface charge, one can
     find a low energy P=0 state?


   - Lanthanum ferrite is a trivalent ion
   - Sandwich BiFeO3 with LaFeO3
   - Two bismuths go up and two go down going along line
   - Stabilisation of a meta-stable antiferroelectric phase.
   - Electric field destabliizes the new phase in teh
     heterostructure.
   - Can measure antiferroelectric hysteresis.

   - Therefore can /save the world/ through electronic structure.
   - Antiferroelectric materialcs can by energy storage materials.

   - In centrocymetric form the ploarization lattice contains the half
     quantum: +e -e +e layers
   - $\pm ea/2V$
   - By accident the size of the half quantum is equal to the
     spontaneous polarisation.
   - We can actually have a polarization of 0!
   - This means that the /surface charge/ compensates.
   - Size of surface charge from the half quantum is equal to the
     spontaneous polarisation.
   - Spontaneous polarisation is /opposite/ to the polarisation
     orientation to make polarisation of zero.
   - can make very unhappy surfaces where the valence and conduction
     bands are moved due the the electric field if we do the
     opposite.
   - On charge neutral there is a adsorption.
   - On unhappy surface there is dissociation.
   - Therefore we can go from dissociating to adsorbing water through
     changing the surfaces.
