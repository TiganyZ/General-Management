#+TITLE: Bornâ€“Oppenheimer approximation
* Notes
  - Have hamiltonian that consists of interaction between:
      1) nucleus-nucleus
      2) nucleus-electron
      3) electron-electron
** Eigenfunction is product state of electronic GS and nuclear eigenstate :APPROXIMATION:
  - First assumption is that we can write the eigenfunction of this
    large hamiltonian as a product state consisting of an electronic
    ground state and nuclear eigenstate.    \[ \Psi_{\text{total}}  =  \psi_{\text{electronic}}
    \psi_{\text{nuclear}}  \]

** Kinetic energy term wrt nucleus positions is small         :APPROXIMATION:
  - Second approximation is that we are able to say, as the mass of the ion
      $M_{I} \sim 1000 m_{e}$ then we can say that the kinetic energy term of
      with regard to the nucleus positions will be small.
  - From this we can say that the action of this nuclear kinetic energy
      operator on the electronic eigenstate is small.
  - This means we can neglect the *electronic* wavefunction, and work with
      the equation \[ \hat{H}\Phi(\mathbf{R}) = E^0_{\mathbf{R}}\Phi(\mathbf{R}) \]
    - Where $E^{0}_{ \mathbf{R} }$ is the ground state energy hypersurface
        from the electronic wavefunction. We get this from DFT calculations.
  - Even now we can only really calculate 8 degrees of freedom for the
      Nuclear wavefunction.

* Questions :QUESTIONS:
  - What are the approximations made before the BO approximation?
  - How is the BO approximation defined?
  - Under what conditions does the BO approximation fail?
  - What about the interaction between electronic hypersurfaces?
  - What is the adiabatic approximation?
* Summary :SUMMARY:
  - This is the approximation we make where we decouple the motion of
    the nuclei from that of the electrons.
  - Due to the large mass of the nucleus, we can neglect the kinetic
    energy of the nucleus and assume that electrons /instantaneously
    relax/ to their ground state upon movement.
  - This means that the *potential is just a function of the nuclear
    coordinates.*
