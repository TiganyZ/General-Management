   They find that predictions from harmonic [[file:2021-03-04--14-44-41--transition_state_theory.org][transition-state theory]]
   severely diffusivity in these phases.

   Anaharmonic vibration entropic effects come into play to stabilise
   phases at high enough temperatures. This paper looks at the
   "anomalously fast diffusion". The [[file:2021-07-01--13-42-08--harmonic_approximation.org][harmonic approximation]] predicts
   vibrational instablilties in these phases, as such their
   [[file:2021-07-23--11-36-12--diffusivity.org][diffusivity]]. Kadkhodaei suggests that [[file:2021-07-23--11-50-38--anharmonic_effects.org][anharmonic effects]] and
   phonon-phonon coupling effects can accurately describe the
   anomalously large macroscopic diffusision coefficients in the bcc
   phase of IVB metals.
** The stability of bcc ti arises from entropic stabilisation arising from large amplitude anharmonic hopping among local distortions
