** At higher temperatures, where atomic vibrations deviate away, a non-negligible anharmonic contribution to the vibrational entropy will occur

** In the case of interstitials, little is known about the magnitude of the anharmonic contribution to the free energy

** Estimating the free energy becomes problematic when defect diffusion occurs at a time scale comparable to the characteristic vibrational period of the defect

** In this regime, where a diffusion event (hop) may no longer be considered a rare event, the defect cannot reach local thermal equilibrium before the next migration and the concept of a harmonic ground state becomes meaningless

** When this occurs transition state theory does not apply and people use the [[file:2021-07-01--14-34-28--frenkel_kontorova_model.org][Frenkel Kontorova model]]

   - Not really sure how people use the Frenkel kontorova model here
     for say crowdions.
** Uses EAM potentials of Mendelev and Dudarev which reproduces nondegenerate screw core
