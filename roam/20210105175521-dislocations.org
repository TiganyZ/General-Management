#+title: dislocations

A dislocation is a linear crystallographic defect or irregularity
within a crystal structure that contains an abrupt change in the
arrangement of atoms.

The crystalline order is restored on either side of a normal
dislocation (the atoms on one side are displaced with respect to the
others by one atomic position).

 A dislocation defines the boundary between slipped and unslipped
regions of material and as a result, must either form a complete loop,
intersect other dislocations or defects, or extend to the edges of the
crystal.

 A dislocation can be characterised by the distance and direction of movement it causes to atoms which is defined by the [[file:20210105180355-burgers_vector.org][Burgers Vector]]. Plastic deformation of a material occurs by the creation and movement of many dislocations.
