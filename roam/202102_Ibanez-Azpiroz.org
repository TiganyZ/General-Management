#+TITLE: Wannier interpolation for shift current

- In tight binding we have matrix elements like
  $\bra{R_{\text{a}}m } \hat{H} \ket{R_{\text{b}}n }$
- In Wannier interpololation, we have both elements like
  $\bra{R_{\text{a}}m } \hat{H} \ket{R_{\text{b}}n }$, but also like
    $\bra{R_{\text{a}}m } \hat{r} \ket{R_{\text{b}}n }$
- So in tight-binding, the matrix elements with respect to the
  position operator is diagonal, the expectation value of the position
  just corresponds to the point where the orbital is situated.
- But in Wannier we have the full position representation of the
  wavefunction?
