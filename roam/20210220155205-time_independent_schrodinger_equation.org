#+title: Time-independent Schrodinger Equation

- Assume that the potential of the Schrödinger equation is
  *time-independent*.

- Ansatz: $\Psi(r,t) = \phi(r) f(t)$.

- V(r,t) → V(r)
- This gives the equations to be

  \[ \big[-\frac{\hslash^2}{2m}\nabla^2 +
  V(\mathbf{r})\big]\phi(\mathbf{r}) = E\phi(\mathbf{r}) \]

  \[ i\hslash\frac{d}{dt} f(t) = E f(t)\]
- Solution to the second equation does not come into play as generally
  for some observables of the system, we will perform the
  [[file:20210220155652-expectation_value.org][Expectation Value]].
- Complex conjugate multiplication will remove the effect of the
  time-dependent function.
- This is the *Equation of motion* of a quantum object
