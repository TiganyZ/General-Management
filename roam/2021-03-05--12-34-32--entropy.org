  - Entropy is there to account for changes to the [[file:2021-03-05--12-04-48--internal_energy.org][Internal Energy]]
    which are not available to be put into *usable* heat or work.

  - If some process is reversible then the entropy change for the
    cycle is zero.

  - Free energies are the proportions of first-law energies which are
    *available* to do work at constant temperature. (Work mediated by
    thermal energy)


  \[ \text{d}Q = T \text{d} S \]
