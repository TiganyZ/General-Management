** Main points
   - Ising model used to model the equilibrium distribution of carbon
     around screw dislocations in bcc Fe.
   - Fourth neighbour octahedral sites of the hard core (which has
     been reconstructed from the easy core due to the attraction of
     carbon to the prismatic site)  are also attractive with a binding
     energy similar to before.
   - Segregation results as a competition between the repulsive
     carbon-carbon interactions, parallel to the dislocation line, and
     attraction toward the line.
   - This leads to complex ordering phenomena:
     - At high temperatures, in the regime of [[file:20210105175322-strain_ageing.org][dynamical strain-ageing]]
       of steels, the prismatic line of carbons are occupied while the
       octahedral lines are empty.
     - Iso-concentrations for the primatic site are obtained by a
       mean field approach, where monte carlo similations are
       similar.


** Notes

   - The prismatic core reconstruction can be considered to be in a
     local environment close to that of Fe3C, cementite.
   - Forces only converged to 10^-2 eV/\AA.
   - 270 atoms in 2b depth cell.
   - Only one carbon atom used in these cells. Do they modify the
     interaction energy? The periodic array of dipoles will interact
     when the position of the core has changed due to reconstruction.
