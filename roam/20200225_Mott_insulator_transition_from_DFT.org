#+TITLE: Mott-insulator transition from DFT
* DFT
  - One can use the KS orbitals and energies as quasiparticles
  - Can calculate the band structure
  - But band gaps are bad
  - Worst case scenario is the Mott insulator
  - Where the energy gap is $\Delta_{xc}$
* Steady state DFT
  - _Idea_: introduce current $I$ through device as an additional "density"
  - Hohenburg-Kohn for i-DFT:
    \[  (n(\mathbf{r}, I)) \rightarrow (v_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{r}),
    V)\]
  - Kohn-Sham system
        \[  (n(\mathbf{r}, I)) \rightarrow (v_{\text{s}}(\mathbf{r}),
    V_s)\]
  - $V = \mu_{\text{left}} - \mu_{\text{right}}$ so the chemical
    potential between the two different sides of the simulation
* Spectral functions from i-DFT
  - Ideal STM limit
  - Think of STM tip
  - Can find the greens function to get the derivative of I wrt V
  - Can the couple tip to some orbitals
  - Can find the spectral funtion from derivative of i wrt V
  - Equations for density and current decouple.


  1. Solve /equlibrium/ DFT for $n(\mathbf{r})$ and
     $v_{\text{Hxc}}(\mathbf{r})$
* MOtt metal-insulator transitoin
  - Have tight-binding lattice
  - Where we have hubbard interaction
  - correlated metal at low U and Z
    Dynamical Mean-field theory
  - Neglects non-local correlations
  - Quasi particle in the middle of transition disappears (kolar 2004
    physics today)
** Fermi liquid + DMFT conditions for xc-bias
   - From th espectral function we can get relations from half filling
     of spectral derivative.
   - Can relate to the quasi particle weight
   - Mott insulating phase
     n   |   n

   - Metallic phase
     nIn
** xc-bias functional for the modd transition
   - Ansatz: $ V_{\text{xc}} = a(I) \cdot \bar{V}_\text{xc} $
   - Kondo model
   - Mott/coulomb blockade
* Conclusions
  - Can calculate many body spectral functions from i-DFT
  - dft-LIKE COST
  - Kondo effect and coulomb blockade
  - Mott metal-insulator transition within DFT framework.
