#+TITLE: transition-state theory
* Summary :SUMMARY:
  Transiton-state theory describes the relation between activation
  barriers (Gibbs energy barriers) which are at the saddle point of a
  transiton pathway and a /reaction rate/.

  It is similar to an Arrhenius rate equation.

  It is defined in the seminal paper by vineyard [[file:vineyard1957.org][Vineyard1957:
  Frequency factors and isotope effects in solid state rate processes]],
  where he defines harmonic transition state theory to get a rate
  constant.
