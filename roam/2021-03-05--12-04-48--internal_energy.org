     * The capacity to do work and release heat.
     * The energy contained withing the system excluding kinetic energy.
     * Equation: \[ U = \int ( t\text{d}S -p\text{d}V + \sum_{i}\mu_{i}\text{d}N_{i} ) \]
     * $\Delta U$ is the total energy added to the system.
     * Natural variables: $\{ S, V, \{N_{i}\} \}$
