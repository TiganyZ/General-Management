  Force constants are defined in the expansion of the total energy
  of a lattice due to the displacement of an atom in the harmonic
  approximation.

  These are the terms which represent the second derivative of the
  energy surface.

  From Finnis cite:Finnis2003, we know that it is not certain that
  these force constants are not short-ranged. One can try to analyse
  this using the [[file:2021-07-19--09-42-52--hellmann_feynman_theorem.org][Hellmann-Feynman Theorem]]
