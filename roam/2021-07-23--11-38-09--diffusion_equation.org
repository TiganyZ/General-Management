  The diffusion equation has a standard form, if the diffusion
  coefficient is a constant.

\[
    \frac{\partial \rho(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t} = D\nabla^2 \rho(\mathbf{r}, t)
\]



  Generally, in three
dimensions, where the diffusion coefficient is different in each
dimension, but in the single dimension form, we have

#+begin_export latex
  \frac{\partial \rho(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot \left( D(\rho,\mathbf{r}) \nabla \rho(\mathbf{r},t) \right)

For three dimensions we have

#+begin_src latex
  \frac{\partial \rho(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} \left( D_{ij}(\rho,\mathbf{r}) \frac{\partial \rho(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial x_j}  \right)
