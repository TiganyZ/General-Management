  This is the distribution which distributes indistinguishable,
  non-interacting particles between states which have a maximum
  occupancy of one. These are useful for fermions, but they also have
  similarities to other forms of equation, such as the McClean
  Isotherm and the Louat theory of solutes on an effective lattice
  near a defect

  Cottrell Atmospheres]]
