#+TITLE Quasiparticles

- Quasiparticles are the excited states of electrons.
- If one were to think about all of the potential energy states of the
  system, then one can see there are 2^N states, if we simply imagine
  each state to either be /occupied/ or not.
- This is two many states to consider saying 2^10^23 states.
- So we just look at the *excited states*
- These excited states correspond to /combinations of quasiparticles/
