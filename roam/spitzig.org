  - It seems that one may be able to get the actual kink-pair
    formation enthalpy by the following relations:

  - \[ \tau = \tau^* + \tau_i \]
  - $\tau^*$ component (effective stress) is assumed from short-range
    obstacles to dislocation motion:
    - Forest dislocations
    - Impurity atoms
    - Peierls stress

  - \[ \tau^* = 1/V^* [ \Delta H_0 + k_{\text{B}}T \text{ln} (l^*
    \dot{\varepsilon} / (\rho_m A \mathbf{b} \nu^*) )] \]

  - $V^*$ is the /activation volume/
  - $\Delta H_0$ is the activation enthalpy at
  - $l^*$ length of dislocation segment involved in thermal activation.
  - \[ \dot{\varepsilon} \] is the strain rate.
  - $\rho_m$ is mobile dislocation density.
  - $A$ is the area swept out by dislocation in fluctuation.
  - $\mathbf{b}$ is the burger's vector.
  - $\nu^*$ is the frequency of vibration of the dislocation segment
    of length $l^*$
  - Internal stress $\tau_i$ can be estimated from

    \[ \tau_i = \alpha\mu \mathbf{b} \sqrt{\rho}  \]
  - $\mu$ is the shear modulus and $\alpha$ is a constant.

    
  - Assumptions are made that the density of mobile dislocations is
    the same and that the internal stress is constant. 

  
  # - $\sigma \delta \varepsilon = \delta E$
  # - Therefore integrating over all the strain gives the total amount
  #   of energy expended.
  #   - One can integrate to the point of plastic deformation, when the
  #     stress-strain curve becomes flat (start of plastic deformation
  #     stage)
  # - Points of interest, which might be screw dislocations in the
  #   single crystal are: C and A
