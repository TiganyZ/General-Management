  Linear response is a relation to the change in electron
  density/charge upon a change to the external potential.

  In matrix form, in the r representation, we ahve

  \[ \rho - \rho_1 \rightarrow \Delta\rho = \chi_{\text{el} }\Delta V_{\text{ext} } \]

  One can relate this to the inverse of the [[file:2021-07-19--09-55-56--dielectric_function.org][Dielectric function]].
