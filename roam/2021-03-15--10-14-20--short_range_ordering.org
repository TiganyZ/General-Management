  This is where there is a regular and predictable arrangement of
  atoms over a short distance, usually a few atomic spacings.

  An example of being able to get these parameters is given in [[file:hoffmann2016.org][Hoffmann2016: Quantitative description of short-range order and its influence on the electronic structure in Ag-Pd alloys]] .
