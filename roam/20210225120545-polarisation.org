#+title: polarisation

The polarisation of a molecule is a measure of the dipole moment.

Typically $\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{d} \cdot e = \sum_i q_i \mathbf{r}_i$.

In a periodic system we can have the dipole moment per unit volume $ed/V$

From the polarisation we can have the necessary energy equations (for
a /spatially uniform/ electric field).
\[ U = -\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{E}\]

\[ \tau = \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{E}\]
