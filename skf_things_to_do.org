** Binding of carbon to dislocations
   - After trialling dislocation dipole simulations to find the
     binding energy of carbon to dislocations, which unfortunately did
     not come to fruition because of computational time, one succeeded
     in finding the binding energy of carbon to dislocations using the
     cluster method.
   - Firstly, an easy/hard dislocation was introduced according to the
     anisotropic elasticity solutions for a $\langle 111 \rangle$
     screw dislocation to 522 cylindrical cluster of iron atoms.
   - The cell was only one burger's vector in depth in the
     z-direction. 
   - The outer two layers of atoms were fixed and could not relax.
   - This single layer cell had the three atoms around the dislocation
     core fixed, such that the dislocation core did not transform/move upon
     relaxation.
   - This relaxed cell had a 174 atom cylindrical cell cut out. This
     smaller cell was  replicated three times in the z-direction
     and then a carbon interstitial was then introduced into the middle layer at the
     8 closest octahedral sites to the dislocation core, for both the
     easy and hard core.
   - These cells were then relaxed. All relaxations were done to a
     root-mean-square force tolerance of $1$meV. 

   - The dissolution energy (binding energy) of a solute to a
     dislocation is given by 
     
     \[ E^{\text{Sol}}_{\text{C-disl}} = E_{\text{C-disl}} -
     E_{\text{disl}} - \mu_{\text{C}} \]

   - Where $\mu_{\text{C}}$ is the chemical potential necessary to
     add carbon to the system. This is generally given as half of the
     energy necessary to dissociate the diatomic molecular form of the
     solute $\mu_{text{C}} \approx \frac{1}{2} E_{\text{C}_2}$.

   - In Domain-Becquart they actually used a different equation for
     the binding energy of carbon to a dislocation. 

     \[ E_{\text{bind}}^{\text{Screw-Octa}} = E^{\text{Screw}} + E^{\text{Octa}} -
     E^{\text{Screw-Octa}} - E^{\text{reference}}  \]
     
     where a positive binding energy indicates /attraction/ between
     the interstitial and dislocation. 

     I find that this definition makes the most sense: in terms of
     splitting up the energy it makes sense, 
     1. From a perfect lattice, which has a given energy, we add a
        dislocation, which increases the energy of the system as we
        have done work to the system.

     2. To add a solute into the configuration, we must take a solute
        with a given reference energy outside the lattice, lets say on
        the surface of the lattice, and we must first /put it into the
        lattice/. At infinite distance from the dislocation, we add in
        the carbon and the carbon deforms the lattice, doing work.

     3. Then we must take this carbon and do work, against or
        with the stress field from the dislocation, such that we can
        transport the carbon close to the dislocation.

     4. This means that the binding energy of dislocation-solute
        system is  
	
	\[  E_{\text{disl + solute + ref}} - E_{\text{ref}} - 
          ( E_{\text{solute + ref}} -  E_{\text{ref}} )     - 
          ( E_{\text{disl + ref}} - E_{\text{ref}} )      \]

	
	\[  E_{\text{disl + solute + ref}} - E_{\text{solute + ref}}  - E_{\text{disl + ref}} + E_{\text{ref}}       \]

	This would give a more negative binding energy for favourable
        binding. This is the work necessary to bring a carbon from infinity
        in the lattice to the disocation core in that position. It
        would be negative if the dislocation is providing a net
        attractive force to the solute. 

   - We can use the solute binding energies of carbon binding to a
     site as the solute reference. 

   - The energies of all the configurations are as follows.

* TODO Determine Calculations
  DEADLINE: <2019-11-21 Thu>
   
  - What needs to be calculated for the construction of a Kinetic Monte Carlo model?

  - How have the calculations by Wang et al changed anything?

** Preliminary Calculations

   
** TODO Core reconstruction (ECC -> HCC) by C

   It seems like the hard core configuration is stablised by C [[file:papers/2015_PRB%5BVentelon%20et%20al%20Fe-C%5D.pdf]] .
   Is this the same for hydrogen?

   - Shall I start off with the hard core configuration?
   - What is the difference between the easy and the hard core?
    
   - Looking briefly at the Ventelon paper, it seems that 
     - They found a low energy site for the C in the middle of the
       hard dislocation core.  
     - The stablilsation of the hard core is apparent for other
       solutes such at N, O and C. 
     - This low energy core configuration is provides a *strong
       solute-dislocation interaction*
     - This leads to dislocation core saturation for low bulk solute
       concentration. 
     - Important for solute segregation phenomena such as strain aging. 

   - Interestingly, the Domain-Becquart EAM (nor the
     Mendeleev-Ackland), could reproduce the transition of the easy
     core into the hard core. 

   - These potentials infact predict a core spreading. 
   - Is this due to the directionality of the bonding in DFT, that it
     is able to reproduce this result? 
   - Potentially tight binding is the way forward with this model, as
     it may be able to accurately obtain correct structure of the
     dislocation core with Carbon. 

** TODO Reproduction of Forst's paper on defect clusters. 

   [[file:papers/Forst_Point_Defect_Concentrations_in_Metastable_Fe-C_Alloys.pdf]]

** Necessary Calculations
   
    1) Kink-pair formation enthalpy *with* and *without*
       carbon *at different stresses* to find the difference.
       - This is to account the effect of carbon trapped in the core
         ahead of the dislocation line. 
       - Kink-nucleation enthalpy with hydrogen $E_{KH}$ and without
         hydrogen $E_{K}$ was calculated for given shear stresses in
         the $[111](1\bar{1}0)$ direction using *string method* on the
         line tension model.
       - This was done for the dislocation migration path E2-H0-E2.
       - The reduction in the enthalpies is $\Delta E_K = E_K - E_{KH}
         = 110 meV$
    2) *Velocity* of the pure screw segment in $\alpha$-Fe calculated
       *from the KMC* and the *experimentally determined velocity*.
       - This determines the Frequency prefactor $f_{kp}$ by *comparison*.
    3) Solution energies of carbon in different positions around the
       dislocation line
       - To account for changes in the solution enthalpy of the solute
         as a kink sweeps past.
    4) The change in these solution energies with applied stress to
       find $E_t(\sigma)$.
       
* TODO Current Calculations

   
** TODO Core Reconstruction of C with easy core to hard core.
   - This is to check that tight binding, like DFT, can reproduce the
     stablilisation of the hard screw core in bcc by C in a
     neighbouring intersitial site.
   - The EAM by Domain-Becquart does not predict this and so it shoud
     be avoided.
   - It is possible that there are other methods of kink-migration
     that are valid in the EAM compared to tight-binding. 


   
** C-dislocation binding energies

   The cells have been set up for the dislocation binding energies. 
   
   There are some differences in the literature on how one places
   interstitials. 

   Ventelon, in her paper on C-induced screw dislocation
   reconstruction in bcc iron cite:Ventelon2015 put in *two* interstitial carbon atoms,
   one for each of the dislocations in the simulation cell. Where as
   Chaari, in his paper on oxygen-dislocation interaction in titanium
   with first-principles cite:Chaari2018, put only one oxygen atom
   near one of the dislocation cores. Chzran in his work on
   oxygen-dislocation interaction with screw cores, cite:Yu2015, put
   in an oxygen adjacent to each core. 

   This leads me to believe that having a symmetric configuration of
   cores is probably for the best. It means that the cell is truly
   periodic, but this does introduce interactions that would otherwise
   not be there if only one oxygen atom is put in the core. For
   example the interaction of each of the dislocations strain fields
   and each of the oxygen atoms, along with the interaction between
   the strain fields generated by the oxygen atoms. It can be assumed
   that beyond first neighbour interactions, these can be neglected.

   To make the symmetric configuration, all of the octahedral sites
   are found within a unit cell. One takes the 8 sites of increasing
   distance from the core. To generate the same type of site for the
   dislocation of opposite burger's vector, the same configuration of
   sites is made from the perspective of the second dislocation if it
   had been flipped and rotated to match that of the first
   dislocation. 

   This means that the configuration of the sites is symmetric under
   the combined transformation of a rotation of 180\deg about the
   dislocation line a 180\deg rotation about the y-axis.

   This means that each dislocation "sees" the same atom in
   perspective, but it does look like this puts the strain fields out
   of periodicity...

   The open questions in terms of mechanisms are:

   - Can dislocations carry carbon when they move?

   - Do temper carbides dissolve with rolling contact fatigue? Or do
     they grow?



** TODO Details of the context of the project. 

*** Initial microstructure of bearing steel
     
    - Machined bearings are heat treated to produce a *martensitic* microstructure.
    - This is subsequently tempered.
    - In the martensitic and tempered condition, bearing steel consists of at least four different phases.
      1) Retained *austenite*
      2) A tempered *martensitic matrix*
      3) Tempered *transition carbides & cementite*
      4) Dispersed residual *cementite*
	 * This has a structure of $M_3C$ where M can be Mn/Cr.

    - During /Austenisation/ a fraction of the spheroidised cementite dissolves and leads to a carbon enrichment of the austenite. 


**** Austenite

      - This is fcc structure iron ($\gamma$ phase).
      - Generally a solid solution of iron and alloying elements. 

      Austenitization means to heat the iron, iron-based metal, or steel to a temperature at which it changes crystal structure from ferrite to austenite.[3] The more open structure of the austenite is then able to absorb carbon from the iron-carbides in carbon steel. An incomplete initial austenitization can leave undissolved carbides in the matrix.

For some iron metals, iron-based metals, and steels, the presence of carbides may occur during the austenitization step. The term commonly used for this is two-phase austenitization

**** Martensite
     - A very hard phase of iron
     - Formed by quenching from /austenite/ (fcc iron) at such a high rate such that the carbon has no time to diffuse out of the microstructure to form /cementite/.
     - This causes the fcc to transform to the highly strained body-centred tetragonal phase of /martensite/.
     - It is supersaturated with carbon.
     - The shear deformations that result form a /large number of dislocations/, which is the *primary mechanism* for the strengthening of steels.
      
**** Cementite
     - This is the name for the iron carbide Fe_3C
     - It is hard and brittle

**** Ferrite
     This is just bcc iron ($\alpha$ phase)


*** Review of the problem
    - With a bearing on a raceway one can expect a /Hertzian/ distribution of the stress.
    - This leads to a large degree of stress on the /subsurface/ of the raceway.
    - It has been seen in cross sections of the bearing raceway, with an increase in the number of fatigue cycles, after etching, dark and light etched regions start to develop.
    - The light regions correspond to the normal microstructure.
    - Dark regions seem to correspond to regions of high /von Mises/ stress from the Hertzian distribution of the stress.
      - These are called /Dark Etched Regions/ (DERs)
    - Within the DERs there are /white etched bands/ (WEBs).

    - DERs are dark because there is more scattering of the light from the microscope so this implies a larger roughness

    - It is not clear what the microstructure of the dark regions are. Nor what the white etched bands are.

    - It it thought that the development of these regions is due to carbon diffusion and migration.
    - I am not sure how carbon diffusion causes a change in the color of the image.
    - But basically there are a couple of theories into the carbon migration.


*** Structure of DERs
    - DERs are dark because there is more scattering of the light from the microscope so this implies a larger roughness
    - The material is more brittle and hard (but this depends on temperature)
      - Some results have shown that the hardness is similar or that the hardness decreases/increases. There is not a consensus.

    - DER is accomompanied by development of compressive residual stresses.
      - X-ray diffraction has results in line broadening (a broader peak) with harder materials so FWHM is less. 
      - Peak is narrower and higher in DER region so FWHM is higher. 




*** Cambridge's theory

    - The theory is that essentially there are grains of martensite.
    - Within these grains there are carbide precipitates of different types.
    - It is thought that dislocations move in a cottrell atmosphere of carbon and then they deposit it into the precipitates.
    - They tried to validate this claim by looking at atom probe tomography of a portion of the sample.
    - They see near regions of large amounts of carbon, there are regions of decreased carbon content.
    - They try to relate these regions of a high carbon concentration to different forms of carbide but there is debate as to whether the resolution of the APT results to actually determine with certainty what the actual stochiometry of the precipitates are.

       
**** Qualms 

     1) Is it valid to say that the dislocations actually deposit carbon into the carbides?
	* Is there a segregation energy from dislocations to these carbide regions?
	* Predrag is looking at this with some interatomic potentials to see if there is favourable segregation of C from dislocation to precipitate. 
	* Do temper carbides dissolve with rolling contact fatigue?
     2) Experimentalists don't seem to have seen any carbides. They don't think that this mechanism is likely.
     3) It is thought that these carbide precipitates dissolve in the dark region. 
    



*** SKF Theory

    - Think that carbon drags along the cottrell atmosphere with the dislocation.
    - This causes carbon migration.
    - Might also be possible that edge dislocations, due to their high mobility diffuse carbon. 
    - There might also be pipe diffusion of the C down the dislocation line. 
      - This is what the engineers really like
      - Essentially pipe diffusion is where (say with an edge dislocation) a vacancy and an "interstitial" pair are created where the interstitial moves downwards (negative climb direction)
      - If this pair don't annihilate then diffusion takes place and this interstitial will diffuse down the dislocation line


*** Notes from Predrag
      
    - Given a diffusion equation of the form 

      \[ \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = \nabla ( D \nabla c ) - \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{v}c) + R\]

    - Where c is the variable of interest (say concentration)
    - D is the diffusion coefficient (diffusivity)
    - $\mathbf{v}$ is a velocity field that the quantity is moving with.
      - e.g In /advection/ then $c$ is the concentration of salt in a river and $\mathbf{v}$ would be the velocity of the water as a function of time and location.
      - This is a quantity that is /driving the diffusion/. 
    - $R$ Describes sources and sinks of the quantity. 

	
    - In relation to diffusion of carbon, we can say that $c$ is the concentration of carbon.
    - In general the diffusion term (the first term) will be quite small.
    - The velocity term makes the larger contributions. 

    /What is this velocity term composed of in terms of dislocations and carbon diffusion?/

    - One can think of this velocity term as being decomposed into several parts.
    - In a paper by Sadeghi? They relate this velocity term to something of the form 

      \[ \mathvf{v} = \frac{D}{k_B T} W \]

    - Where $W$ is the /work due to dissipation of plastic strain/ defined as (maybe):
      \[ W = \int \sigma \varepsilon^p d^3r \]

    - But one can also think about this in the case of a solute interacting with the strain field of a dislocation. 

      \[ \mathvf{v} = \frac{D}{k_B T} \nabla ( P \Omega) \]

    - Where $\Omega$ is the /misfit volume/.
    - $P$ is the trace of the stress tensor
