* Notes
  
** Introduction

   - Simplest model for dislocation glide that accounts for a Peierls stress is the Line Tension model.
   - Dislocation viewed as an elastic string moving on a periodic substrate potential that corresponds to the Peierls potential $V_P$.
   - Equilibrium shape of the dislocation line $y(x)$ is the solution of a 1D scalar field equation of Klein-Gordon type. 

     \[ -V'_p[ y(x) ] \sigma_A b + T \frac{\partial^2y}{\partialx^2} = 0\]
   - $b$ is the Burgers vector
   - T is the line tension
   - Depending on form of $V_P$ can be called
     - $\phi^2-\phi^4$/Eschelby theory for fourth order polynomial potential

     - Sine-Gordon (SG) / Frenkel-Kontorova (FK) theories for sinusoidal potentials. 

   - Actual form of kink-pair activation enthalpy $H(\sigma_A)$ depends on the slape of te substrate potential, in which classical LT models, /remains invariant./
