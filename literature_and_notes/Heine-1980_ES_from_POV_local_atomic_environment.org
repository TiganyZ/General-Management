* Fundamental Ideas
  
  Using k-space fails when the simulations that we want to do are not periodic. 
  
  So the fundamental quantity that one should be using is the /local density of states/.  This
  is a very important quantity for a few reasons:

  1. It is /invariant/ to the boundary conditions imposed (almost, within a few atomic lengths)
  2. in reality one only has to consider particular
     elements of the Green's function to calculate it.
  3. It forgos the use of Bloch's theorem of which has problems where one change will change
     the eigenstates of the whole crystal when really locally, it should only be affected.

  This is very useful for such things as surfaces. 

  Local density of states is defined as:
