** Introduction

   - Rolling contact on the raceways of bearing generates cyclic
     stresses that extend from the surface to the subsurafce.
   - Maximum shear stress (deviatoric/Von mises stress) controls
     material distortion and is responsible for onset of material
     damage in terms of plasticity and fatigue. 
   - Failure caused by accumulation of damage, called Rolling Contact
     fatigue (RCF).

   - Low lubrication can lead to metal-to-metal concact, leading to a
     high surface deviatoric stress.
   - Also high surface stress can be from excessive surface traction.
   - Surface fatigue failure often manifests as micro pitting. 

   - When the bearing is operating under good lubrication
     conditions /the bearing may fail due to crack initiation and
     propagation from the subsurface/.

   - This is characterised by /isolated spalls/ on the raceway.
   - Spall are flakes of a material that are broken off a larger
     solid body and can be produced by a variety of mechanisms,
     including as a result of projectile impact, corrosion,
     weathering, cavitation, or excessive rolling pressure (as in
     a ball bearing)
  
   - There are two types of fatigue damage that may develop in the
     subsurface of a bearing.
   - If the *contact stress exceeds* the /elastic shakedown limit/
     the /subsurafce material undergoes gradual progressive
     plastic flow/.
     - Consequently, /large-scale microstructure alteration/ or
       decay will develop in the form of *dark etching regions*
       (DERs).
     - This is followed by the development of *white etching bands*
       (WEBs), which can by low/high angle (LABs/HABs) which have
       approximate angles of 30/80 degrees respectively.
     - This is classed as *global damage*. 
   - At *contact stress below* the elastic shakedown limit,
     localized damage can still develop in the form of material
     defects/stress risers such as *inclusions*
     - This is characterised by the so-called butterfly with
       single or multiple cracks initiated from an inclusion or
       pore.
     - Growth of crack is accompanied by the development of
       *white etching regions* (WERs).
     - The subsurface crack with grow initially in a co-planar
       manner and later kink or branch into multiple cracks
       towards he raceway, leading to spalling.
     - This is classed as *localised damage*.
     - It is called DER as it seems to be more reactive to the
       etchant that is typically used to reveal the microstructure
       of steel. 
   - Etching generally is just to reveal microstructural features
   - Chemical etching degrades certain types of microstructural
     features, similar to electrochemical etching
     (electropolishing at a lower current). 

** Characterisation of the altered microstructure

   - There are 4 factors that promote the formation of DERs, the:
     1) Susceptibility of the initial microstructure
     2) Magnitute of contact pressure
     3) Operating/test temperature.

*** Inital microstructure

   - Spheroidising heat treatment to soften initial steel for machining
   - Heat treated to form a martensitic microstructure
   - Tempered at low temperature
   

   - There are at least four different phases in the steel 
     1) Dispersed residual cementite
	* This is just Fe₃C (iron carbides)
     2) Retained austenite (fcc/γ-iron).
     3) Tempered Martensitic matrix
     4) Tempered transition carbides and cementite (M₃C)
	* M can by Cr / Mn /Fe. 

   - Austenitisation occurs around 840-860°C
   - During this process a fraction of the spheroidised cementite
     dissolves and leads to a /carbon enrichment/ of austenite.
   - Upon quenching in oil, martensite forms.
   - After low temperature tempering 160-170°C transition
     carbides and tempered cementite precipitate and 10-15% of
     austenite is retained.
