* Summary 

  
* Notes

** Introduction

   - Rolling contact on the raceways of bearing generates cyclic
     stresses that extend from the surface to the subsurafce.
   - Maximum shear stress (deviatoric/Von mises stress) controls
     material distortion and is responsible for onset of material
     damage in terms of plasticity and fatigue. 
   - Failure caused by accumulation of damage, called Rolling Contact
     fatigue (RCF).

   - Low lubrication can lead to metal-to-metal concact, leading to a
     high surface deviatoric stress.
   - Also high surface stress can be from excessive surface traction.
   - Surface fatigue failure often manifests as micro pitting. 

   - When the bearing is operating under good lubrication
     conditions /the bearing may fail due to crack initiation and
     propagation from the subsurface/.

   - This is characterised by /isolated spalls/ on the raceway.
   - Spall are flakes of a material that are broken off a larger
     solid body and can be produced by a variety of mechanisms,
     including as a result of projectile impact, corrosion,
     weathering, cavitation, or excessive rolling pressure (as in
     a ball bearing)

   - *Elastic shakedown* behavior is one in which plastic
     deformation takes place during running in, while due to
     residual stresses or strain hardening the steady state is
     perfectly elastic.

   - *Plastic shakedown* behavior is one in which the steady state
     is a closed elastic-plastic loop, with no net accumulation
     of plastic deformation.
  
   - There are two types of fatigue damage that may develop in the
     subsurface of a bearing.
   - If the *contact stress exceeds* the /elastic shakedown limit/
     the /subsurafce material undergoes gradual progressive
     plastic flow/.
     - Consequently, /large-scale microstructure alteration/ or
       decay will develop in the form of *dark etching regions*
       (DERs).
     - This is followed by the development of *white etching bands*
       (WEBs), which can by low/high angle (LABs/HABs) which have
       approximate angles of 30/80 degrees respectively.
     - This is classed as *global damage*. 
   - At *contact stress below* the elastic shakedown limit,
     localized damage can still develop in the form of material
     defects/stress risers such as *inclusions*
     - This is characterised by the so-called butterfly with
       single or multiple cracks initiated from an inclusion or
       pore.
     - Growth of crack is accompanied by the development of
       *white etching regions* (WERs).
     - The subsurface crack with grow initially in a co-planar
       manner and later kink or branch into multiple cracks
       towards he raceway, leading to spalling.
     - This is classed as *localised damage*.
     - It is called DER as it seems to be more reactive to the
       etchant that is typically used to reveal the microstructure
       of steel. 
   - Etching generally is just to reveal microstructural features
   - Chemical etching degrades certain types of microstructural
     features, similar to electrochemical etching
     (electropolishing at a lower current). 


** Characterisation of the altered microstructure

   - There are 4 factors that promote the formation of DERs, the:
     1) Susceptibility of the initial microstructure
     2) Magnitute of contact pressure
     3) Operating/test temperature.

*** Inital microstructure

   - Spheroidising heat treatment to soften initial steel for machining
   - Heat treated to form a martensitic microstructure
   - Tempered at low temperature
   

   - There are at least four different phases in the steel 
     1) Dispersed residual cementite
	* This is just Fe₃C (iron carbides)
     2) Retained austenite (fcc/γ-iron).
     3) Tempered Martensitic matrix
     4) Tempered transition carbides and cementite (M₃C)
	* M can by Cr / Mn /Fe. 

   - Austenitisation occurs around 840-860°C
   - During this process a fraction of the spheroidised cementite
     dissolves and leads to a /carbon enrichment/ of austenite.
   - Upon quenching in oil, martensite forms.
   - After low temperature tempering 160-170°C transition
     carbides and tempered cementite precipitate and 10-15% of
     austenite is retained. 

     

*** Development of DER

    - Initiates in the region of maximum resolved shear stress
      and then spreads outwards to the other stressed regions as
      the number of cycles increases.
    - Figures show that formation depends on the number of cycles
      and the shear stress.
    - High contact pressure is known to promote DER. 

    - Development of the DER with the number of stress cycles
      develops asymmetrically (more DER develops downwards than
      towards the raceway) with the number of stress cycles. 

    - DER formation manifests changes in the hardness.
      - Fatigue hardening or softening can occur depending on the
        contact pressure. 
      - Micro hardness measurements show that in the DER region
        there are hardness decreases at longer stress cycles.
      - In other work high contact pressures increase the
        hardness of the material
      - Low contact pressures have unclear results.

      - Other results show that while the hardness of DER
        increases the FWHM of the (211) ferrite (bcc/α-Fe)
        decreases. 
      - This indicates a /reduction in dislocation density in
        DERs/.
    

*** Temperature
    
    - Depending on the bearing design, heat may not be dissapated
      instantaneously.
    - High operating temperatures have been known to accelerate
      formation of DERs. 

    - There is conflict about what happens to DERs with
      temperature.
    - Lund found significant hardness decreases at 60°C operating
      temperature.
    - But Voskamp found at 70°C and stress cycles (10⁹) and
      contact pressure of 3.3 GPa, the hardness /decreased/.
    - But also showed an increase in hardness at 45°C and 55°C. 

    - At 3.3 GPa and 70°C there was no change in hardness.
    - At 3.8 GPa and 90°C the hardness /decreased/. 



*** X-ray Diffraction 
    
    - Formation of DER accompanied by the development of
      compressive residual stresses and changes in the FWHM.
    - There is line broadening of the x-ray.
    - With harder material (when the bearing is new) the peak is
      broader.
    - So sharper peaks indicate the formation of DER. 

    - From this one can see the development of DER under the
      raceway.
    - Residual stress develops rapidly in the shake-down phase
      and then stabilises near the surface.
    - Residual stress seems to gradually increase from the
      deficit attributed to DER. 



** Microstructure behaviour and phenomena 
   

*** Groove formed on the raceway
    - Groove formed on the raceway. 
    - Below a critical sliding velocity there will be a mixed
      regime of lubrication, where the thickness of the
      lubrication film becomes smaller than the size of the
      surface asperities. 
    - Asperity means a region of roughness. (After polishing a
      surface well there are still /asperities/).
    - So the /real area/ of contact during rolling is the
      asperities, which is much smaller than the apparent area
      calculated by Hertz theory.
    - This results in a very high localised stress at the contact
      tips. Resulting in the breakage of asperities and
      smoothening of the surface. 

*** Microstructure of DER
    - Formation of DERs is related to the Hertzian stress
      distribution.
    - Initial formation is affected by the orientation of the
      martensite packet. 

    - Optical microscopy shows the DER as darker but cannot
      resolve any more details. 
    - Darker as there is more scattering of light which typically
      means that the region is rougher.
    - This is generally due to *smaller grain sizes or multiple
      phases / more interfaces*.
    

**** Ferrite Microbands

    - Characterisation can be perfomed with SEM, focussed ion
      beam (FIB) to allow production of position specific TEM
      lamella.
    - Detection starts with /formation of ferrite microbands/.
      - Also called: slip motions, troosite/mechanical troosite,
        tempered martensite, upper bainite/microslip/deformation
        bands, needle-like structures, acicular structures and
        elongated cells.
    - Martensite decay term used when acutal product of
      microstructural alteration is unclear. 

    - Microbands extend across martensite plate boundaries.
    - They are parallel to the surface when looking at transverse
      cut.
    - Microscopic lining up must be due to the applied stress.
    - This implies their formation is caused by applied strain
      during RCF.
      - Not due to local heating effects from the release of
        strain energy.

    - Early DER shows patches of densely spaced microbands within
      an unaltered matrix.
    - Microbands are parallel to raceway on both sides of the
      symmetry plane (looking down the raceway). In the centre
      there is no preferential alignment.
    - Multivariant ferrite microbands have been seen.
    
    - Later DER: regions of homogeneous nanocrystalline ferritic
      structure can be observed.
      - Other names include polycrystal cell, cell-like
        structure, heavily deformed ferrite and globular
        ferrite.
    - Electron diffraction indicates presence of multiple grains
      with random crystal orientations.
    - Evidence suggests that 30° and 80° WEBs are composed of
      nanocrystalline ferrite. 

    - TEM shows evidence of *dislocation cell* formation in
      fatigue-damaged microstructures.
    - *Dislocation cells* can form in metals with a characteristic
      size defined by three-dimensional tangles of dislocations
      that serve as “walls” and less dense internal regions.
    - In this imaged DER grain size is relatively large compared
      to nano-poly-crysalline ferrite in WERs.
    - The residual cementite is /not fully dissolved/ within the
      80° bands.
    - There seem to be misorientations of the ferrite bands
      across cell walls.
    - Both angles of WEBs are typically longer in length than the
      austenite grains.
    - Seem to form across many prior austenite grains with no
      observable deviation. 

**** Elongated Ferrite

     - Elongated ferrite seen in DERs.
     - Elongated ferrite also formed in martensitic matrix
       structure during RCF, but appears as *individual
       features*, not grouped (unlike ferrite microbands).
     - Also called stringers
     - Possible that ferrite microbands start from elongated
       ferrite. 

     - Elongated ferrite may grow to large ferrite grains
       observed in 30° and 80° WEBs.
     - Composed of thin ferrite plates and lies at 30°/60° to the
       raceway surface as seen in parallel section.
     - It is not polycrystalline. 

     - Both 30° and 80° WEBs can be made up of polycrystalline
       nano size ferrite and elongated ferrite. 

**** Decomposition of retained austenite

     - Retained austenite alters the response of the material
     - It transforms to martensite during the first stress cycles
       causing an increase in the yield stress.
     - Rapid shakedown during rolling contact also causes this.
     - This *increases the dislocation density* within the
       martensite.
     - Decrease in retained austenite is at the beginning of the
       test and there is no observable difference in the imaging.

**** Dissolution/growth of residual carbides
     - Residual cementite is harder than martensite matrix so
       should resist plastic deformation.
     - But both elongated ferrite and ferrite microbands are
       observed to grow into the residual cementite causing it to
       dissolve.
     - Also soft edges to the cementite particles indicating
       cementite dissolving during contact rolling fatigue 

**** Lenticular Carbides

     - Typically formed on the side and parallel to the large
       WEBs.
     - WEB is around 50-60μm in width.
     - Lenticular carbide around 1μm.
     - Appearence of WEBs accompanied by lenticular carbides.
     - Formation and growth of lenticular carbides must be
       related to the dissolution of tempered carbides and
       residual cementite which increases the carbon content
       within the DER.
     - And the reduction of the solubility of carbon within the
       WEBs.
     - Formation of carbides is related to the partial dissolution
       of the residual cementite (it does not need full
       dissolution). 

**** Carbon redistribution 

     - Redistribution of carbon has been seen within APT.
     - Fu claimed that carbon rich regions correspond to
       cementite and other transistion carbides. 

**** Dislocation density 

     - XRD (X-ray powder diffraction) can assess the retained
       austenite content, texture formation and residual stress
       build-up after rolling contacty fatigue.
     - Dislocation density can be determined by the analysis of
       line broadening. 

**** Hardness

     - This can be seen to be dependent on where the cross
       section is taken.
     - Slight hardening seen in the cross section
     - But softening seen in the parallel section.
     

** Mechanisms

*** Jones 
    - Suggests DERs are a structural change that appears in the
      form of areas of ferrite microbands of lower hardness than
      the original martensite.
    - Hertzian stress and internal friction of the material
      originate the transformation of some of the inflicted
      shear energy into heat.
    - Accumulation of heat generated due to cyclic stressing of
      the material leads to decay of hard martensitic phase to
      the formation of the ferrite microbands.
    - Phase transformation is result of subsurface
      tempering. (Shear strain energy theory). 



**** Comments
     - Necessitation of energy to transform into heat is
       questionable.
     - Differentiation of DER from tempered martensite


*** Bush 
    - DER is stress affected zone due to the fact it is initiated
      in the region of maximum reversed orthogonal shear stress.
    - Propose augmentation of the coverage of DER is a
      consequence of the nucleation of additional transformed
      areas.
    - This is instead of a consequence of the growth of
      previously formed dark areas.
    - This is because there is a threshold stress for emergence
      of DERs.
    - Nucleation of DER is a result of yielding/plastic flow
      instead of a thermal effect.
    
    - Don't agree with heat tempering theory.
    - Propose transformation is governed by an exchange of
      material between the carbides and the matrix.
    - This is evidenced by the formation of intrusions/extrusions
      within the microstructure.
    - Intrusion is region of different microstructure within region
    - Extrusion is on the surface instead of inside. 

**** Comments
      - Compare structure of DER to tempered martensite.
      - In both cases there is a change in hardness.
      
*** Swahn 

    - DER is a mixture of
      1) ferritic phase with inhomogeneously distributed carbon
      2) residual martensite from original microstructure. 

    - Transformation mechanisms are a /result of carbon
      redistribution/ present in solution of martensite.
      - And the dissolution of carbides.

    - Propose chronological order
      1) *stress induced carbon diffusion* leads to *diffusion* of
         carbon *from martensitic lattice* towards various *defects*
         in the material *(dislocations)*
      2) Then as plastic deformation accumulates the movement of
         dislocations creates carbon rich grain boundary-type
         interfaces. 



**** Comments 
     - Seems resonable but it did not incorporate the dissolution
       of carbides.
     - Not sure about the role of carbide dissolution in DERs,
       What time scale?


*** Voskamp
    - Stress induced phase transformations not improbable when
      material subjected to cyclic loads. 
    - Cyclic stresses increase the temperature
    - Diffusion of atomic carbon in martensitic matrix
    - With diffusion of carbon, *dislocations that were previously
      trapped by the carbon are no longer pinned.*
    - Potential slip systems activated.
    - Movement of unpinned dislocations cause plastic
      deformation. 

**** Comments
     - Hard to prove local temperature rise causes carbon to
       diffuse.
     - Questionable whether step of mobilising carbon to unpin
       dislocations are necessary as high enough stress can force
       pinned dislocations to move. 

*** Polonsky
    
    - Initially all carbon is /segregated to dislocations/ in the
      form of atmospheres.
      - This is due to the high dislocation density of
        martensite.
    - Concurrently, dislocations are pinned by the carbon.
    - When stress is applied, some dislocation become unpinned
      and are mobile.
    - /This initates dislocation multiplication/annihilation/
    - During annihilaton, the associated carbon atmosphere of the
      dislocations just become in ordinary solution.
    - So segregated carbon (in dislocations) decreases, while the
      amount of carbon in solution increases.
    - This solute carbon is then available for *diffusional
      flow*.
    - This results in ferritic microbands.

 **** Comments
     - Process of dislocation annihilation not properly
       discussed. 

*** Hedman/Slycke

    - "Remaining life model"
    - Material degredation of DER described by growth of carbides.
    - Strength of material given by /Orowan's Law/:
      - This describes the precipitation strengthening of a
        material.
    - Size of carbides used as a measure of material strength.
    - Changing carbide sized during operation are modelled on the
      basis of /Ostwald ripening/ due to diffusion.
    - Diffusion is both thermal and mechanical (by dislocations).

**** Comments
     - Based on redistribution of carbon between carbides.
     - Applicibility is limited as /dislocation glide is crucial
       in this model/.
     - Another limitation is that it should not work for contact
       pressures leading to stresses below the yield limit. 

*** Slycke 

    - Proposed creep-based material degredation model in addition
      to above.
    - Strong in describing the groove formation.
    - Shakedown phase described by Ludwik power-law strain
      hardening relation.
    - Expression for constant damage-driving cyclic shear stress
      used that can be used to calculate creep deformation.
      - Arrhenius term present with an activation term. 
    - Activation energy depends on carbon and nitrogen content in
      steel.

    - Basis of model is that creep-deformation is controlled by
      /vacancies/.
    - Dislocation glide is stopped at obstacle (vacancies) and
      then the obstacle is passed by dislocation climb.
    - Thereby a slow and continous process is present that deforms
      slowly the material under RCF.
    - Deformation is /time dependent/ not /cycle dependent/.

**** Comments 

     - Gives accurate description of material deformation.
     - Activation energy data is available for many classes of
       steel. 
     - Open issue: the change in carbide structure and how that
       influences dislocation movement during time.
     - Assumption is that the glide part of the movement is
       negligible in comparison with the climb part.
     - But if the number of obstacles is changing, the total
       deformation may change as well.
     - Another question is if dislocation climb is possible at
       the bearing operating temperatures. 

*** Fu /et al./
    - DERs are a mixture of DER ferrite patches distributed in
      parent martensite matrix.
    - Formation of DER is strain-induced and caused by orthogonal
      shear component of the stress inflicted by the Hertzian
      contact characteristic of rolling.

    - Fundamental mechanism driving formation of DER is /carbon
      migration/ under RCF driven by *gliding dislocations*.

    - Initially material at the surface experiences pulsating
      stresses as a result of cyclic rolling contact.
    - Strain generated by these stresses allow the dislocations
      to escape their carbon-rich atomsphere.
    - *Free dislocations* behave now as places of stress
      concentration and *re-attract the carbon atoms* that composed
      the Cottrell atmosphere.
    - Step-wise motion of dislocations and carbon generates a net
      carbon flux that ends when the carbon reaches a carbide
      precipitate. (Nano-sized temper carbides). 

**** Comments 
     - There is no experimental evidence that this hypothesis is
       correct since carbides observed in DER do not have any
       orientation relationship with the adjacent
       ferrite/martensite.
     - Carbides/cementite that grow from martensite should have
       Bagaryatskii/Isaichev orientation relationship.
     - Observed cementite within DER/WEB is in an irregular
       shape.
     - It must be from the incomplete dissolution of residual
       cementite. 

*** Šmelova 

    - Used LOM, SEM, EBSD, EDX, TEM to study DERs.
    - Find DERs as a combination of:
      1) Small black patches intermixed with
      2) bright areas
      3) small white primary spheroidised carbides
      4) with residues of retained austenite. 
    - Small black patches correspond to clusters of small
      globular/elongated ferritic grains
      - Formed during the early stages of the microstructural
        alterations due to RCF.
    - Based on low misorientation between adjacent grains, the
      occurrence of high-angle grain boundaries and pronounced
      γ-fibre texture that new ferritic grains are the result of
      recrystallisation processes
    - Maybe even dynamic recrystallisation. 

    - Bright areas in LOM correspond to parches of unaltered
      martensite from the initial microstructure.
    - The spheroidised (primary/residual carbides) are initally
      not affected by the decay of the microstructure and are
      chemically and crystallographically unaltered.
      - Does this mean that it is just the tempered carbides that
        dissolve? 

    - Retained austenite present in the initial microstructure
      was partially decomposed and transformed into martensite
      int the altered region.

    - Not clear to what degree the austenite decomposed and how
      it is related to the subsequent alterations. 



** Modelling Strategies
   


**  Discussion 
*** Factors that affect DER formation
**** Residual Austenite
    - No investigation has been done into effect of amount of retained
      austenite on DER formation.
    - Residual austenite transforms into martensite during the
      shakedown stage and is likely to be stress assisted.
    - Total residual austenite transformation can be expected in DER
      region due to higher stresses. 
**** Silicon addition
     - Silicon has been reported to prevent formation of DER but how
       it is preventative has not been discussed.
     - Expansion of DER found to correspond with sharp reductio of
       retained austenite content.
     - Silicon prevents austenite decomposition during bainite
       transformation as it hinders cementite formation.
     - Silicon addition inhibits growth of \varepsilon-carbides
     - Fine \varepsilon-carbides in martensitic matrix would prevent the
       rearrangement of dislocations and thus prevent DER formation. 
**** Operating Conditions 
     - Higher operating temperatures accelerate the formation of DER.
     - Size of DER increases with contact pressure and number of
       stress cycles.
     - Ferrite microbands in DERs transform into nanocrystalline
       ferrite with number of cycles.
     - Nanocrystalline ferrite grain size has not been investigated.
     - Potentially appearance of 30 and 80 degree WEB is related to
       the moment that nanocrystalline ferrite reaches a smaller grain
       size so the non-etching characteristic is reproduced.
**** Microstructure of DER

     - *Origin* of DER is due to *formation of ferrite microbands and
       elongated ferrite grains*.
     - *Formation of ferrite microbands and elongated ferrite* are
       *related to the dislocation rearrangement* under cyclic applied
       stress*.
     - *Movement and rearrangement of dislocations* during formation
       of ferrite microbands and elongated ferrite *dissolve the
       tempered cementite and the residual cementite*.
     - Some claim that presence of transition carbides is evidence of
       carbon migration from tempered martensite to existing carbides
       but actually the grain size of carbides is getting smaller,
       which indicates *dissolution*. 
       
***** Dissolution of Cementite 
      
      - Indistince edges have been observed on residual cementite
        within DER *indicating partial dissolution*.
      - Pile-up of dislocations created by RCF expected to be formed
        mainly at martensitic matrix and at the interfaces of residual
        cementite.
      - Dislocation pile-up would draw out and trap a dignificant
        amount of carbon from the cementite towards the dislocations
        near the cementite/matrix interface.
      - This is due to higher interaction energy of carbon with
        dislocations (0.8 eV/atom) compared to the Fe-C binding energy (0.5
        eV/atom).
      - Also, tempered carbides could be dissolved by this process,
        and is evidenced by the higher concentration of C in the DER
        regions compared to the initial martensitic matrix.
      - Dissolution process is accelerated by pipe diffusion of C
        along dislocation line. This is orders of magnitude faster
        than carbon diffusion in the normal material.
      - There is no well-defined orientation relationship between
        the carbides and the DER. 

***** Formation of lenticular cementite 

      - Formation of lenticular carbides is related to dissolution of
        both tempered cementite and partial dissolution of residual
        cementite and the reprecipitation of cementite.
      - Elongated ferrite is essentially free of carbon, carbon can
        by forced to partition into surrounding region, one can expect
        that the formation of lenticular carbides is related to the
        formation of elongated ferrite.
      - Around double the amount of carbon that would be expected to
        be ejected from the ferrite is found in the lenticular
        carbides, suggesting that the carbon content in the carbides
        is not only from the elongated ferrite, but also from the
        nanocrystalline ferrite.
      - Nanocrystalline ferrite has a high carbon solubility.
      - Thought to be responsible for the partial dissolution of
        tempered and residual carbides.
      - But with RCF there is an indication that with increasing
        strain the ability of grain boundaries to retain carbon is reduced
      - With increasing deformation, dislocation density is reduced
        while cell size is decreased.
      - Not all lenticular carbides form adjacent to elongated ferrite
      - This means that carbon is rejected from the nanocrystalline
        ferrite after long stress cycles. 


**** Cracks within DER
     - Subsurface cracks are formed within DER
     - Resoned that formation of softer DER initiates the crack. 


*** Proposal of DER formation mechanism

    - Ferrite microbands and elongated ferrite formation *depend on*
      *dislocation motion and rearrangement and carbon migration*.
    - Large plastic strains accumulate during each stress cycle.
    - DER should be related to the dislocation configurations at a
      particular number os stress cycles with the effect of dissolved
      C.
    - Dislocation propagation, slip, annihilation and recombination
      can form dislocation cell-like structures.
    - Entangled dislocations rearrange themselves into sub-boundaries
      with orientations along low-index crystallographic planes.
    - Such structures share the same features as the ferrite
      microbands and the elongated ferrite.
    - With RCF misorientation across the boundaries increases leading
      to the formation of the equiaxed cell structure
      (*nanocrystalline ferrite / WEB*).
    

    - Fundamentally *it is dislocation interaction with carbides*,
     (temper and residual) and *dissolved carbon* that will govern
     the formation of DER.
    - Both tempered carbides and residual cementite met by the
      dislocations would be dissolved and removed.
    - Carbon atoms that occupy the dislocation cores (or strain
      field/carbon atmospheres) after the dissolution of carbides
      would also affect the dislocation movement and its
      rearrangement.
    - No attempt to relate dislocation rearrangement/interactions
      which occur during cyclic stressing in laboratory to RCF in
      bearings. 

    - Dislocation models for DER formation can explain hardening and
      softening with the effect of contact pressure.
