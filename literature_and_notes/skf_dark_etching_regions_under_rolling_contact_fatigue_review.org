** Introduction

   - Rolling contact on the raceways of bearing generates cyclic
     stresses that extend from the surface to the subsurafce.
   - Maximum shear stress (deviatoric/Von mises stress) controls
     material distortion and is responsible for onset of material
     damage in terms of plasticity and fatigue. 
   - Failure caused by accumulation of damage, called Rolling Contact
     fatigue (RCF).

   - Low lubrication can lead to metal-to-metal concact, leading to a
     high surface deviatoric stress.
   - Also high surface stress can be from excessive surface traction.
   - Surface fatigue failure often manifests as micro pitting. 

   - When the bearing is operating under good lubrication
     conditions /the bearing may fail due to crack initiation and
     propagation from the subsurface/.

   - This is characterised by /isolated spalls/ on the raceway.
   - Spall are flakes of a material that are broken off a larger
     solid body and can be produced by a variety of mechanisms,
     including as a result of projectile impact, corrosion,
     weathering, cavitation, or excessive rolling pressure (as in
     a ball bearing)
  
   - There are two types of fatigue damage that may develop in the
     subsurface of a bearing.
   - If the *contact stress exceeds* the /elastic shakedown limit/
     the /subsurafce material undergoes gradual progressive
     plastic flow/.
     - Consequently, /large-scale microstructure alteration/ or
       decay will develop in the form of *dark etching regions*
       (DERs).
     - This is followed by the development of *white etching bands*
       (WEBs), which can by low/high angle (LABs/HABs) which have
       approximate angles of 30/80 degrees respectively.
     - This is classed as *global damage*. 
   - At *contact stress below* the elastic shakedown limit,
     localized damage can still develop in the form of material
     defects/stress risers such as *inclusions*
     - This is characterised by the so-called butterfly with
       single or multiple cracks initiated from an inclusion or
       pore.
     - Growth of crack is accompanied by the development of
       *white etching regions* (WERs).
     - The subsurface crack with grow initially in a co-planar
       manner and later kink or branch into multiple cracks
       towards he raceway, leading to spalling.
     - This is classed as *localised damage*.
     - It is called DER as it seems to be more reactive to the
       etchant that is typically used to reveal the microstructure
       of steel. 
   - Etching generally is just to reveal microstructural features
   - Chemical etching degrades certain types of microstructural
     features, similar to electrochemical etching
     (electropolishing at a lower current). 

** Characterisation of the altered microstructure

   - There are 4 factors that promote the formation of DERs, the:
     1) Susceptibility of the initial microstructure
     2) Magnitute of contact pressure
     3) Operating/test temperature.

*** Inital microstructure

   - Spheroidising heat treatment to soften initial steel for machining
   - Heat treated to form a martensitic microstructure
   - Tempered at low temperature
   

   - There are at least four different phases in the steel 
     1) Dispersed residual cementite
	* This is just Fe₃C (iron carbides)
     2) Retained austenite (fcc/γ-iron).
     3) Tempered Martensitic matrix
     4) Tempered transition carbides and cementite (M₃C)
	* M can by Cr / Mn /Fe. 

   - Austenitisation occurs around 840-860°C
   - During this process a fraction of the spheroidised cementite
     dissolves and leads to a /carbon enrichment/ of austenite.
   - Upon quenching in oil, martensite forms.
   - After low temperature tempering 160-170°C transition
     carbides and tempered cementite precipitate and 10-15% of
     austenite is retained. 

     

*** Development of DER

    - Initiates in the region of maximum resolved shear stress
      and then spreads outwards to the other stressed regions as
      the number of cycles increases.
    - Figures show that formation depends on the number of cycles
      and the shear stress.
    - High contact pressure is known to promote DER. 

    - Development of the DER with the number of stress cycles
      develops asymmetrically (more DER develops downwards than
      towards the raceway) with the number of stress cycles. 

    - DER formation manifests changes in the hardness.
      - Fatigue hardening or softening can occur depending on the
        contact pressure. 
      - Micro hardness measurements show that in the DER region
        there are hardness decreases at longer stress cycles.
      - In other work high contact pressures increase the
        hardness of the material
      - Low contact pressures have unclear results.

      - Other results show that while the hardness of DER
        increases the FWHM of the (211) ferrite (bcc/α-Fe)
        decreases. 
      - This indicates a /reduction in dislocation density in
        DERs/.
    

*** Temperature
    
    - Depending on the bearing design, heat may not be dissapated
      instantaneously.
    - High operating temperatures have been known to accelerate
      formation of DERs. 

    - There is conflict about what happens to DERs with
      temperature.
    - Lund found significant hardness decreases at 60°C operating
      temperature.
    - But Voskamp found at 70°C and stress cycles (10⁹) and
      contact pressure of 3.3 GPa, the hardness /decreased/.
    - But also showed an increase in hardness at 45°C and 55°C. 

    - At 3.3 GPa and 70°C there was no change in hardness.
    - At 3.8 GPa and 90°C the hardness /decreased/. 



*** X-ray Diffraction 
    
    - Formation of DER accompanied by the development of
      compressive residual stresses and changes in the FWHM.
    - There is line broadening of the x-ray.
    - With harder material (when the bearing is new) the peak is
      broader.
    - So sharper peaks indicate the formation of DER. 

    - From this one can see the development of DER under the
      raceway.
    - Residual stress develops rapidly in the shake-down phase
      and then stabilises near the surface.
    - Residual stress seems to gradually increase from the
      deficit attributed to DER. 



** Microstructure behaviour and phenomena 
   

*** Groove formed on the raceway
    - Groove formed on the raceway. 
    - Below a critical sliding velocity there will be a mixed
      regime of lubrication, where the thickness of the
      lubrication film becomes smaller than the size of the
      surface asperities. 
    - Asperity means a region of roughness. (After polishing a
      surface well there are still /asperities/).
    - So the /real area/ of contact during rolling is the
      asperities, which is much smaller than the apparent area
      calculated by Hertz theory.
    - This results in a very high localised stress at the contact
      tips. Resulting in the breakage of asperities and
      smoothening of the surface. 

*** Microstructure of DER
    - Formation of DERs is related to the Hertzian stress
      distribution.
    - Initial formation is affected by the orientation of the
      martensite packet. 

    - Optical microscopy shows the DER as darker but cannot
      resolve any more details. 
    - Darker as there is more scattering of light which typically
      means that the region is rougher.
    - This is generally due to *smaller grain sizes or multiple
      phases / more interfaces*.
    

**** Ferrite Microbands

    - Characterisation can be perfomed with SEM, focussed ion
      beam (FIB) to allow production of position specific TEM
      lamella.
    - Detection starts with /formation of ferrite microbands/.
      - Also called: slip motions, troosite/mechanical troosite,
        tempered martensite, upper bainite/microslip/deformation
        bands, needle-like structures, acicular structures and
        elongated cells.
    - Martensite decay term used when acutal product of
      microstructural alteration is unclear. 

    - Microbands extend across martensite plate boundaries.
    - They are parallel to the surface when looking at transverse
      cut.
    - Microscopic lining up must be due to the applied stress.
    - This implies their formation is caused by applied strain
      during RCF.
      - Not due to local heating effects from the release of
        strain energy.

    - Early DER shows patches of densely spaced microbands within
      an unaltered matrix.
    - Microbands are parallel to raceway on both sides of the
      symmetry plane (looking down the raceway). In the centre
      there is no preferential alignment.
    - Multivariant ferrite microbands have been seen.
    
    - Later DER: regions of homogeneous nanocrystalline ferritic
      structure can be observed.
      - Other names include polycrystal cell, cell-like
        structure, heavily deformed ferrite and globular
        ferrite.
    - Electron diffraction indicates presence of multiple grains
      with random crystal orientations.
    - Evidence suggests that 30° and 80° WEBs are composed of
      nanocrystalline ferrite. 

    - TEM shows evidence of *dislocation cell* formation in
      fatigue-damaged microstructures.
    - *Dislocation cells* can form in metals with a characteristic
      size defined by three-dimensional tangles of dislocations
      that serve as “walls” and less dense internal regions.
    - In this imaged DER grain size is relatively large compared
      to nano-poly-crysalline ferrite in WERs.
    - The residual cementite is /not fully dissolved/ within the
      80° bands.
    - There seem to be misorientations of the ferrite bands
      across cell walls.
    - Both angles of WEBs are typically longer in length than the
      austenite grains.
    - Seem to form across many prior austenite grains with no
      observable deviation. 

**** Elongated Ferrite

     **Fill in with material skipping to carbon redistribution**


**** Decomposition of retained austenite

     - Retained austenite alters the response of the material
     - It transforms to martensite during the first stress cycles
       causing an increase in the yield stress.
     - Rapid shakedown during rolling contact also causes this.
     - This *increases the dislocation density* within the
       martensite.
     - Decrease in retained austenite is at the beginning of the
       test and there is no observable difference in the imaging.

**** Dissolution/growth of residual carbides
     - Residual cementite is harder than martensite matrix so
       should resist plastic deformation.
     - But both elongated ferrite and ferrite microbands are
       observed to grow into the residual cementite causing it to
       dissolve.
     - Also soft edges to the cementite particles indicating
       cementite dissolving during contact rolling fatigue 

**** Lenticular Carbides

     - Typically formed on the side and parallel to the large
       WEBs.
     - WEB is around 50-60μm in width.
     - Lenticular carbide around 1μm.
     - Appearence of WEBs accompanied by lenticular carbides.
     - Formation and growth of lenticular carbides must be
       related to the dissolution of tempered carbides and
       residual cementite which increases the carbon content
       within the DER.
     - And the reduction of the solubility of carbon within the
       WEBs.
     - Formation of carbids is related to the partial dissolution
       of the residual cementite (it does not need full
       dissolution). 

**** Carbon redistribution 

     - Redistribution of carbon has been seen within APT.
     - Fu claimed that carbon rich regions correspond to
       cementite and other transistion carbides. 

**** Dislocation density 

     - XRD (X-ray powder diffraction) can assess the retained
       austenite content, texture formation and residual stress
       build-up after rolling contacty fatigue.
     - Dislocation density can be determined by the analysis of
       line broadening. 

**** Hardness

     - This can be seen to be dependent on where the cross
       section is taken.
     - Slight hardening seen in the cross section
     - But softening seen in the parallel section.
     

** Mechanisms

*** Jones 
    - Suggests DERs are a structural change that appears in the
      form of areas of ferrite microbands of lower hardness than
      the original martensite.
    - Hertzian stress and internal friction of the material
      originate the transformation of som e of the inflicted
      shear energy into heat.
    - Accumulation of head generated due to cyclic stressing of
      the material leads to decay of hard martensitic phase to
      the formation of the ferrite microbands.
    - Phase transformation is result of subsurface
      tempering. (Shear strain energy theory). 



**** Comments
     - Necessitation of energy to transform into heat is
       questionable.
     - Differentiation of DER from tempered martensite



*** Bush 
    - DER is stress affected zone due to the fact it is initiated
      in the region of maximum reversed orthogonal shear stress.
    - Propose augmentation of the coverage of DER is a
      consequence of the nucleation of additional transformed
      areas.
    - This is instead of a consequence of the growth of
      previously formed dark areas.
    - This is because there is a threshold stress for emergence
      of DERs.
    - Nucleation of DER is a result of yielding/plastic flow
      instead of a thermal effect.
    
    - Don't agree with heat tempering theory.
    - Propose transformation is governed by an exchange of
      material between the carbides and the matrix.
    - This is evidenced by the formation of intrusions/extrusions
      within the microstructure.
    - Intrusion is region of different microstructure within region
    - Extrusion is on the surface instead of inside. 

**** Comments
      - Compare structure of DER to tempered martensite.
      - In both cases there is a change in hardness.
      
*** Swahn 

    - DER is a mixture of
      1) ferritic phase with inhomogeneously distributed carbon
      2) residual martensite from original microstructure. 

    - Transformation mechanisms are a /result of carbon
      redistribution/ present in solution of martensite.
      - And the dissolution of carbides.

    - Propose chronological order
      1) *stress induced carbon diffusion* leads to *diffusion* of
         carbon *from martensitic lattice* towards various *defects*
         in the material *(dislocations)*
      2) Then as plastic deformation accumulates the movement of
         dislocations creates carbon rich grain boundary-type
         interfaces. 



**** Comments 
     - Seems resonable but it did not incorporate the dissolution
       of carbides.
     - Not sure about the role of carbide dissolution in DERs,
       What time scale?



*** Voskamp
    

* Questions

  - Does the deficit of residual stress in the DER region mean
    movement of dislocations to dissapate the stress in this
    region?
  - It seems like something is happening to remove the residual
    stress.
  - *Look into potential mechanisms regarding dislocation motion*.


  - What the role of carbides dissolution in the formation of
    DERs is not clear. And also the time scale at which carbide
    dissolution occurs is not clear.
