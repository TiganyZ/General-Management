* Summary
  
  - Study mobility of screw dislocation in bcc Fe with DFT.
  - Show that /increase/ of screw dislocation velocity with a given temperature range. 
  - Interaction energy between hydrogen and screw core is calculated
    at various positions around dislocation line.
  - Results put into line tension model of curved dislocation to see
    effect that H has on dislocation migration.
  - /Softening/ effect of hydrogen caused by /reduction of kink nucleation enthalpy/.
  - /Hardening/ effect of hydrogen caused by /kink trapping/.
  - Transition between softening and hardening at lower critical temperature predicted.

* Notes
  
** Introduction
   - Solute softening sometimes occurs at low temperatures.
   - Solute atoms either:
     - Pin dislocations locally, hindering motion
     - /Reduce/ Peierls barrier locally, which:
       - Promotes /kink nucleation/
       - Thus /enhances/ dislocation motion.
   - Which effect is seen depends on core structure.

   - Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE) where fracture toughness is reduced
     with a lot of hydrogen, has mechanisms such as:
     - Hydrogen enhanced decohesion
     - Supression of dislocation emission by hydrogen
     - Hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity. 
   /Which mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement is dominant under
   engineering conditions?/
   - H mechanism suggested due to:
     - Reduced flow stress
     - Increased screw dislocaton velocity with addition of H into bcc
       matrix.
   - H atoms concentrate in tensile regions.
   - If concentrated H atoms induce local slips, this causes increases in:
     - Local strain
     - Dislocation density
   - Mobility of dislocations is mediated in bcc metals by screw
     component as it has:
     - A large Peierls barrier
     - Slow migration

   - Edge dislocation strongly attracts H due to long ranged
     hydrostatic strain fields.
   - But due to already high mobility, the H atoms are more likely to /lower/
     the mobility under most conditions.
   - Mobility of the screw dislocation is mediated by the rate of
     atomic-scale kink nucleation.
   - A single H on a long screw dislocation segment can affect the
     /nucleation rate/ by lowering the /nucleation energy/.
     - This can explain friction measurements in iron. 
    
    
   - Two different configurations of dislocation core structrure:
     - Easy core (ECC) is most stable
     - Hard core (HCC) is metastable.
       - Larger free volume

   - Movement of a screw dislocation in any direction necessitates the
     alteration between ECC and HCC core structures.
   - This results in a large Peierls barrier.

   - As H atoms are attarcted to a free volume and lower the total
     energy, the trapping of a H atom in the HCC configuration is
     expected to be stronger than that for ECC.
   - The Peierls barrier would be /lower/ with hydrogen.


   - DFT calculations shwo that saddle point of migration path between
     two ECCs is close, but different to HCC.
   - Hard core and saddle point configuration (SPC) close to hard core energy.
  
   - Assumed here that the saddle point moves toward the HCC when a H
     atom is in its core.

   - H lowers Peierls barrier when H atom is just ahead of the screw
     dislocation in its slip plane.

   /Is average mobility of screw dislocation increased?/

   - For increased average movility at lease one H atom must always be
     close to adn ahead of a screw dislocation to promote kink-pair nucleation.
   - H atom just behind the screw disloation line can slow/stop the
     kink motion and /decrease/ dislocation mobility.

   
** DFT Calculation Details

   - VASP GGS with 350 eV cutoff
   - Relaxation tolerance 10meV/A
   - Green's Function Flexible boundary conditions with concentric hexagons.
     * Region 1 relaxed while region 2 fixed.
     * Green's Function relaxation
       + Each atom's displacement $\mathbf{u}_i$ relative to elastic
         solution is calculated
       + Large number of atoms added outside region 2, positions given
         by elastic solution.
       + Displacement fields in $\mathbf{u}_i$ in region 2 and outside
         so forces calculated by Hessian matrix $\mathbf{f}_i =
         \sum_{j \neq i} M_{ij}(\mathbf{u}_j-\mathbf{u}_i)$ are zero
       + /Minimum image convention/ applied for difference of
	 displacement to accound for periodicity of the lattice.
       + Atoms in region 1 are fixed for this step.
   - DFT and Greens function relaxation repeated until convergence.
   
   - Number of atoms in region 1 and 2 are 48 and 99 respectively.
   - Cartesian coordinates are parallel to:
     * X = $\langle \bar{2}11 \rangle$
     * Y = $\langle 0\bar{1}1 \rangle$
     * Z = $\langle 111 \rangle$
   - Z cell vector length is equal to burgers vector.
   
   - Uniform Ferromagnetic state is reproduced by GGA
   - Bulk properties calculated using 2 atom Fe cell.
     * $a = 2.833 A$

   - In dislocation simulations, initial magnetic moments are se to a
     uniform ferromagnetic state.
   - Initial magnetic moment of H is set to zero.
     * This is so it converges to the right stare regardless fo teh
       sign of the magnetic interaction between H and Fe.

   - After reference state obtained, H atom is placed at each
     tetrahedral site (t-site) near the core and the atomic
     configurations are relaxed for each case. 

   - Hydrogen solution energy:
     * $E_{s} = E_{d + H} - E_{d} - E_{H2}/2$
       + $E_{d + H}$: energy of dislocation and hydrogen. 
       + $E_{d}$: energy of reference dislocation. 
       + $E_{H2}$: energy of hydrogen molecule.

  - Why would H be likely to /lower/ the mobility of edge dislocations?
