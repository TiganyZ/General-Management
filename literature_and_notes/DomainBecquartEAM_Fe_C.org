#+TITLE: Atomistic modelling of an Fe system with a small concentration of C
#+AUTHOR: Tigany Zarrouk
#+INTERLEAVE_PDF: ../papers/DomainBecquartEAM_Fe_C.pdf

* Summary

  - Study low concentrations of C in Fe with EAM potential. 
  - Validation by:
    * Simulation of C diffusion in $\alpha$-Fe
    * Determining interaction of C with screw dislocation
    * Evolution of lattice parameter with C content. 
      
 

* Notes
  
  - Interaction of C with dislocations/substitutional atoms changes the yield stress.
  - Previous models use interatomic potentials that are insufficient to model the metal-metal interaction.
    - Furthermore no C-C interaction was included.
  - Fe-C interaction potential was constructed such that one could reproduce:
    - Experimental carbon migration energy
    - Activation volume
    - Binding energy of carbon vacancy dipole
  - Rosato did second moment tight-binding model which gave better elastic properties and agreement with experimental data.
    - bcc and fcc had second-moment and Rosato-Guillope-Legrand model.
    - No C-C interaction. 

      
  - Most of these potentials /do not/ predict the correct core structure of the screw dislocation core and the relative stability of self interstitials. 

    
  - DFT calculations in FeC ferritic system were done by Domain to determine interaction between:
    - C atoms with one vacancy
    - a C atom a self-interstitial atom (SIA)
    - C-C atoms
  - Strong interactions of C with one vacancy were found.
  - No significant interaction with self-interstitials


  
* Methods 
  
  - Calculations performed in VASP with GGA and Vanderbilt-type USPP to describe the electron-ion interaction.
    - Pseudopotentials are good as they eliminate the need to include atomic core states and the hard potentials for binding them
    - Also allow finite number of plane waves (which means that they are used all of the time?)

  Comparing Paxton to EAM we see:
  - 1 Vac. 1 Carbon --> close to DFT but /further/ away from Exp. than DB EAM
  - 1 Vac. 2 Carbon (k) --> close to DFT but /further/ away from Exp. than DB EAM
  - E Migration --> further from DFT but closer to Exp than DB EAM. 

  I don't compare the 1 Vac. 2 Carbon (j) site at it was quoted that these values are relative to the ground state (which is the k configuration of the carbon dimer - vacancy complex). If the energies were added this would give values that are much worse compared to DFT. 


  

  What about in general? How do the models fare in their description of reality?
