* Binding energy of defect clusters in the harmonic approximation

  Using the defect cluster configurations mentioned earlier, one can
  find the change in defect cluster formation free energies as a
  function of temperature by using the harmonic approximation. 
  
  To build the dynamical matrix, to obtain the vibrational free energy
  contribution, one used phonopy to generate the displacements for nearest/next-nearest
  neighbours to the defect, as the local atomic environment of atoms
  past the second-nearest shells would have hardly changed from the
  perfect lattice. From this vibrational frequencies were used to
  obtain the full free energy of bindng of the defect as a function of
  temperature. 


  It would be interesting to see how the quasi-harmonic approximation
  would change improve the accuracy of temperature/concentration
  predictions with the addition of the change in the lattice parameter
  with temperature. 

* Gamma surfaces

Energies are accurate to within 2 mJm^{-2}, comparing the energies of
points in the corners which (the zeros of energy). So surface energies
might be $\pm 2$ mJm^{-2} off which is reasonable. 

These calculations were done in tight binding with 15 layers for both
basal and prismatic. The k-points for the prismatic gamma surfaces were, and for basal they were. 
DFT comparisons are usind results of Rodney. 

The Pyramidal surface was obtained using the same 32 atom cell that
Ready used in his paper on the pyramidal gamma surface with DFT
pseudopotentials.

* Dislocation core structures


** Quadrupolar Array

*** Methodology
     In the following, we see results of dislocation relaxation. The partial differential
     displacement maps are of dislocations in their initial and final states in different initial
     positions. The burger's vector seen in these plots is the partial $1/6 [11\bar{2}0]$. The
     original dislocation, of burger's vector $1/3 [11\bar{2}0]$, should dissociate into two
     dislocations on the primatic plane, each with burger's vector $1/6 [11\bar{2}0]$. The atoms were
     relaxed until the root-mean square force acting on each atom was less than $4\times 10^{-5}$
     Ryd/Bohr.

     These relaxations can be distinguished by the different initial
     positions of the dislocation centre (elastic centre) as following
     the paper by Tarrat cite:Tarrat2009. Cell geometry was 16x16x1,
     where the unit cell was of four atoms, with $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes
     given by $[0001]$, $[\bar{1}100]$ and $1/3[11\bar{2}0]$
     respectively. 
     
     #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.5\textwidth
     [[file:Images/tarrat_hcp_core_structures.png]]

     A quadrupolar array of dislocations was created using the "S"
     arrangement of Clouet cite:Clouet2012: the cut plane of the
     dislocation dipole is aligned along the diagonal of the cell;
     dislocations of the same helicity are found on the same $x$ and
     $y$ planes. This was found to give more satisfactory results for
     Peierls barrier calculations (the "O" configuration---where the
     dipole cut plane is parallel to the x axis---resulted in the
     peierls barrier increasing with cell size, whereas the opposite
     was found for the "S" arrangement). Displacements for each of the
     dislocations were determined by solutions to the anisotropic
     elasticity equations.

     To accomodate for the plastic strain introduced with the addition of
     a dislocation dipole in the simulation cell, an elastic strain was
     applied, resulting in the tilting of the principal lattice
     vectors. 

     To satisfy periodic boundary conditions, periodic displacements
     were calculated from the superposition of displacements from a
     $30x30$ array of dislocation dipoles, with the subtraction of the
     spurious linear term due to the conditional convergence of the sum
     cite:vasilybulatov2006.
    
    

*** Discussion
     One can see that all of the dislocations have dissociated on the
     prismatic plane. But there is a difference between initial
     positions as to upon which prismatic plane they dissociate on,
     from the original. 

     None of these states have dissociated onto the proposed pyramidally spread ground state that is
     proposed by Clouet cite:Clouet2015.

     Only initial position 2 actually dissociated on a different
     prismatic plane to the others. 

     The positions of the partials are also different once each of the
     separate initial positions have been relaxed. 


     IP2 and IP3, although they are on different planes, have a very
     similar core structure to each other. They are both asymmetric
     cores. 


     IP1 has the upper partial dislocation located within an adjacent
     triangle to the left, compared to IP2 and IP3. The lower partial
     has been shifted downwards, by one triangle down and to the right,
     with respect to IP3. The core structure of IP5 is
     indistinguishable from IP1. These cores can be deemed as
     metastable, as they have a slightly higher energy than the other
     cores.


     The upper partial of IP4 has been displaced upwards by one Peierls
     valley with respect to IP3. The lower partial is in the same
     triangle as IP3. IP4 is a mirrored core. 

    
     Each of these cores are asymmetric, using the definition by Tarrat
     cite:Tarrat2009. 

     The energies for each of the dislocation cores, when relaxed to
     $1\times 10^{-5}$ Ryd/Bohr is 

      | Initial position |        E_total [Ryd] |
      |------------------+---------------|
      |                1 | -331.54658899 |
      |                2 | -331.54660063 |
      |                3 | -331.54660053 |
      |                4 | -331.54660061 |

     The dissociation distance is consistent between the different
     initial positions of the elastic centres. The distance is $\approx 4c =
     35.4$ Bohr $= 18.7 \AA$, this is double the distance seen in
     Ghazisaedi and Trinkle cite:Ghazisaeidi2012 and double the
     distance that is found in the DFT Zr results by Clouet
     cite:Clouet2012.

     # There is a small energy difference between the dip in the
     # prismatic gamma surface along the $1/3 [11\bar{2}0]$
     # direction. This means that along that direction, due to the small
     # relative energy barrier between the trough in the centre of the
     # gamma surface line and the peaks, so to speak, the dislocation
     # can dissociate easily along this direction. 



*** DONE Dissociation Distance Analysis
    Following cite:Clouet2012, one can dislocation elasticity theory to
    compute the dissociation distance of a dislocation in both the
    basal and prism planes.  The energy variation caused by a
    dissociation length $d$ is
   
    \[ \Delta E_{\text{diss}}(d) = - b_i^{(1)}K_{ij}b_j^{(2)}\ln \big( \frac{d}{r_c}
    \big) + \gamma d,  \]

    where $\mathbf{b}^{(i)}$ are the burger's vectors of the dissociated
    dislocations.  $\gamma$ is the corresponding gamma surface energy and
    $K$ is the Stroh matrix. Controlling the dislocation core radius
    and the dislocation elastic energy, one can find the equilibrium
    dissociation distance as 

    \[
    d^{\text{eq}} = \frac{ b_i^{(1)}K_{ij}b_j^{(2) }}{\gamma}
    \]


    With the orientation of the simulation cell as, $U_1 = na \frac{1}{2} [10\bar{1}0]$, $U_2 = mc [0001]$, 
     $U_3 =  a \frac{1}{3} [1\bar{2}10]$, one finds the components of
     the Stroh matrix as:

     \begin{align}
     &K_{11} =& &\frac{1}{2\pi} \big( \bar{C}_{11} + C_{13} \big)
           \sqrt{ \frac{ C_{44} \big( \bar{C}_{11} - C_{13} \big)  }{
	           C_{33} \big( \bar{C}_{11} + C_{13} + 2C_{44} \big)  } 
		}
     \\    
     &K_{22 }=& &\sqrt{ \frac{ C_{33} }{ C_{11} }  } K_{11}
     \\
     &K_{33} =& &\frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{ \frac{1}{2} C_{44} \big( C_{11} - C_{12} \big)  }_{}
     \end{align}

     here, $\bar{C}_{11} = \sqrt{ C_{11}C_{33} }$.


     From the gamma surface, for the basal plane one expects a
     dissociation of $1/3[1\bar{2}10] = 1/3[1\bar{1}00] +
     1/3[0\bar{1}10]$. Then dissociation length in the basal plane is
     given by 

     \[
     d_{\text{b}}^{\text{eq}} = \frac{ ( 3K_{33} - K_{11} ) a^2 }{ 12 \gamma_{\text{b}} } 
     \]

     For the prism plane the $1/3[1\bar{2}10]$ dislocation can
     dissociate into $1/6[1\bar{2}10] \pm \alpha(c/a)[0001]$ where the
     parameter $\alpha$ controls the position of the stacking fault minimum
     along the [0001] direction. Only in interatomic potentials like
     the EAM, do we find that $\alpha = 0.14$. 

     The dissociation length is 

     \[
     d_{\text{p}}^{\text{eq}} = \frac{ ( K_{33}a^2 - 4 \alpha^2 K_{22} c^2 ) }{ 4 \gamma_{p} }
     \]

     to the differential displacement maps...
    
     Further scrutiny is necessary. 

*** TODO Disregistry Analysis
     Look into the theory of dissociation distance in Clouet paper
     cite:Clouet2012


     Disregistry given by the Peierls-Nabarro model. Analytic
     expression given in Hirth and Lothe cite:anderson2017theory.

     Disregistry $D(x)$ is defined as the displacement difference
     between the atoms in the plane just above and those just below the
     dislocation glide plane. The derivative of this function $\rho(x) = \partial
     D / \partial x$ corresponds to the dislocation density.
    

     \[
     D_{\text{dislo}} = \frac{b}{2\pi} 
     \Bigg\{ \arctan \bigg[  \frac{x - x_0 - d/2}{ \zeta } \bigg] +
            \arctan \bigg[  \frac{x - x_0 + d/2}{ \zeta } + \frac{\pi}{2} \bigg]
	    \Bigg\}
     \]

     Given $x_0$ is the dislocation position, $d$ is dissociation
     length and $\zeta$ is the spreading of each partial dislocation. 
    
     \begin{align*}
       D_{L} &= &\sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}  &D_{\text{dislo}} (x - nL) \\
          &= &\frac{ b }{ 2\pi } 
             \Bigg \{ 
              &\arctan \bigg[ 
                 \frac{ 
                       \tan \big( \frac{\pi}{L} [x - x_0 - d/2] \big)
                      }{ 
                      \tanh \big( \frac{\pi\zeta}{L} \big)
                       } \bigg]
            + \pi\bigg\lfloor 
       	      \frac{x - x_0 - d/2}{ \zeta } + \frac{1}{2}
       	    \bigg\rfloor \\
	& &+
              &\arctan \bigg[ 
                 \frac{ 
                       \tan \big( \frac{\pi}{L} [x - x_0 + d/2] \big)
                      }{ 
                      \tanh \big( \frac{\pi\zeta}{L} \big)
                       } \bigg]
            + \pi \bigg\lfloor 
       	      \frac{x - x_0 + d/2}{ \zeta } + \frac{1}{2}
       	    \bigg\rfloor    \Bigg\},
     \end{align*}

     where $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ is the floor function. 

     For an array of dislocations in the S arrangement, $D(x) = D_L(x)$,
     with $L = mc$, where $m$ is the number of repeated unit cells in
     the $U_2$ direction. 

     Here, $U_1 = na \frac{1}{2} [10\bar{1}0]$, $U_2 = mc [0001]$, 
     $U_3 =  a \frac{1}{3} [1\bar{2}10]$.

     Therefore, using this, one can fit the three fitting parameters:
     the dislocation position $x_0$, the dissociation length $d$, and the
     spreading $\zeta$. This procedure allows us to determine the
     location of the dislocation center.

     From the Peierls-Nabarro model of an edge dislocation, one finds
     that the displacement in x $u_x = -\frac{b}{2\pi} \tan^{-1}
     \frac{x}{\zeta}$, where $\zeta = d/2(1-\nu)$, where the width of
     the dislocation is $2\zeta$, where the disregistry is one-half the
     maximum value at x=0.

     For a screw dislocation, one essentially replaces $\zeta$ with
     $\eta = (1-\nu)\zeta = d/2$


     For all interaction models, we find that this center lies in
     between two (0001) atomic planes. One can see in Fig. 6 of
     cite:Clouet2012 that this position corresponds to a local symmetry
     axis of the differential displacement map. This is different from
     the result obtained by Ghazisaeidi and Trinkle
     cite:Ghazisaeidi2012 in Ti where the center of the screw
     dislocation was found to lie exactly in one (0001) atomic plane.

    This will be very useful as one can see plots of the Nye tensor, so
    one can truly see where the partials are and their dislocation
    centres. 

*** Peierls Stress  

    By straining the cell of a relaxed lattice and incrementally increasing the strain, one
    can find the minimum stress necessary to move a dislocation from one
    Peierls valley to the next. 

**** Applying strain
    
     Applying strain as in cite:Chen2013. 
    
     Here we are incrementing the strain by $0.001C^{\text{rot}}$, where $C^{\text{rot}}$ is
     the transformed elastic constant necessary for transforming a
     strain into a stress from the relation $\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl}\varepsilon_{kl}$.

     The original elastic constant matrix in its untransformed state
     is:
    
     \begin{equation*}
      C =	
       \begin{bmatrix}
	171.6093 &  94.6594 &  61.2262 &   0.     &   0.      &  0.      \\
         94.6594 & 171.6093 &  61.2262 &   0.     &   0.      &  0.      \\
         61.2262 &  61.2262 & 198.9006 &   0.     &   0.      &  0.      \\
          0.     &   0.     &   0.     &  47.4255 &   0.      &  0.      \\
          0.     &   0.     &   0.     &   0.     &  47.4255  &  0.      \\
          0.     &   0.     &   0.     &   0.     &   0.      & 38.4749  
       \end{bmatrix}
     \end{equation*}

     Transforming it into the dislocation coordinate system, by the
     rotation

     \begin{equation*}
      R =	
       \begin{bmatrix}
         1 & 0 & 0 \\
         0 & 0 & -1 \\
         0 & 1 & 0 \\
       \end{bmatrix}
     \end{equation*}


     \begin{equation*}
      C^{\text{rot}}=	
       \begin{bmatrix}
	171.6093 &  61.2262 &  94.6594 &   0.     &   0.      &  0.      \\
         61.2262 & 198.9006 &  61.2262 &   0.     &   0.      &  0.      \\
         94.6594 &  61.2262 & 171.6093 &   0.     &   0.      &  0.      \\
          0.     &   0.     &   0.     &  47.4255 &   0.      &  0.      \\
          0.     &   0.     &   0.     &   0.     &  38.4749  &  0.      \\
          0.     &   0.     &   0.     &   0.     &   0.      & 47.4255  
       \end{bmatrix}
     \end{equation*}

    

     For finding the Peierls stress to move partials away from each
     other on the prismatic plane plane one finds that the stress if
     given by $\sigma_{xy} = \sigma_{12} =  2C_{66}^{\text{rot}}\varepsilon_{12}$, where $C_{66}^{\text{rot}} =
     47.4255$ GPa.

     To move the whole dislocation on the prismatic plane, one needs a
     stress applied which is $\sigma_xz = \sigma_{13} = 2C_{55}^{\text{rot}}\varepsilon_{13}$, $C_{55}^{\text{rot}} =
     38.4749$ GPa.

     To move the dislocation onto the basal plane one needs to apply as
     stress given by $\sigma_yz = \sigma_{23} = 2C_{44}^{\text{rot}}\varepsilon_{23}$, $C_{44}^{\text{rot}} =
     47.4255$ GPa.



**** xz Strain
    
     Applying an xz strain to the lattice causes the dislocation to
     move along the prismatic plane. 

     Using an increment in the strain of $1\times 10^{-4}C^{*}$, where $C^{*}$ is
     the transformed elastic constant, with a value of $C_{44}^{*}=38.4749$
     GPa, we find that the dislocation moves from one Peierls
     valley along the prismatic plane at $0.0012C_{44}^{*}$, giving a Peierls
     stress of $\sigma_xz = 2C_{44}\varepsilon_{xz} = 0.0923$ GPa

**** yz Strain

     This is the strain necessary for movement on the basal
     plane. Following the procedure above, one does not obtain
     recombination of partials, or any movement of the dislocation onto
     the basal plane. 

     Increasing the accumulated strain up to 10\%, still in steps of
     0.001C to see if there is any difference. 

     Furthermore, one is starting from initial anisotropic elasticity
     solutions, applying strain and then relaxing, such that one may be
     able to find a strain where the screw dislocation has spread in
     the basal plane.

    
**** xy strain 

     An xy strain can move the partials of the prismatic plane apart. 

     One can find the Peierls stress for these single partials to move
     in opposite directions.
    
     Here the \alpha parameter is 0.03. 

     This means that the stress necessary to move the partial
     dislocations apart is 

     \begin{align*}
     \sigma_{12} &= C_{1212}\varepsilon_{12} \\
         &= 2C^{\text{Voigt}}_{66 }\varepsilon_6^{\text{Voigt}} \\
         &= ( C_{11}- C_{12}) \varepsilon_6^{\text{Voigt}} \\
         &= 47.4255 \times 0.03 \\ 
         &= 1.42 GPa\ 
     \end{align*}

     The strain is applied to the whole cell, as the dislocation cell
     is periodic, then the stress upon each partial is the same.

     [[file:Images/final_model_peierls_xy_0.03_final_partials.png]]


**** Pyramidal Strain

     For a strain to transform the dislocation into the metastable,
     pyramidal state, one can apply a strain which applies shear to the
     dislocation whereby the maximum resolved shear stress is on the
     first-order pyramidal plane. 

     In the coordinate system of the dislocation, one can estimate the strain necessary by the ratio
     of stresses for the basal and prismatic planes. The proportions strains $\sigma_{xz}$ and
     $\sigma_{yz}$ should be $c/a : \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 1.83 : 1 \approx 1 : 0.54683$.
    
     Unfortunately, this proportion does not work, nor does the ratio $\sigma_{xz}:\sigma_{yz}$
     \approx 1: 1/10$. A much, much lower proportion of the strain is
     necessary as the dislocation just moves prismatically. Once one finds
     the Peierls stress for the basal plane, we can estimate a more realistic proportion.

** Cluster Method
   
*** Methodology

    This secton comprises the results of using the cluster method to
    simulate single dislocations in the Ti model. 
    
    The cluster method simulates dislocations by only imposing periodicity in the direction of the
    dislocation line (the z-axis, in this case). This the advantage over dislocation dipole
    simulations as there are no dislocation-dislocation interactions which interfere with
    relaxation, but in their stead, there are dislocation-boundary interactions, which inhibit the
    relaxation of the dislocation core.

    As the number of atoms in a cluster increases, the resulting core
    structure upon relaxation will tend to the bulk core structure, as
    there is a reduction in the spurious dislocation-surface
    interaction. Due to the finite size of simulations, the geometry
    of the cell is important. With sufficient cell size, dislocation
    core structure should be invariant to the boundary conditions
    imposed. To ascertain how sensitive the new Ti model is to
    boundary conditions, two different cell geometries were used:
    circular and hexagonal. Each of these had two layers of fixed
    (inert) atoms around a dynamic central region.

    All relaxations were carried out using the Fletcher-Powell
    conjugate gradient algorithm with a force twolerance of $4\times
    10^{-5}$ Ryd/Bohr $\approx 1\times 10^{-3} \text{eV}/\AA$, with a
    k-point mesh of 1x1x30. 

    Tarrat cite:Tarrat2009 deemed that the use of hexagonal cluster
    cell geometries were more beneficial to determine the core
    structure of dislocations due to a lower total surface energy,
    implying a reduction in the magnitude of dislocation-surface
    interaction. 



    # Upon relaxation of a circular and a hexagonal cell, of 936 and
    # 1082 atoms respectively, the time for the dynamic region of the
    # core of the dislocation to relax was approximately 1.5 times that of
    # using a circular ($\approx$ 43500 seconds to $\approx$ 28800). The
    # number of steps for the relaxation algorithm to reach tolerance
    # was one less for the hexagonal cell, to the circular cell (195 to
    # 196 steps). Given the cubic scaling of direct-diagonalisation
    # tight-binding, one would expect that the increase in time for
    # these to cells to be $(1082/936)^3\approx 1.5$, which is exactly
    # what is seen.

*** Peierls Stress

**** yz strain (basal transformation)

     In the cluster method, by incrementally increasing the strain in
     increments of 0.001, one found at 0.035 in the IP4 configuration, that
     the bottom partial dislocation suddenly splits away from the
     prismatic plane the dislocation was spread on.

     The dislocations are then of basal character (the partial left on
     the prismatic plane being $1/3\langle 0 \bar{1} 1 0\rangle$, with
     the other partial being $1/3\langle 1 \bar{1} 0 0\rangle$).

     This lower partial moved to the right by 6 lattice parameters and down by
     1 clat. There is an I2 (fcc) stacking fault which separates the
     prismatic plane from the partial. The core structure is only
     basally spread upon movement. 
     The other partial moves down the prismatic plane to join the
     stacking fault to join in a more compact, yet still basally
     dissociated dislocation. The resultant displacements from the
     prismatic spreading are removed. 

     Then after moving across by 1 alat and up 2 clat, the two
     partials stay dissociated on the basal plane, being separated by
     4 alat at a maximum. The fcc stacking fault is subsequently
     removed by recombination of the dislocations into a compact
     $1/3\langle 1 \bar{2} 1 0 \rangle$ core. This core then begins to
     spread in two adjacent prismatic planes with a pyramidal core
     spreading joining the two.

     The spreading changes from pyramidal with prismatic on two
     different prismatic planes, to purely prismatic on the
     rightmost prismatic plane. Whereupon, after moving upwards, the
     dislocation spreads in this plane identically to the spreading of
     an IP4 core configuration upon relaxation.


     This means that the Peierls stress for the basal plane, in the
     case of a cluster calculation is $\sigma_{yz} = \sigma_{23} =
     2C_{44}^{\text{rot}}\varepsilon_{23}$, with $\varepsilon =
     0.035$, and  $C_{44}^{\text{rot}} = 47.4255$ GPa, we get
     $\sigma_{yz}^{\text{crit.}} = 0.035  \times  47.4255 \approx 1.66$ GPa.

*** Discussion
    
    The boundary conditions of the cell seem to be quite important in determining the core
    structure. There are differences between the core structure of some of the initial positions
    between the hexagonal and cylindrical cells. 

    IP1, IP2 and IP5 dislocation centres result in the same core configuration regardless of
    the geometry of the cell.

* Binding of oxygen to dislocations
  
** Quadrupolar Array
   
   Using a relaxed $12\times 12$ slab with an "S" quadrupolar
   arrangement of dislocations, of which the elastic centres of each
   are in initial position 5, one can repeat this cell three times in
   the $z$-direction. One can place oxygen in octahedral sites near
   the dislocation core in the middle layer at varying distances from
   the core. By repeating this, one can ascertain how the binding
   energy of oxygen to dislocations changes with distance from the
   core. 

   One does not expect a lot of interaction from the dislocation core
   beyond a few burgers vectors of distance of the solute from the
   core, as the core field decays rapidly. Beyone this, one would
   expect resulting in a lot of the binding energy to come from the
   interaction of the strain fields generated by the oxygen
   interstitial deforming an octahedral site and the strain field of
   the dislocation itself. 


   Oxygen was placed near both cores in the simulation cell, such that
   the quadrupolar array was more stable. 
   
   Oxygen in the closest octahedral sites in the same basal plane of
   the dislocation, unsurprisingly, produced the most change from the
   initial dislocation position. Interestingly, it seems that due to
   the distortion of the octahedral site from the interstitial oxygen,
   the shear stress field produces is above the Peierls stress
   necessary for the dislocation to glide on the prismatic plane. This
   results in the quadrupolar cores moving to form an S configuration
   of an opposite type.

** Notes
  
  A strategy to find the binding energies of different interstitial
  sites. 

  1) Find cores of the dislocation using my in-house differential
     displacement map analysis.
  2) Identify octahedral sites near the cores.
  3) Translate octahedral sites from the perfect lattice to the
     lattice with a dislocation by the average displacement of the six
     surrounding lattice sites.
  4) Put the solute into a given interstitial site such that upon
     application of the transformation of lattice from one
     dislocation core to another (upon rotation and reflection), the
     interstitial is in an equivalent position. (If one were to look
     at each dislocation in with the burgers vector pointing into the
     page, the site should be equivalent.)
  5) Relax and find the binding energy by calculating the difference
     in energy from the relaxed dislocation to the unrelaxed. 

     
** Dissolution Energy Equation
   
   The binding energy of oxygen to a dislocation can be given by the
   following equation:

   \[ E^{\text{sol}}_{\text{O-disl.}} = E_{\text{disl} + n\text{O}} -
   E_{\text{disl}} - \frac{n}{2} E_{\text{O}_2}   \]

** Current status of simulation
   
   An S-arrangement of dislocation dipoles what created in a 12x12
   supercell of 576 atoms oriented such that the $1/3[11\bar{2}0]$
   direction was parallel to the z axis. The dislocation cores were in
   the initial position 5 (IP5) and relaxed.

   The cell was augmented by two extra periodic images in the
   z-direction, creating a 12x12x3 cell of 1728 atoms. 

   Oxygen was put into octahedral sites in increasing distance
   from each of the cores. The distance was up to four octahedral sites
   from the core along the prismatic plane and four prismatic planes
   along. This gives 16 sites from which one can extract the
   dependence of the dislocation binding energy with distance from the
   dislocation core.

   These will provide references for the embedding calculations. It is
   hoped that embedding will give more accurate answers due to:
   1. There only being one dislocation in an embedding cell:
      - Dislocation strain fields are long-ranged, therefore one can
        expect errors due the the additional dislocation-dislocation
        interaction upon relaxation. 


   Unfortunately, it was seen with the addition of oxygen to both
   cores that the dipole configuration became unstable. Furthermore,
   the effective shear stress applied when an oxygen was near the
   dislocation core was enough to cause the dislocation to move on the
   prismatic plane. 

   
	


  # 1) Octahedral sites near the dislocation core

  #      sites?
  #    - Shall one build the perfect lattice and then move the site
  #      into the relaxed octahedral one. 
  #    - Find non-equivalent sites near the core
  #    - Find the average dislplacement going from the perfect site to
  #      the relaxed cell with dislocation
  #    - Displace octahedral site by the average of the displacement of
  #      the octahedral sites. 
       
  # 2) Relax the relaxed dislocation and the binding sites such that one
  #    can find the solution energy. 

  # 3) Make perfect lattice, then find displacement from relaxed. Find
  #    all octahedral sites near a particular dislocation core and then

* Peierls Barriers

  One can calculate the Peierls barrier to dislocation motion on
  particular planes by preparing two relaxed simulation cells, with
  the dislocation cores translated with respect to each other on the
  plane of interest. 

  Evidence from Clouet cite:Clouet2015 suggests that such a
  dislocation core in this initial position (IP1) can undergo a
  locking and unlocking mechanism. A prismatically spread $\langle
  11\bar{2}0 \rangle$ screw core can glide along the wide prismatic
  plane with a low shear stress, due to the small Peierls barrier on
  this plane. This glissile core is metastable, allowing for
  transformation to the ground state configuration of the dislocation
  (as found by DFT) which is a sessile, pyramidally spread core on the
  first-order pyramidal plane. This is the "locking" mechanism
  (whereas unlocking is the opposite: a sessile pyramidal to glissile
  prismatic core transformation). This core can then glide on the
  pyramidal plane by transformation into a glissile pyramidally spread
  core, which has a much higher Peierls barrier (and excess energy)
  than the prismatic glissile core, resulting in an increase in
  lattice friction dislocation on the pyramidal plane compared to the
  prismatic plane.

  To calculate these Peierls barriers, first one considered the
  prismatic plane. The relaxed IP1 core is situated in a wide
  prismatic plane, which has a lower shear stress for glide activation
  than the narrow prismatic plane. The dislocation(s) of one cell were
  translated by $\frac{c}{2}$ in the $y$ direction with respect to the other
  cell and relaxed. 

  For the basal plane, one translated the dislocation(s) by
  $\frac{\sqrt{3}a}{2}$ in the $x$ direction. 

  For the pyramidal plane, one translated the dislocation by
  $[\frac{\sqrt{3}a}{2}, c]$.
