* Plan 

PLAN 

- Start with the theory of DFT with the HK theorem and KS equations to solve
  for the density.
- Talk a bit about the approximations that are made. 
- Alloy theory and the structure of Ti3Al
- Look at literature to do with all of this. Go through why solutes are
  incredibly important and why it is necessary do to this research.
- How can solutes lead to failure and why is oxygen in particular bad for the alloy.
- Is it wavy or planar slip
- Go into the calculations and what I have done for them
- Cite the research about the Fe and C vacancy concentration and what the
  implications are for alloy research
- What can I add to the research

* Introduction 

Since the discovery that quanta may accurately describe the phenomena of black body radiation,
it has been known that atoms are governed by a different physical paradigm to that of matter on
the macroscopic scale: quantum mechanics. To model the behaviour of atoms in a solid, we can
use quantum mechanics.

The first postulate of of quantum mechanics states that a quantum mechanical system can be
described by a wavefunction, a function of the positions of the quantum mechanical entities,
and time, which satisfies the Schr\:odinger equation. Bonding in materials is heavily dependent
on how electrons arrange themselves upon the assembly of atoms to make solid. By the first postulate we
would expect upon assembly, the state of a the system can be fully described by a /many body
wavefunction/: a wavefunction which is a function of the positions of each of the electrons and
nuclei in the system.

Assuming that we have non-relativistic electrons, the Schr\:odinger equation one must solve is then 

\[\Big( 
   \sum_{i} -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_{i}^{2} 
   + \frac{1}{2} \sum_i\sum_j    \frac{1}{| \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j |}
   +             \sum_i\sum_I \frac{-Z_I}{| \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{R}_I |}
\Big) \mathbf{ \Psi ) = E \mathbf{ \Psi ), \]

where we have used Hartree units ( $e = m = \hslash = 4\pi\epsilon_0 = 1$ ).
