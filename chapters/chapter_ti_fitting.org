  Fitted canonical d titanium model such that we could have a better
  description of titanium within a tight-binding framework. Empirical
  potential are not accurate enough to describe the intricacies of the
  titanium structure.

* Fitting

  The d-band model of titanium was chosen to be of a simple form
  initially, from which one could build up complexity as and when.

  The overlap integrals were chosen to have a simple exponential
  distance dependence, as initially formulated by Ducastelle,
  cite:Ducastelle1970c and Allan cite:Allan1976. This form was
  originally motivated by an approximation to the density of states,
  of which the form was taken to be a Gaussian fitted to the
  second-moment of the distribution cite:Spanjaard1984. Extensions of
  pseudopotential theory to transition metals, by incorporating d-band
  resonances, suggest a fifth-degree power law distance dependence of
  the d-orbitals for transition metal matrix elements
  cite:Heine1980,Pettifor1995,Harrison1989. However, it has not been
  shown that a power-law dependence exhibits better transerability
  over a simple exponential dependence cite:Skinner1991,Paxton2010,
  in-fact, many power-law models have not fared well in predicting
  data outside of their fitting range
  cite:Paxton1987,Paxton1989. Transferability has been consistently
  shown for the iron tight-binding model created by Paxton and
  Els√§sser cite:Paxton2010, which used an exponential
  dependence. Their model predicts data well outside of their fitting
  range: non-degenerate dislocation core structures found in the bcc
  phase cite:Simpsonb,Simpson2020, phonons and vacancy-formation
  energies. In addition, the Fe-Fe interactions have been shown
  suitable when incorporated with Fe-H/Fe-C interactions, to describe
  of hydrides and carbides cite:Paxton2010,Paxton2013.

  Canonical band theory cite:Andersen1985,Paxton2009a suggests that the bond integrals are in the
  ratio
  \[
  \label{eq:canonical_band_ratio}
  dd\sigma:  dd\pi:  dd\delta = -6:4:-1.
  \]
  These ratios are only applicable to the fifth-order power law
  dependence of the bond integrals, as there is no characteristic
  $d$-orbital radius from which to compare the ratios. It has been
  shown that non-orthogonal models of titanium, which have been
  subsequently orthogonalised to a $d$-band only model, have canonical
  ratios which deviate largely from canonical band theory; in the case
  of Urban /et al./ the ratio turned out to be $dd\sigma: dd\pi:
  dd\delta = -4.3 : 3.6 : -1$, in which the ordering of the ratio
  magnitudes changed cite:Urban2011.

  To obtain better fitting results, these ratios were allowed to vary
  from those found from canonical band theory. This is standard
  practice in other models . Non-orthogonal models
  of titanium, which have been subsequently orthogonalised to a
  $d$-band only model, have canonical ratios which deviate largely from
  canonical band theory; in the case of Urban /et al./ the ratio
  turned out to be $dd\sigma: dd\pi: dd\delta = -2.7 : 6.4 : -1$,
  in which the ordering of the ratio magnitudes changed
  cite:Urban2011. We do not allow the ratios to deviate by more than
  20% in our fitting.
  # WHY??-


  The bond integrals and pair potential ranges were chosen to start
  decaying to zero by a multiplicative polynomial between first and
  second neighbours in the hcp structure, going to zero between the
  second and third-neighbours. It was verified that the cutoffs were
  not very close to other neighbour shells in other titanium
  polymorphs, such that in future simulations, there would be no large
  and sudden forces arising from the inclusion of extra neighbours
  upon deformation. A multiplicative cutoff type was preferred over
  augmentative as it has been shown mitigate the effect of large
  second-derivatives, which would cause difficulty in replicating
  experimental elastic constants and phonon dispersion
  cite:Pashov2012.

  In fitting, it was found that having only first-neighbour
  interactions, did not give desirable properties for the hcp phase:
  elastic constants which resulted in negative Cauchy pressures and a
  poor description of the energy difference between titanium
  polymorphs. Increasing the range of the interactions to
  second-neighbours resulted in more favourable results.


  The form of the pair potential was chosen to be simple sum of two
  exponentials and a rapidly decaying power law. The exponentials,
  which have one large positive term, and a smaller negative term,
  contribute the most over the range of interaction, with the power
  law chosen to only increase the repulsion at smaller distances. The
  addition of this power law gave more desirable gamma surface
  energies more reminiscent of DFT. This will be discussed in section
  *SECTION LABEL*. The resultant pair potential was highly repulsive
  at short distances, yet became slightly
  attractive at larger distances. This allowed for one to approximately account for
  hybridisation effects in this simple $d$-orbital only model, as done
  in previous exclusively $d$-orbital tight-binding models for
  titanium cite:Girshick1998a.

* sd fitting: Including hybridisation

  We included s orbitals such that one could more readily model the
  Ti$^{4+}$ oxidation state of the Ti ion, which would give a more
  physical representation of titanium ions in quantum electrochemistry
  calculations.
