* Tasks


** TODO See how the PDOS changes with addition of oxygen and how the tetrahedral/octahedral sites change this.
** TODO Calculate solution enthalpy of oxygen in titanium. 
- The solution enthalpy $E_{\text{sol}}$ and excess volume $\Delta V$ is 
  $$ E_{\text{sol} = E( \text{Ti}_n \text{O} ) - E( \text{Ti}_n ) - E(O) $$
  $$ \Delta V = V( \text{Ti}_n \text{O} ) - V( \text{Ti}_n ) $$
- $E( \text{Ti}_n \text{O} )$ is the excess energ of the bulk supercell with n
  Ti atoms and one impurity atom. $E( \text{Ti}_n )$ is the energy of the pure
  cells.
- Influence of cell sizes and solution enthalpy needs to be considered.

** TODO Has anyone investigated the stacking faults of Omega phase?
   - Maybe as Omega phase doesn't occur that often, perhaps it has not been
     studied in detail.
   - I should look further into thsi
** TODO Finish doing the gamma surfaces for all planes for pure titanium. 
*** Checking the convergence criteria
      - Now checking the convergence criteria.

**** How the lattice parameters change with the fineness of the k mesh
     - Maybe with a less fine k mesh the lattice parameters become
       worse. 
     - SOLUTION: The lattice parameters do not change that much under
     differences with the k mesh. [[file:~/Documents/disl_gsurf/hcp_pris_screw/hcp_relaxed_pris_screw/gamma_surfaces/get_hom_shear_bc_gs.py::lattice_parameters_vs_k_mesh(%20tbe_command,%20minimiserf%3D'Nelder-Mead',%20plot%3DTrue,%20data%3Ddata)][File with change of the lattice

***** What if rmaxh is smaller or larger?
      - If rmaxh is is smaller (say rmaxh = 6.7 bohr) then we get the same
        results.

      - If rmaxh is larger ( rmaxh = 20 bohr ), all possible interactions must
        be included then. And so we get the same results.

**** How does rmaxh change the lattice parameters?

***** How does rmaxh change the energy of a supercell
      - How does the number of neighbours change and what is the relation
	between rmaxh and larger cell sizes.
*** Notes on the model.
    It seems that there is a lot of charge moving around when doing the
    relaxations. 
    I think that this may be due to the fact that there is no Hubbard U
    interactions, a parameter for the coulomb interaction, which stops the
    charges from moving freely.

** TODO Gamma lines for bop 
Seems that the gamma lines for bop are not symmetric at the moment 

[[file:Images/gamma_line_bop_2019-03-14.png]]

One can see that it is not perfectly symmetric upon relaxation. This could be
due to the lack of periodic boundaries. One must investigate why the number of
neighbours is so high when it is periodic.

** Investigate why rmaxh changes energy
   - Variation of rmaxh does not change the energy
   - Obviously the number of neighbours changes with rmaxh.
   - Conclusion: rmaxh only determines what atoms are its neighbours. 
   - This is the file which investigates this:
     [[file:~/Documents/ti/complete_titanium/ti_01-11-18/mod_rmaxh/check_rmaxh_energy_neighbours.py][check_rmaxh_energy_number_neighbours]]

    - Without changing anything, the total energy of hcp in Tony's newest
      model is $E_{\text{tot hcp}} = -0.57230068 \text{Ryd}$
    - I thought perhaps that the lattice parameters and the elastic constants
      that way might produce a different result.
    - Minimising the lattice parameters gives an energy of  $E_{\text{tot
      hcp}} = -0.572351 \text{Ryd}$ with lattice parameters of
     $a_{\text{hcp}} = 5.4908 \text{bohr}$, $c_{\text{hcp}} = 8.8353 \text{bohr}$ giving $c/a_{\text{hcp}} = 1.6091 \text{bohr}$
    - Elastic constants, in GPa are \[ C_{11}=185.4, C_{33}=191.8, C_{44}= 39.7, C_{12}= 56.5, C_{13}= 56.1\]

  - The calculation only depends of periodicity perpendicular to the plane
    that one wants the stacking fault on.
  - This means that one can have a stacking that is probably ABCD or something

*** Clouet vs Cai S and O configuration
Using an array like this

[[file:Images/prismatic_quadrupole_wrong.png][Dipole to make quadrupolar array: before]]


Gives a variation of sx and sy, the vector that corrects for the spurious
linear term in the periodic solution like
[[file:Images/variation_of_sx_sy.png][Variation of sx and sy]] which should be approximately constant over the whole
of the cell. 

Makes cell like this 
[[file:Images/quadrupole_dislocations_periodic_wrong.png][Dipole to make quadrupolar array: after]]


With higher truncation limit for z we have:

[[file:Images/variationofsxsyhighertrunc.png][Variation of sx and sy with higher truncation (5,30)]]

Have come to the conclusion that Bulatov and Cai's work is reproducible, but
the statement by Emmanuel Clouet, that he took into effect the periodicity of
the lattice, seems dubious, at least from the standpoint of a periodic
displacement field. 

This is because, in Cai's work, one finds a linear correction 
$\mathbf{s}\cdot\mathbf{r}$ to the displacement modified by the periodic
images, $u_{\text{sum}}$.
When the dislocation dipole is in the same glide plane, as in Cai's work, 
the linear correction vector $\mathbf{s}$ (this is a tensor in general but it is just a
vector for one component of the displacement field), should be a constant. And
it is indeed a constant that varies only slightly depending on where one
measures it. 

Following the S or the O configuration like Clouet, one finds that there are
/distinct/ solutions for this $\mathbf{s}$ correction term depending the
position of measurement: there is one solution on the outer edges of the cut
planes and then another distinct solution inside. 

If one goes through and adds in the contribution from periodic dipoles one
does not find a periodic field, and even more troubling, is the fact that
atoms are displaced by a very large amount from the original position in the
unit cell ($\approx 100$ a.u.).

**** Prismatic quadrupole cell size 12 x 12 x 1
***** Intro
Following the prescription set out by Tarrat, Clouet and Cai, one made a
supercell that is in the S configuration with a dislocation dipole that obeys
periodic displacements with an additional strain applied to the cell such that
the plastic strain that is introduced into the cell from the dislocation
dipole is cancelled. 
***** Results
With this cell size one found that there was weird behaviour with the
dislocations. 
This cell used 576 atoms. Upon relaxation, it seemed that the dislocations
were attracted to each other. One of the dislocations, only the one in the
lower left quadrant, dissociated into three partials:
- a $1/3[ 1 -1 0 0 ]$ dislocation which
  had it's core, according to ovito, displaced from the original position by
  roughly c/2 downwards and 2a to the right
- a $1/18[-4 0 4 3]$ dislocation which was situated approximately c/2 down and
  1/2a to the left
- and a $1/18[4 -6 2 -3]$ partial situated c upwards and 1/2a across.
***** Discussion
It seems that a larger cell size is necessary, even though in Clouet they used
cell sizes of 100 and 256 atoms in the S configuration. 

This implies that simply something is wrong with the implementation. 

The cell really is periodic in displacement so that should not be an issue. 

The model is certainly not perfect with the elastic constants being quite
wrong. 

The addition of strain to the lattice follows the paper by Clouet. 
Perhaps a calculation by hand is necessary for validation of this methods. 

The dislocation displacements are calculated using anisotropic elasticty
theory, perhaps the transformation that is being used to transform from the
Cartesian coordinate system of the elastic constants to that of the
dislocation reference frame is not perfect. 

***** TODO Check the transformation of the elastic constants is correct

***** TODO Validate the formula used to add strain to the lattice vectors 

***** TODO Find out what is the interaction energy of these dislocations and see if this has a bearing on the simulation

Omega is found in both trigonal and perfect (hexagonal) forms. 
#
Positions are:
A: 0. 0. 0. 
B: 2/3 1/3 (1/2-z); 1/3 2/3 (1/2+z)

Where z = 1/6 is cubic symmetry. 

The two atomic sites in the omega unit cell are not equivalent.  B-type atomic
sites are more closely packed as compare to the A-type atomic site.
