* Statement of the Problem 

* Introduction: Literature Review
** Summary of Thesis

* Simulation Methodology
** Tight-binding
** Fitting
** Remarks on tight-binding
   - Love it / Loathe it
   - Remark how with tight-binding we can see the different
     contributions to the total energy.
   - P. W. Anderson's theory on tight-binding. Dismissing it
     initially, but it's the right way to think about solids

* Dislocations in pure metals
** Fe 
   - Comparison of the 
     - sd, non-orthogonal tight-binding models.
     - d-canonical model
** Ti       
   - Tiny difference of 0.53 eV which determines the difference
     between each of the core energies.
   - Planar faults 
     - Compare to DFT literature of Rodney, Curtin and Tarrat
     - Compare to other TB models
       - ICAMS model is rubbish!

* Oxygen in Ti
  - Defect clusters and binding of oxygen to dislocations if possible 
  - TB >> DFT!
    - Because we can decompose the total energy into contributions
    - Look at how tight-binding allows us to see the physics by
      breaking down the total energy.
       

* C in Fe
  - SKF report 
  - Onwards to kMC

* Wish-list
  - Line tension models maybe?
