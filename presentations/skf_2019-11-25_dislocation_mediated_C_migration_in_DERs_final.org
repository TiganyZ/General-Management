* Motivation 
  # - Rolling contact on bearing raceways generate maximal shear
  #   stresses in subsurface.
  # - Degradation in subsurface microstructure observed.
  # - This can lead to failure by Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF).
  # - Subsurface degradation of bearing raceways arises in form of Dark
  #   Etching Regions (DERs).
  # - DERs characterised by development of ferrite and carbide features with
  #   patches of unaltered martensitic matrix.
  - Carbon redistribution and plastic deformation are thought to be
    fundamental mechanisms behind DER formation.
  - Differing mechanisms of dislocation-driven carbon migration have
    been suggested, but no consensus.
  - Atomistic modelling necessary to elucidate how dislocations could
    move carbon; thus clarifying potential mechanisms of DER formation. 

# ** DER Mechanisms
   
#    - Theories of carbon redistribution causing DERs come from several
#      observations:
#      - Ferrite formation
#      - Lenticular carbide formation
#      - Dissolution of residual carbides.
#      - Difference in C concentration from original martensite to DER. 
#    - Dislocations can attract carbon and form Cottrell atmospheres.
#    - Current theories suggest with dislocation glide, carbon
#      migration is assisted.
#    # - Growth of lenticular carbides is linked to formation of DER through
#    #   mechanical diffusion by dislocations and thermal diffusion.
#    - Debate as to whether carbon is deposited in temper carbides,
#      causing them to grow, or if there is dissolution of temper
#      carbides.


# ** New DER Mechanism proposal

#    - Dislocation pile-ups could cause attract carbon from temper/residual
#      carbides causing their dissolution.
#    - Dislocation rearrangement into cell structures from cyclic
#      stresses and dislocation-carbon interaction.
#    - Large plastic strains in region will form ferrite microbands and
#      nanocrystalline ferrite with as the number of stress cycles
#      increases.
#    - Expelled C from ferrite microbands and nanocrystalline ferrite
#      forms lenticular carbides.
#    - Carbon diffusion assisted by pipe diffusion along dislocation. 

* Aims
  To answer the questions:
  - Do dislocations assist carbon migration?
  - How are dislocations influenced by carbon on atomistic scale?
    - How does carbon affect kink-pair nucleation/migration?
    - How fast do the dislocations move in carbon environemnt?
    - What dislocation structures are found with dislocation movement? 
  - Do temper carbides dissolve/grow with rolling contact fatigue?
    - Is is more energetically favourable for a carbon to be in a
      Cottrell atmosphere or in a carbon rich grain boundary?
    # - We want to determine how these dislocations influence the
    #   movement of C:
    #   - Does C actually move with the dislocation?
    #   - Are dislocations pinned and then unpinned with stress?
    #   - How does stress actually change C diffusion rates, are they
    # 	comparable to dislocation velocities?

* Methods
  - Tight-binding simulations to determine influence of carbon on
    dislocations.
  - Line tension model of dislocation to acquire stress-dependent
    kink-pair formation energies.
  - Kinetic Monte Carlo model of dislocations in carbon environment.

* Kinetic Monte Carlo


#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:right; width: 50%">

- kMC simulations model the movement of dislocations on much larger
  timescales than atomistics.
- Propogation of dislocation line segments are treated as rare events
  with particular rates and mechanisms depending on local environment.
- Rates for each of the mechanism are derived from atomistic
  calculations.
- One can find dislocation velocity as a function of stress and
  temperature.

* Tight Binding


#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 50%">

- Tight binding is an approximation to DFT.
- Overlaps between atomic orbitals are key parameters.
- Parameters can be fitted to experimental data.
- $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$, but much smaller prefactor compared to DFT.

  - Build kinetic Monte-Carlo (kMC) model of dislocation motion. 
  - Atomistic (tight-binding) simulations used to obtain formation
    energies necessary for kMC:
    1) Kink-pair formation energies as a function of carbon content
       and stress.
    2) Dissolution energies of carbon near core of dislocation as a
       function of stress.
  - kMC model used to see larger scale movement of screw dislocation
    by kink-pair formation, in environment of C. 
  #+REVEAL_HTML: </div>  
*  Plan



  1) C/defect solution energies
     1. In perfect lattice
     2. With dislocation
  2) Dislocation core reconstruction with C
  3) Kink-pair formation energies
     1. Without C
     2. With C in different interstitial sites
     3. Under stress
  4) kMC transition rates 
  5) kMC screw dislocation propagation in C environment

* Summary
  - Dislocation-assisted carbon migration thought to be fundamental
    mechanism behind DER formation.
  - No consensus on which mechanism is correct, if it is at all the case. 
  - Simulations can give insight into how dislocations interact with
    carbon, thus elucidating potential mechanism.
  - A combination of atomistic and kinetic monte-carlo simulations can
    be used to accurately model the behaviour of dislocations in an
    environment of carbon.
