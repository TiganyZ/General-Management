* Motivation 
  # - Rolling contact on bearing raceways generate maximal shear
  #   stresses in subsurface.
  # - Degradation in subsurface microstructure observed.
  # - This can lead to failure by Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF).
  # - Subsurface degradation of bearing raceways arises in form of Dark
  #   Etching Regions (DERs).
  # - DERs characterised by development of ferrite and carbide features with
  #   patches of unaltered martensitic matrix.
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 50%">
  - Carbon redistribution and plastic deformation are thought to be
    fundamental mechanisms behind DER formation.
  - Differing mechanisms of dislocation-driven carbon migration have
    been suggested, but no consensus.
  - Atomistic modelling necessary to elucidate if/how dislocations could
    move carbon; thus clarifying potential mechanisms of DER
    formation.

# ** DER Mechanisms
   
#    - Theories of carbon redistribution causing DERs come from several
#      observations:
#      - Ferrite formation
#      - Lenticular carbide formation
#      - Dissolution of residual carbides.
#      - Difference in C concentration from original martensite to DER. 
#    - Dislocations can attract carbon and form Cottrell atmospheres.
#    - Current theories suggest with dislocation glide, carbon
#      migration is assisted.
#    # - Growth of lenticular carbides is linked to formation of DER through
#    #   mechanical diffusion by dislocations and thermal diffusion.
#    - Debate as to whether carbon is deposited in temper carbides,
#      causing them to grow, or if there is dissolution of temper
#      carbides.


# ** New DER Mechanism proposal

#    - Dislocation pile-ups could cause attract carbon from temper/residual
#      carbides causing their dissolution.
#    - Dislocation rearrangement into cell structures from cyclic
#      stresses and dislocation-carbon interaction.
#    - Large plastic strains in region will form ferrite microbands and
#      nanocrystalline ferrite with as the number of stress cycles
#      increases.
#    - Expelled C from ferrite microbands and nanocrystalline ferrite
#      forms lenticular carbides.
#    - Carbon diffusion assisted by pipe diffusion along dislocation. 

* Aims
  To answer the questions:
  - How can dislocations assist carbon migration?
  - How are dislocations influenced by carbon on atomistic scale?
    - How does carbon affect kink-pair nucleation/migration?
    - How fast do the dislocations move in carbon environment?
  #   - What dislocation structures are found with dislocation movement? 

  # - Can trapped carbon in core provide precipitation sites for
  #   carbides? 
  # - Do temper carbides dissolve/grow with rolling contact fatigue?
  #   - Is is more energetically favourable for a carbon to be in a
  #     Cottrell atmosphere or in a carbon rich grain boundary?
    # - We want to determine how these dislocations influence the
    #   movement of C:
    #   - Does C actually move with the dislocation?
    #   - Are dislocations pinned and then unpinned with stress?
    #   - How does stress actually change C diffusion rates, are they
    # 	comparable to dislocation velocities?

* Methods

** Tight Binding


#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 50%">

- Tight binding is an approximation to DFT.
- Overlaps between atomic orbitals are key parameters.
- Parameters can be fitted to experimental data.
- $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$, but much smaller prefactor compared to DFT.
- Fe/Fe-C carbon model developed by Paxton and Elsässer (Phys. Rev. B,
  2013).
- One can find the C-dislocation binding energies, Peierls barriers
  and line tension constants.

#+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

** Line Tension Model


 - Line tension model approximates energy of dislocation line as a
   function of core position. 
 - Composed of quantities derived from atomistics /e.g./:
   - Peierls barrier, $E_{\text{P}}(\mathbf{P}_j)$
   - Carbon-dislocation interaction energy, $E_{\text{C}}(\mathbf{P}_j)$,
   - Line tension constant, $K$.   

 - Defined from Itakura /et al./, (Acta Materialia, 2013) as

   # $E^{\text{LT}} = \frac{K}{2}\sum_j(P_j + P_{j + 1})^2$
   # $+ \sum_j  E_\text{P}(\mathbf{P}_j)$
   # $+ \big\{ (\sigma$
   # $\otimes \mathbf{b})$
   # $\times  \mathbf{l} \big\}$
   # $\cdot\mathbf{P_j}$
   # $-\sum_{j,k} E_{\text{C}}(\mathbf{P}_j - \mathbf{P}_k^{\text{C}} )$
   
   # #+BEGIN_LATEX
     \begin{align*}
      E^{\text{LT}} = &\frac{K}{2}\sum_j(P_j + P_{j + 1})^2 + \sum_j
     E_\text{P}(\mathbf{P}_j) + \big\{ (\sigma \otimes \mathbf{b}) \times
     \mathbf{l} \big\} \cdot \mathbf{P_j} \\&- \sum_{j,k} E_{\text{C}}(
     \mathbf{P}_j - \mathbf{P}_k^{\text{C}} ) 
   \end{align*}
   # #+END_LATEX
 - One can calculate:
   - Kink-pair formation energies with C in different sites.
   - C-kink trapping energies and a critical escape stress 
  # - Minimisation of energy will be achieved by the string method.
      

** Kinetic Monte-Carlo


#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:right; width: 60%">

- kMC simulations model the movement of dislocations on larger
  temporal and spatial scales than atomistics.
- Propogation of dislocation line segments are treated as rare events
  with particular rates and mechanisms depending on local environment.
- Rates for each of the mechanisms are derived from atomistic
  calculations.
- One can find dislocation velocity as a function of stress and
  temperature.

** Summary of Methods
  - Tight-binding simulations will be used to determine influence of
    carbon on dislocations and line tension model constants.
  - From line tension model of Fe dislocation, one can find
    stress-dependent kink-pair formation energies for kMC.
  - From Kinetic Monte-Carlo model of dislocations in carbon
    environment, we can observe influence of C on dislocation
    on larger timescales.

* Summary
  - Dislocation-assisted carbon migration thought to be fundamental
    mechanism behind DER formation.
  - No consensus on which mechanism is correct, if it is at all the case. 
  - Simulations can give insight into how dislocations interact with
    carbon, thus clarifying potential mechanism.

  - Tight-binding can be used to model energetics of carbon and
    dislocations and constants for line tension model.
  - Line tension model can obtain kink-pair formation and solute trap
    energies for kMC model.
  - kMC model allows for observation of dislocation motion on longer
    length and time scales, enabling elucidation of mechanisms for
    dislocation-assisted carbon migration.
  # - A combination of atomistic and kinetic monte-carlo simulations can
  #   be used to accurately model the behaviour of dislocations in an
  #   environment of carbon.
