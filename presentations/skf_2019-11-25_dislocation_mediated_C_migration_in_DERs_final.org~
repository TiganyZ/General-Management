* Motivation 
  # - Rolling contact on bearing raceways generate maximal shear
  #   stresses in subsurface.
  # - Degradation in subsurface microstructure observed.
  # - This can lead to failure by Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF).
  # - Subsurface degradation of bearing raceways arises in form of Dark
  #   Etching Regions (DERs).
  # - DERs characterised by development of ferrite and carbide features with
  #   patches of unaltered martensitic matrix.
  - Carbon redistribution and plastic deformation are thought to be
    fundamental mechanisms behind DER formation.
  - Differing mechanisms of dislocation-driven carbon migration have
    been suggested, but no consensus.
  - Atomistic modelling necessary to elucidate how dislocations could
    move carbon; thus clarifying potential mechanisms of DER formation. 

# ** DER Mechanisms
   
#    - Theories of carbon redistribution causing DERs come from several
#      observations:
#      - Ferrite formation
#      - Lenticular carbide formation
#      - Dissolution of residual carbides.
#      - Difference in C concentration from original martensite to DER. 
#    - Dislocations can attract carbon and form Cottrell atmospheres.
#    - Current theories suggest with dislocation glide, carbon
#      migration is assisted.
#    # - Growth of lenticular carbides is linked to formation of DER through
#    #   mechanical diffusion by dislocations and thermal diffusion.
#    - Debate as to whether carbon is deposited in temper carbides,
#      causing them to grow, or if there is dissolution of temper
#      carbides.


# ** New DER Mechanism proposal

#    - Dislocation pile-ups could cause attract carbon from temper/residual
#      carbides causing their dissolution.
#    - Dislocation rearrangement into cell structures from cyclic
#      stresses and dislocation-carbon interaction.
#    - Large plastic strains in region will form ferrite microbands and
#      nanocrystalline ferrite with as the number of stress cycles
#      increases.
#    - Expelled C from ferrite microbands and nanocrystalline ferrite
#      forms lenticular carbides.
#    - Carbon diffusion assisted by pipe diffusion along dislocation. 

* Aims
  To answer the questions:
  - Do dislocations assist carbon migration?
  - How are dislocations influenced by carbon on atomistic scale?
    - How does carbon affect kink-pair nucleation/migration?
    - How fast do the dislocations move in carbon environemnt?
    - What dislocation structures are found with dislocation movement? 
  - Do temper carbides dissolve/grow with rolling contact fatigue?
    - Is is more energetically favourable for a carbon to be in a
      Cottrell atmosphere or in a carbon rich grain boundary?
    # - We want to determine how these dislocations influence the
    #   movement of C:
    #   - Does C actually move with the dislocation?
    #   - Are dislocations pinned and then unpinned with stress?
    #   - How does stress actually change C diffusion rates, are they
    # 	comparable to dislocation velocities?

* Methods
  - Tight-binding simulations to determine influence of carbon on
    dislocations.
  - Line tension model of dislocation to acquire stress-dependent
    kink-pair formation energies.
  - Kinetic Monte Carlo model of dislocations in carbon environment.

- Tight binding is an approximation to DFT.

* Objectives

  - Build kinetic Monte-Carlo (kMC) model of dislocation motion. 
  - Atomistic (tight-binding) simulations used to obtain formation
    energies necessary for kMC:
    1) Kink-pair formation energies as a function of carbon content
       and stress.
    2) Dissolution energies of carbon near core of dislocation as a
       function of stress.
  - kMC model used to see larger scale movement of screw dislocation
    by kink-pair formation, in environment of C.

** BOP

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:right; width: 50%">

- BOP is a faster but less accurate $\mathcal{O}(N)$ method of interatomic
  force calculation within tight-binding.
- One builds a local density of states from moments, giving detailed
  electronic structure information.

** Embedding 

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 50%">

- Idea is to combine speed of BOP ($\mathcal{O}(N)$) with accuracy of
  tight-binding $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$.
- Increasing the number of atoms gives freedom to:
  - Investigate isolated dislocations. 
  - Include solutes at more realistic concentrations. 
  - Simulate interfaces near a surface (e.g. TiO$_2$ and
    bulk Ti)

* Methods
  - Density Functional Theory is not feasible.
  - Use tight-binding: rigorous approximation to DFT.
  
  - Boundaries of cell affect relaxation of core more.
  - Semi-empirical method is more computationally efficient.

* Defect Clusters 

- Increase in oxygen content in Ti-7wt.%Al causes higher number density of
  $\alpha_2$ precipitates at 550\deg C (Felicity's results).
- Oxygen acting as a defactant might stabilise defect complexes (Ti_v + nO).
- This can cause more defects resulting in the increased number of precipitates due to more nucleation sites.
- First starting out with pure Ti and $\alpha_2$. Still working on extension to Ti-7wt.%Al.


** Calculation Details
- F√∂rst /et al./ $[3]$ calculated energetics of defect complexes with associated local
  force-constant matrix.
- Partial thermodynamic equilibrium imposed (thermal equilibrium for one species and not the other). 
- Defect concentration plotted as a function of carbon/vacancy concentration
  only at 160\deg C.
- Extension: apply the quasiharmonic approximation/do thermodynamic integration
  for better accuracy at higher temperatures (550\deg C - 950\deg C).

** Defect Clusters: Future Work 
- Finish Ti and $\text{Ti}_{3}\text{Al}$ defect cluster calculations in DFT. 
- Possibly extend to Ti-7wt%Al with SQS structures.
- See how much of an effect anharmonicity has on predictions.


* Summary
- Successfully made TB model of Ti which reproduces DFT results with only
  d-orbitals.
- Transferable:
  - Correct energetic ordering for study of different phases. 
  - Correct elastic properties and good scaling for defect simulations.
  - Integer number of electrons for charge transfer models (electrochemistry).
- BOP formulation produces similar results with only linear scaling.
- Embedding calculations should resolve single dislocation core ground-state
  at realistic O concentrations.
- To do: Embed O-disl, $\text{Ti/TiO}_2$ interface, defect clusters.
