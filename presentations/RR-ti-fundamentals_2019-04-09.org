* Motivation 
- Titanium alloys are used in highly demanding circumstances
- Brittle oxide layer can crack.
- Solutes affect dislocation mobility and hardening.
- Interaction between oxygen and dislocation cores are not clear.
- Need for atomistic modelling.
- Exploration of Ti/oxide scale interface will give insights into oxygen
  diffusion, oxygen induces brittlness and stress corrosion cracking in Ti
  alloys. 
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Corrosion resistance, high strength to weight ratio.
- Ti is used in commercial jet airliners
#+END_NOTES


* Quantum Methods
- Density Functional Theory is not feasible.
- System size is limited due to computational cost.
- Boundaries of cell affect relaxation of core more.
- Semi-empirical method is more computationally efficient.

** Tight Binding
- Tight binding is an approximation to DFT.
- Overlaps between atomic orbitals are key parameters.
- Parameters can be fitted to experimental data

** BOP
- BOP is a faster but less accurate $\mathcal{O}(N)$ method of interatomic
  force calculation within tight binding.
- One builds a local density of states from moments, giving detailed
  electronic structure information. 

* Parameter Optimisation
- Optimisation of the parameter set has been achieved under two evolutionary
  algorithms: genetic and particle swarm.

** Results of optimisation.

* Phonon Spectra
- Phonon spectra were completed for $\alpha$, $\omega$ and $\beta$ phases with
  the new model.

#+BEGIN_NOTES

Due to the phonon modes being soft then the contribution to the free energy
for the bcc phase is not as much. 

This is why the bcc phase has a higher total free energy than the other
phases. 

#+END_NOTES

* Gamma Surfaces
- $\gamma$ -surfaces are plots of the excess energies with the movement of
  atoms on a fault plane.
- Stable stacking faults and dissociations can be seen from the local minima.


** Basal gamma surface

# Should I put in a comparison of the gamma lines and how tbe compares? 








* Core structures
- Dislocation cores are sensitive to boundary conditions.
- Sufficient resolution of core structure is necessary ascertain how
  dislocation glide is modified.
