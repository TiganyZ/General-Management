* Introduction
  - Rolling contact on bearing raceways causes /degradation in subsurface/ microstructure.
  - Failure by Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF).
  - Degradation arises in form of /Dark Etching Regions/ (DERs).
  - DERs characterised by development of ferrite and carbide features with
    patches of unaltered martensitic matrix.

** Features of DER
   #+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 48%">
   1) Martensite \rightarrow ferrite microbands (from strain localisation).
   2) Residual carbides gradually dissolve.
   3) 30\deg and 80\deg ferrite features form: White Etching Bands (WEBs).
   4) Lenticular carbides precipitate at ferrite band boundaries.
   5) Carbides thicken during DER development; correlated with WEB
      growth.
   6) Reduction in dislocation density in late stage.

** Unresolved problems
   - Where does excess carbon from the martensitic matrix find itself
     when the structure decays to low C solubility (0.02 wt%) ferrite?
   - How is carbon transported, given its low diffusivity in
     martensite/DER phases?
     #+REVEAL_HTML: <br/>
   - _Carbon redistribution_ and _plastic deformation_ are thought to be
     fundamental mechanisms behind DER formation.
   - Differing mechanisms of */dislocation-driven carbon migration/* have
     been suggested, but no consensus.
   - Can use _multi-scale modelling_ to ascertain the mechanism of
     dislocation-assisted carbon migration.



** Dislocation-assisted carbon migration
   #+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 48%">
[[file:~/Documents/docs/Management/fe_skf_paper/sebastian/Images/dislocation-assisted_carbon_migration_mechanism_fu2017_transparent.png]]
 Cyclic stresses caused by bearing use causes dislocations to drag carbon cite:Fu2017.
   #+REVEAL_HTML: </div>
   #+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:right; width: 48%">
   - Carbon segregated to dislocations.
   - Cyclic stresses cause dislocations to break away from
     carbon environment.
   - Carbon re-attracted to dislocation, causing carbon flux.
     #+REVEAL_HTML: <br />
   - Modelling can find regimes of stress/temperature/carbon
     concentration/dislocation density in which this is feasible.
   #+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

* Methods
   - _Quantum-mechanical_, atomistic (tight-binding/TB) simulations used
     to see how solutes interact with dislocations.
     - Tight-binding is more accurate than empirical potentials, with
       better scaling than DFT.
   - _Line tension model_ of dislocations used to
     ascertain how carbon interactions change dislocation movement.
   - Future work: _SCkMC model_ to simulate dislocation dynamics and measure
     effects on dislocation velocity and loop debris in carbon
     environment. cite:Katzarov2017

 # ** DER Mechanisms
   
 #    - Theories of carbon redistribution causing DERs come from several
 #      observations:
 #      - Ferrite formation
 #      - Lenticular carbide formation
 #      - Dissolution of residual carbides.
 #      - Difference in C concentration from original martensite to DER.
 #    - Dislocations can attract carbon and form Cottrell atmospheres.
 #    - Current theories suggest with dislocation glide, carbon
 #      migration is assisted.
 #    # - Growth of lenticular carbides is linked to formation of DER through
 #    #   mechanical diffusion by dislocations and thermal diffusion.
 #    - Debate as to whether carbon is deposited in temper carbides,
 #      causing them to grow, or if there is dissolution of temper
 #      carbides.


 # ** New DER Mechanism proposal

 #    - Dislocation pile-ups could cause attract carbon from temper/residual
 #      carbides causing their dissolution.
 #    - Dislocation rearrangement into cell structures from cyclic
 #      stresses and dislocation-carbon interaction.
 #    - Large plastic strains in region will form ferrite microbands and
 #      nanocrystalline ferrite with as the number of stress cycles
 #      increases.
 #    - Expelled C from ferrite microbands and nanocrystalline ferrite
 #      forms lenticular carbides.
 #    - Carbon diffusion assisted by pipe diffusion along dislocation.

# * Aims
#   To answer the questions:
#   - How can dislocations assist in carbon migration?
#   - How are dislocations influenced by carbon on atomistic scale?
#     - Is dislocation core structure affected?
#     - What is the concentration of carbon on the dislocation core?
#     - How does this amount at the core carbon affect kink-pair nucleation/migration?
#     - Will carbon be dragged with the dislocation?
  #   - How fast do the dislocations move in carbon environemnt?
  #   - What dislocation structures are found with dislocation movement?
  # - Do temper carbides dissolve/grow with rolling contact fatigue?
  #   - Is is more energetically favourable for a carbon to be in a
  #     Cottrell atmosphere or in a carbon rich grain boundary?
    # - We want to determine how these dislocations influence the
    #   movement of C:
    #   - Does C actually move with the dislocation?
    #   - Are dislocations pinned and then unpinned with stress?
    #   - How does stress actually change C diffusion rates, are they
    # 	comparable to dislocation velocities?

** Core reconstruction
   #+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:right; width: 45%">
   - C transforms the easy screw core, the ground-state core structure in pure Fe, to
     hard core.
   - /The hard screw core is the ground-state dislocation configuration
     when carbon is dissolved in ferrite/.
   - Empirical potentials only predict core spreading, /no/ spontaneous
     reconstruction to hard core.
   - C-dislocation binding energies and C-C repulsive energies can be used to find the
     concentration of carbon on dislocation line at given T.

   * Highest binding energy found inside hard core.
   * Cores fixed in position, such that reconstruction does not occur.
   * Binding to both cores important for line-tension model: to
     determine C concentration at which hard core becomes dominant.

* Concentration analysis
** Carbon concentration on dislocation line
   - Equilibrium carbon concentration on dislocation line from the C-dislocation
     binding energies.
   - Can include the effect of the C-C first-neighbour repulsive energy
     of carbon within hard-core prismatic site, which gives a more
     realistic estimation using the bare McClean Isotherm for the
     equlilbrium concentration.

   #   \frac{E_{\text{b}}^i}{k_{\text{B}}T}  \Big)    \end{equation}

** What does this tell us?
   - Dislocation cores are saturated with carbon around normal
     operating temperature (320$\deg$ K), and
     dislocation densities even up to maximum measured in martensite $\sim 5\times10^{15}$.
   - This means *all* dislocations are reconstructed to the hard core
     configuration in our material of interest.
   - How do different concentrations of carbon affect dislocation
     movement?

* Line-tension Results
** Line-tension model of dislocation

     \[ E_{\text{LT}} = \frac{K}{2} \sum_j (\vec{P}_j - \vec{P}_{j+1} )^2  + \sum_j \Delta E_{\text{P}}  (\vec{P}_j) +
    (\sigma \cdot \vec{b}) \times \vec{l} \cdot \vec{P}_j  - \sum_{j,k} E_{\text{C}} (|\vec{P}_j-\vec{P}_k^{\text{C}}|), \]

    - Equation used to obtain the line energy for the line tension model.
    - We can obtain the kink-pair formation enthalpy as a function of
      stress, temperature and carbon concentration.
    - The interaction between solutes is parameterised with a
      lorentzian.
    - String method used to find transition state image.

** Kink-pair formation enthalpies

   [[file:~/Documents/docs/Management/fe_skf_paper/sebastian/Images/kink-pair_formation_enthalpies_just_tb_results.png]]

   - The addition of carbon _reduces_ the kink-pair formation enthalpy.
   - The reduction is less than one would expect from hydrodgen as the
     interaction with carbon is longer ranged due to the large
     tetragonal distortion and binding energies.


* Future Work

** SCkMC Simulations

   - Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations incorporating carbon diffusion
     will complete the description of how carbon can move with
     dislocations

   [[file:~/Documents/docs/Management/fe_skf_paper/sebastian/Images/kMC_hydrogen_emb_I.png]]
   - Figure of kMC work with hydrogen (blue), showing dislocation line
     (black) with generated debris loops (red) during movement of
     dislocation line cite:Katzarov2017b.

* Summary
- Used tight-binding model of Fe-C, rooted in quantum mechanics, to
  simulate dislocation-C interactions.
- _Hard core_ found to be _ground-state_ in system with _carbon_.
- Equilibrium concentration of carbon on dislocation line predicts
  that _*all* dislocations are hard core_, at typical dislocation
  densities, nominal carbon concentrations and operating temperatures.
- Line-tension model shows that _carbon decreases kink-pair formation
  enthalpy_ barrier: it is easier for dislocations to move in a carbon environment.
- Carbon decreases the stress necessary to move the screw
  dislocations at all temperatures.
