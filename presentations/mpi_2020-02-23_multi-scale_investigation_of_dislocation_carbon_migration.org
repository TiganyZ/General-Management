* Introduction
  - Rolling contact on bearing raceways generate maximal shear
    stresses in subsurface.
  - Degradation of subsurface microstructure observed.
  - This can lead to failure by Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF).
  - Subsurface degradation arises in form of Dark
    Etching Regions (DERs).
  - DERs characterised by development of ferrite and carbide features with
    patches of unaltered martensitic matrix.

* Motivation 
  - Carbon redistribution and plastic deformation are thought to be
    fundamental mechanisms behind DER formation.
  - Differing mechanisms of dislocation-driven carbon migration have
    been suggested, but no consensus.
  - Atomistic modelling necessary to elucidate how dislocations could
    move carbon; thus clarifying potential mechanisms of DER formation. 

# ** DER Mechanisms
   
#    - Theories of carbon redistribution causing DERs come from several
#      observations:
#      - Ferrite formation
#      - Lenticular carbide formation
#      - Dissolution of residual carbides.
#      - Difference in C concentration from original martensite to DER. 
#    - Dislocations can attract carbon and form Cottrell atmospheres.
#    - Current theories suggest with dislocation glide, carbon
#      migration is assisted.
#    # - Growth of lenticular carbides is linked to formation of DER through
#    #   mechanical diffusion by dislocations and thermal diffusion.
#    - Debate as to whether carbon is deposited in temper carbides,
#      causing them to grow, or if there is dissolution of temper
#      carbides.


# ** New DER Mechanism proposal

#    - Dislocation pile-ups could cause attract carbon from temper/residual
#      carbides causing their dissolution.
#    - Dislocation rearrangement into cell structures from cyclic
#      stresses and dislocation-carbon interaction.
#    - Large plastic strains in region will form ferrite microbands and
#      nanocrystalline ferrite with as the number of stress cycles
#      increases.
#    - Expelled C from ferrite microbands and nanocrystalline ferrite
#      forms lenticular carbides.
#    - Carbon diffusion assisted by pipe diffusion along dislocation. 

* Aims
  To answer the questions:
  - How can dislocations assist in carbon migration?
  - How are dislocations influenced by carbon on atomistic scale?
    - Is dislocation core structure affected?
    - How does carbon affect kink-pair nucleation/migration?
  #   - How fast do the dislocations move in carbon environemnt?
  #   - What dislocation structures are found with dislocation movement?
  # - Do temper carbides dissolve/grow with rolling contact fatigue?
  #   - Is is more energetically favourable for a carbon to be in a
  #     Cottrell atmosphere or in a carbon rich grain boundary?
    # - We want to determine how these dislocations influence the
    #   movement of C:
    #   - Does C actually move with the dislocation?
    #   - Are dislocations pinned and then unpinned with stress?
    #   - How does stress actually change C diffusion rates, are they
    # 	comparable to dislocation velocities?

* Methods
  - Quantum-mechanical tight-binding simulations used to determine
    influence of atomistic carbon on dislocations (more accurate than
    empirical potentials, better scaling than DFT).
  - Line tension model of dislocation to acquire stress-dependent
    kink-pair formation energies.
  - Future work is to use kMC model to see what happens at even larger
    scale of large-scale dislocation movement.

* Carbon concentration on dislocation line
  - Can solve for the equilibrium carbon concentration on the
    dislocation line from the Fe-C binding energies around the
    dislocation core.
  - Can include the effect of the C-C first-neighbour repulsive
    energy, which reduces the overestimation from using the bare
    McClean Isotherm for the equlilbrium concentration.

    \begin{equation}  \frac{ c_d^{i} }{1 -  c_d^{i} } = \frac{ c_{\text{bulk}} }{1 - c_{\text{bulk}} } \text{exp} \Big(
    \frac{E_{\text{b}}^i}{k_{\text{B}}T}  \Big)    \end{equation}

  \begin{equation}  N_{\text{oct}}    c_{\text{bulk}} + N_d c_d = N_{\text{oct}} c_{\text{nom}}/3  \end{equation}

* Line tension

    \[ E_{\text{LT}} = \frac{K}{2} \sum_j (\vec{P}_j - \vec{P}_{j+1} )^2  + \sum_j \Delta E_{\text{P}}  (\vec{P}_j) +
   (\sigma \cdot \vec{b}) \times \vec{l} \cdot \vec{P}_j  - \sum_{j,k} E_{\text{C}} (|\vec{P}_j-\vec{P}_k^{\text{C}}|), \]

   - Equation used for the line tension model.
   - The interaction between solutes is parameterised with a
     lorentzian.


** Kink-pair formation enthalpies

   [[file:~/Documents/docs/Management/fe_skf_paper/sebastian/Images/kink-pair_formation_enthalpies_just_results.png]]

   - The addition of carbon reduces the kink-pair formation enthalpy.
   - The reduction is less than one would expect from hydrodgen as the
     interaction with carbon is longer ranged due to the large
     tetragonal distortion and binding energies.

* Summary
- Obtained Peierls potential and binding energies of carbon distributed around hard and easy screw
  dislocation cores from quantum-mechanical atomistic simulations.
- Calculated the equilibrium concentration of carbon on the
  dislocation line by calculation of C-C repulsive energies.
- Find that *all* dislocations are hard core, at typical dislocation densities,
  nominal carbon concentrations and temperatures, due to the
  reconstruction of easy core due to carbon-dislocation interaction
  and operating temperatures.
- Carbon decreases the stress necessary to move the screw
  dislocations at all temperatures.
