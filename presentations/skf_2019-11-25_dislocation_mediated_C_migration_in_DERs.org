* Motivation 
  - Rolling contact on bearing raceways generate maximal shear
    stresses in subsurface.
  - Degradation in subsurface microstructure observed due to
    plasticity.
  - This can lead to failure by Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF).
  - Degradation arises in form of Dark Etching Regions (DERs),
    characterised by development of ferrite features with patches of
    unaltered martensitic matrix.
  - Carbon redistribution is thought to be a fundamental mechanism
    behind DER formation.
  - Dislocation-driven carbon migration has been suggested but hard to
    experimentally verify.
  - Atomistic modelling necessary to ascertain if dislocations move
    carbon and the underlying mechanism. 

** Current Potential Mechanisms
   
   - Theories of carbon redisribution come from observations of C
     concentrations and of formation of lenticular carbides around
     ferrite features in the DERs.
   - Carbon can segregate to defects such as dislocations. 
   - Dislocations can attract solutes, such at C, and form Cottrell
     atmospheres.
   - Current theories suggest that with plastic deformation, due to
     the movement of dislocations, carbon /migrates/.

   #+REVEAL:split

   - We want to determine how these dislocations influence the
     movement of C:
     - Does C actually move with the dislocation?
     - Are dislocations pinned and then unpinned with stress?
     - How does stress actually change C diffusion rates, are they
       comparable to dislocation velocities?
     - How is dislocation movement affected on larger timescales: what
       structures are found?
    
    

* Objectives

  - Build Kinetic Monte-Carlo model of dislocation motion. 
  - Tight-binding/ atomistic simulations used to obtain formation energies:
    1) Kink-pair formation energies as a function of carbon content
       and stress.
    2) Dissolution energies of carbon near core of dislocation as a
       function of stress.
  - kMC model used to see larger scale movement of screw dislocation
    by kink-pair formation, in environment of C. 


* Aims
  To answer the questions:
  - Do dislocations move carbon?
  - Do temper carbides dissolve/grow with rolling contact fatigue?


* Methods
  - Density Functional Theory is not feasible.
  - Use tight-binding: rigorous approximation to DFT.
  
  - Boundaries of cell affect relaxation of core more.
  - Semi-empirical method is more computationally efficient.

** Tight Binding


#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 50%">

- Tight binding is an approximation to DFT.
- Overlaps between atomic orbitals are key parameters.
- Parameters can be fitted to experimental data
- $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$, but much smaller prefactor compared to DFT.

** BOP

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:right; width: 50%">

- BOP is a faster but less accurate $\mathcal{O}(N)$ method of interatomic
  force calculation within tight-binding.
- One builds a local density of states from moments, giving detailed
  electronic structure information.

** Embedding 

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 50%">

- Idea is to combine speed of BOP ($\mathcal{O}(N)$) with accuracy of
  tight-binding $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$.
- Increasing the number of atoms gives freedom to:
  - Investigate isolated dislocations. 
  - Include solutes at more realistic concentrations. 
  - Simulate interfaces near a surface (e.g. TiO$_2$ and
    bulk Ti)

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Invariance theorem with green's function approaches. So good with boundary
conditions. 

#+END_NOTES

* Defect Clusters 

- Increase in oxygen content in Ti-7wt.%Al causes higher number density of
  $\alpha_2$ precipitates at 550\deg C (Felicity's results).
- Oxygen acting as a defactant might stabilise defect complexes (Ti_v + nO).
- This can cause more defects resulting in the increased number of precipitates due to more nucleation sites.
- First starting out with pure Ti and $\alpha_2$. Still working on extension to Ti-7wt.%Al.


** Calculation Details
- Först /et al./ $[3]$ calculated energetics of defect complexes with associated local
  force-constant matrix.
- Partial thermodynamic equilibrium imposed (thermal equilibrium for one species and not the other). 
- Defect concentration plotted as a function of carbon/vacancy concentration
  only at 160\deg C.
- Extension: apply the quasiharmonic approximation/do thermodynamic integration
  for better accuracy at higher temperatures (550\deg C - 950\deg C).

** Defect Clusters: Future Work 
- Finish Ti and $\text{Ti}_{3}\text{Al}$ defect cluster calculations in DFT. 
- Possibly extend to Ti-7wt%Al with SQS structures.
- See how much of an effect anharmonicity has on predictions.


* Summary
- Successfully made TB model of Ti which reproduces DFT results with only
  d-orbitals.
- Transferable:
  - Correct energetic ordering for study of different phases. 
  - Correct elastic properties and good scaling for defect simulations.
  - Integer number of electrons for charge transfer models (electrochemistry).
- BOP formulation produces similar results with only linear scaling.
- Embedding calculations should resolve single dislocation core ground-state
  at realistic O concentrations.
- To do: Embed O-disl, $\text{Ti/TiO}_2$ interface, defect clusters.
