** BOP
** Embedding
** Fitting
   - Explain algorithms 
   - Regularization - Elastic Net
     - What's the benefit? 
   - How could I have made it better if it failed. 
*** TODO Finalize model for fitting 
    DEADLINE: <2020-11-16 Mon>

** Remarks on tight-binding
   - Love it / Loathe it
   - Remark how with tight-binding we can see the different
     contributions to the total energy.
   - P. W. Anderson's theory on tight-binding. Dismissing it
     initially, but it's the right way to think about solids

* Dislocations in pure metals
** Fe 
   - Comparison of the:
     - sd, non-orthogonal tight-binding models.
     - d-canonical model

*** DONE Peierls Potential 

*** TODO Plot d/sd peierls potential - How does non-O/sd change?

** Ti
*** TODO Energy dependence and core energy 
    DEADLINE: <2020-12-20 Sun>
*** TODO Core Energy difference in tbe - bop
    DEADLINE: <2020-11-16 Mon>
    - Tiny difference of 0.53 eV which determines the difference
      between each of the core energies.
*** TODO Calculate gamma surfaces for new model
    DEADLINE: <2020-11-23 Mon>
    - Planar faults 
      - Compare to DFT literature of Rodney, Curtin and Tarrat
      - Compare to other TB models
	- ICAMS model is rubbish!


* Oxygen in Ti
  - TB >> DFT!
    - Because we can decompose the total energy into contributions
    - Look at how tight-binding allows us to see the physics by
      breaking down the total energy.
