* Statement of the Problem

  I do think that an underlying theme in your thesis can be what can and
  cannot be rendered in TB in the plasticity of transition metals with and
  without interstitials. And you can discuss how good (or rather bad) EAM
  is, especially with interstitials. You may also be sceptical of the DFT,
  especially in view of the difficulty with cell size and boundary
  conditions. And not forgetting that the French school's theory of jerky
  glice in Ti is based on a calculation of core energy difference that is
  within the error limits.

* Introduction: Literature Review
  A lot of good information already in
  [[file:literature_and_notes/notes_and_literature.org]]

  For DFT, use the chapter [[file:chapters/current_dft_chapter.org]]

  We have dislocation modelling in

     - In Nematollahi, the change in occupancies is dependent on the
       activation of the energy barrier between sites.
     - This energy barrier is the migration energy barrier

       \begin{align*}
         \frac{\partial \chi_i}{\partial t} = \sum_{j=1}^4 \left\{
       &\chi_j (1 - \chi_i) \nu_0^{\text{migration}} \exp{\left[ -
       E_{\text{barrier}}^{i\rightarrow j} / k_{\text{B}} T\right]}\\ -
              &\chi_i (1 - \chi_j) \nu_0^{\text{migration}} \exp{\left[ -
       E_{\text{barrier}}^{j\rightarrow i} / k_{\text{B}} T\right]}
       \right\} + \frac{\bar{v}_{\text{disl}}}{a/2} [x_{j+} - x_{i}]
       \end{align*}

     - Last term is a convection term which can be added to account for
       a moving dislocation (going to the right)
     - Where a $j+$ site is to the right of the $i^{\text{th}}$ site,
       and an $j-$ occupied to the left.
     - With dislocation movement the occupations /move backwards/ from
       the $j+$ to $i^{\text{th}}$ and from $i^{\text{th}}$ to $j-$
       sites.
     - Summation over 4 as 4 "first-neighbour" octahedral sites.


     - In Ivo's paper, the change in occupancy has a time dependence,
       which is due to the velocity of a dislocation.
     - This mediated between the two limiting regimes of static and
       equilbrium occupancies upon dislocation motion.

       \[ \frac{\partial \chi_i}{\partial t} = \bar{v}\frac{\partial
       \chi_i}{\partial x} = \left( \chi_i^e(x) - \chi_i(x,\bar{v})
       \right) \nu_0^{\text{solute escape}} \exp{ - E_i(r) / k_{\text{B}} T} \]

     - Here the attempt frequencies are different as one is for a
       hydrogen to escape from the binding of the dislocation to the
       bulk, and the other is to escape the relative energy barrier
       between sites.

     - If it is possible to assume that one can superimpose the
       occupancy effects of carbon _diffusion_, then we can have an
       equation for the velocity dependence.

  - Velocity defined by orowan's equation in Nematollahi [[file:roam/nematollahi2016a.org][Nematollahi2016a: Multiscale description of carbon-supersaturated ferrite in severely drawn pearlitic wires]]
  - We can use the self-consistent description of velocity in our
    calculations such that we know what the velocity is from the line
    tension model.
  - Compare with dislocation velocity range found in the paper of
    80-1000 Å/s.
  - Intermediate positions of the high mobility zone correspond to
    hard core config.
  - What is actually posssible is discrete diffusion within the line
    tension model! We just need to measure the energy barriers

      Integrals. Waiting for writing.
    - Explain algorithms 
    - Regularization - Elastic Net
      - What's the benefit? 
    - How could I have made it better if it failed. 
    - Martin cite:Martin2004, states that 
      - A /small/ basis of /orthogonal/ functions /must/ be long-ranged and
	environmentally-dependent to be accurate.
      - Whereas non-orthogonal functions can describe the system will with
        short-ranged atomic range functions, independent of environmental
        dependence.
    - In essence, this must mean I should argue against transferability? We know
      that people make a load of tight-binding models and never use them.
    - Our use case is the fact we can do embedding with this, so we do not mind
      about /absolute/ transferability. We just want to predict the correct
      quantities relevant to our problem of defects in titanium.
    - Even without this currently we have failed to find a model. Perhaps
      non-orthogonality/environmental dependence is necessary to describe the
      model
    - Perhaps, using the BOP code, one can put in environment dependent terms
      and see if the dissociation distance changes, but this is quite a large
      ask in the timeframe

       _TiO2 objective function_

       For the intel binary, when running the TiO2 objective function
       for the solution energies we get NaN for some eigenvalues
       during self-consistency. This only seems to be a problem for
       reasonably sized cells.
       Putting the verbosity up to ~--pr81~ gives:

       It fails within the first self-consistency cycle.

**** WAITING Pure Ti canonical ratio model
     - See how the canonical ratio changes things in the model
     - Justification for exponentials is essentially to allow the bond
       integrals more freedom for variation, which has limited
       transferability in other models.
     - Canonical ratio is fitting in other thing. We actually see that
       the bandwidths from the functions which were fitted to the
       Urban results are smaller
     - The range for the bond integrals seems reasonable, so perhaps
       the actual orthogonalisation procedure is not as good as they
       say when applied to the tbe code.
     - I suppose it really depends on the ranges of the bond
       integrals.

****** DONE Actions [6/6]

      - [X] Do I just include carbon along the whole dislocation line?
	Talk to Ivo perhaps about teams and the like

      - [X] Implement the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics for the concentration.

      - [X]  Include initial summation of concentrations along [5/5]
	dislocation line.
	- [X] Constrain total concentration
	- [X] Make new file which controls the addition of concentration
          dependence along the dislocation line
	- [X] Define trap sites for an image:
	  - These are ones which reside in the plane of the dislocation.
	  - The solute redistributes in each plane only.
	  - Does the occupation probability does not "spill over" into
            other segments.
	  - Are these just the usual octahedral sites within the line?
	  - What is the redistribution?
	    * I assume the redistribution is just the change in
              concentration from the dislocation moving, so the trap
              site is in another relative position, therefore the
              concentration of that particular site is less (think of
              the spline distance dependence).
	    * As its intra-planar, then the trap sites depend on the 2d
              distance from the core position. We know the octahedral
              positions thankfully.
	  - We could include the effects of the other sites further from
            the dislocation also. It would complicate the implementation
            though, as mappings aren't unique: how can one smoothly
            transition a site when the hard core does not have a similar
            distribution of trap sites to the easy core?
	  - Ivo chooses this latter description, with some reasonable
            (albeit wrong) assumptions.
	  - Each core should have all the trap sites from molecular
            statics described, but then their action should be scaled by
            the number of sites which "decay" to that position.
	- [X] Describe paths along the transition between easy and hard
          core.
	- [X] Figure out how to circumvent the trap site problem
	  - From easy to hard there is different mappings of sites.
	  - Need mapping of all sites such that it is symmetric.
	  - Can include all sites, but then there is a difference in the
            range of interactions which are included in the x direction
            (more than the y direction).
	  - *Fixed*:
	    - Will find the many-to-one mappings and
              multiplicatively scale each of the interactions based on the
              distance from the initial easy core site.
	    - Isolated sites will be multiplicatively scaled to zero by
              the same process.
	    - This multiplicative action will also modify the energies
              in the same way.

      - Follow the notes on Ivo's paper [[file:roam/gonginfluencehydrogenplasticity2020.org::#gongInfluenceHydrogenPlasticity2020][The influence of hydrogen on plasticity in pure iron—theory and experiment]]
      - [X] Why are the dependences not changing with concentration?
	 They are.
      - [X] Check that the full temperature dependent concentrations
	 are giving sensible results.
      - [X] Solve why Spline is giving zeros for concentration at any distance

****** Notes

      - Making a function such that at a given distance of a solute one
	can get the McClean isotherm concentration.
      - Input: distance, Output: concentration
      - The data fed into the system are the energies from the lorentzian
	at different distances. These act at formation energies in the
	equations for the solution of the McClean isotherm.

   - P. W. Anderson's theory on tight-binding. Dismissing it
     initially, but it's the right way to think about solids

     really give us insights into the electronic structure, or if it
     just is a good fitting machine with a lack of some physical
     insight.

    - State "HOLD"       from "WAITING"    [2020-09-03 Thu 12:46]

      - Why would they be necessary in the description?

      - Bonding-wise, why would they be necessary? Hybridisation?

*** HOLD How does overlap and non-orthogonality play a role?

    - In Trinkle's NOTB model and Hennig's MEAM, the dissociation distance is
      small.
    - NOTB includes overlap and s-orbitals.
    - MEAM includes an angular dependence which varies with the density
      - This models the effects of bond bending.
      - Lenosky et al. modified the original MEAM potential by using cubic
        splines for the functional form. This removes the constraint of fixed
        angular char- acter and allows for additional flexibility of the
        potential. cite:hennig08_class_poten_descr_marten_phase

    - State "WAITING"    from "TODO"       [2021-08-24 Tue 15:47] \\
      Running full calculation for the final image in the cluster
      calculation to check that the free energies and the change in them is
      comparable. I will have to do this for another cell too.
    - It seems that one would be missing out on some normal modes
      doing this.
    - We restrict the collective lattice waves within a particular region
    - Furthermore, the calculation of the dynamical matrix has the
      assumption that there is periodicity in all three
      directions.
    - Extracting the force from a subset seems unreasonable. It may
      think that the force from one displacement in the original
      unit cell, would cause a force somewhere else, as there is a
      compressive stress always on the subset of the lattice.
    - On the other hand, we expect that the difference in the
      energies would be reasonably approximated as then it is the
      difference in the local atomic environment which would give
      the energies.
