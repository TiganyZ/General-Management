#+title: EFA Plans
#+author: Tigany Zarrouk

* Plans
  - Primary key for manufacturer
  - Test by deleting and redoing
  - Create script with to generate the site cashflow dynamically.
  - MySQL database

* Code structure

  - Implements the SOLID design principles where possible.
  - Essentially, create interfaces for communication to abstract
    dependencies from actual class structures to the interface itself.


** Model | Calculator

** View | Django

** Controller | Communication/Interfaces
* Database

   - This first iteration will be part of the minimum value product, as
     such, complicated functionality, which will be seen in the final
     product⸻such as tailoring the calculation to a specific user's
     community energy as part of EFA⸻is left out.

   - In the final iteration, we will have all the necessary data for a
     project in a PostgreSQL database.

   - We will store some PV information in the PosgreSQL database such
     that we can have some time getting used to getting data from
     there.

   - Perhaps one write some database code to do some
     calculations from there also.
