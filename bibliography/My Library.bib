For five titanium tilt boundaries, including T1, T2, and C1 twin systems, we determine the GB structure, as well as GB energy and excess volume. The segregation energies and volumes of carbon and oxygen are calculated for 23 inequivalent interstitial voids, while for co-segregation 75 configurations are considered. It is obtained that depending on the type of the segregation void both a positive and a negative segregation process is possible. The physical reasons of segregation are explained in terms of the analysis of the void atomic geometry, excess volume and features of the electronic structure at the Fermi level. Although carbon and oxygen show qualitatively similar properties in α-Ti, several distinctions are observed for their segregation behavior and mutual interactions.},

Various bulk and defect properties are compared to validate the transferability of the new potential.

In order to simplify and to facilitate the construction of lowest energy configurations in the complex energy landscape of C15 clusters, we test and propose three selection rules.},

  abstract = {The absorption and diffusion of oxygen in the Ti3Al alloy are studied by the projector augmented wave within the density functional theory. The highest absorption energies are shown to correspond to the sites in the octahedra formed by six titanium atoms, and the presence of aluminum in the nearest neighbors leads to a substantial decrease in the binding energy of oxygen in the alloy by approximately 1.5 eV. The energy barriers of oxygen diffusion between various interstices in the crystal lattice of the alloy are estimated, and the preferred migration paths in the (0001) plane and the [0001] direction are determined. It is found that the migration barrier from the most preferred octahedral O1 site to distorted tetrahedral Ti-site (2.42 eV) is a key barrier and limits the oxygen diffusion in the alloy. The calculated temperature diffusion coefficient of oxygen in the Ti3Al alloy and the activation energies determined in two directions agree with the experimental data.},

  abstract = {Slip systems involving dislocations with {$<$}a{$>$} Burgers vectors have been studied in hexagonal close packed Zr and Ti, by means of in situ straining experiments in a transmission electron microscope, at various temperatures and as a function of resolved shear stress. The results show that Zr and Ti are very similar in many respects. Prismatic slip is activated at rather low resolved shear stresses, and is controlled by the interaction between mobile dislocations and solute atoms (presumably oxygen). Pyramidal slip requires substantially higher resolved shear stresses and is characterized by straight screw dislocations moving by a kink-pair mechanism. Basal slip is activated at and above room temperature, for resolved shear stresses equal or higher than those in the prismatic planes. The slip traces are always wavy, presumably due to intensive cross slip from basal to prismatic planes. It also involves straight screw dislocations moving by a kink-pair mechanism. These microscopic observations are discussed in the light of some aspects of the mechanical behavior, in particular the increase of yield-stress at decreasing temperature and the discontinuity of activation area close to room temperature.},

The extended Lagrangian molecular dynamics formalism restores time reversal symmetry in the propagation of the electronic degrees of freedom, and it enables the efficient and accurate self-consistent optimization of the chemical potential and atomwise potential energy shifts in the on-site elements of the tight-binding Hamiltonian that are required when enforcing local charge neutrality. These capabilities are illustrated with microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations of a small metallic cluster using an sd-valent tight-binding model for titanium. The effects of weak dissipation on the propagation of the auxiliary degrees of freedom for the chemical potential and on-site Hamiltonian matrix elements that is used to counteract the accumulation of numerical noise during trajectories was also investigated.},

This process is studied here using ab initio calculations based on the density functional theory. The atomic simulations show that a strong repulsion exists only when the O atoms lie in the dislocation core and belong to the prismatic dislocation habit plane. This is a consequence of the destruction of the octahedral sites by the stacking fault arising from the dislocation dissociation. Because of the repulsion, the dislocation partially cross-slips to an adjacent prismatic plane, in agreement with experiments where the lattice friction on screw dislocations in Zr-O alloys has been attributed to the presence of jogs on the dislocations due to local cross-slip.},

  abstract = {A fully atomistic model of a compact electric double layer at the rutile TiO2(1\,1\,0)-water interface is constructed by adding protons to bridging oxygens or removing them from H2O molecules adsorbed on terminal metal cation sites. The surface charge is compensated by F− or Na+ counter ions in outer as well as inner sphere coordination. For each of the protonation states the energy of the TiO2 conduction band minimum is determined relative to the standard hydrogen electrode by computing the free energy for the combined insertion of an electron in the solid and a proton in solution away from the double layer using density functional theory based molecular dynamics methods. Interpreted as electrode potentials, this gives an estimate of the capacitance which is compared to the capacitance obtained from the difference in the average electrostatic potentials in the solid and aqueous phase. When aligned at the point of zero charge these two methods lead to almost identical potential-charge profiles. We find that inner sphere complexes have a slightly larger capacitance (0.4 F m−2) compared to outer sphere complexes (0.3 F m−2).},

  abstract = {This chapter reviews the different methodological aspects of the ab initio modeling of dislocations. Such simulations are now frequently used to study the dislocation core, i.e. the region in the immediate vicinity of the line defect where the crystal is so strongly distorted that an atomic description is needed. This core region controls some dislocation fundamental properties, like their ability to glide in different crystallographic planes. Ab initio calculations based on the density functional theory offer a predictive way to model this core region. Because dislocations break the periodicity of the crystal and induce long range elastic fields, several specific approaches relying on different boundary conditions have been developed to allow for the atomistic modeling of these defects in simulation cells having a size compatible with ab initio calculations. We describe these different approaches which can be used to study dislocations with ab initio calculations and introduce the different analyses which are currently performed to characterize the core structure, before discussing how meaningful energy properties can be extracted from such simulations.},

  abstract = {In this contribution, we propose a review of the possible implications of hydrogen on mechanical behaviour of Zr and Ti alloys with emphasis on the mechanisms of plasticity and strain hardening. Recent advances on the impact of oxygen and hydrogen on the activation volume show that oxygen content hinders creep but hydrogen partially screens this effect. Both aspects are discussed in terms of a locking–unlocking model of the screw dislocation mobility in prismatic slip. Additionally, possible extension of this behaviour is suggested for the                                                              pyramidal slip. The low hydrogen solubility in both Zr and Ti leads in many cases to hydride precipitation. The nature of these phases depends on the hydrogen content and can show crystallographic orientation relationships with the hexagonal compact structure of the alloys. Some advances on the thermal stability of these phases are illustrated and discussed in relation with the deepening of the misfit dislocations. Under tensile loading, we showed that hydrides enhance the hardening process in relation with internal stress due to strain incompatibilities between the Zr and Ti matrix and hydride phases. Different plastic yielding processes of hydrides were identified, which progressively reduce these strain incompatibilities.                          This article is part of the themed issue ‘The challenges of hydrogen and metals’.},

  abstract = {The influence of the local environment on C and H atoms was investigated in Ni3Nb-D0a (space group 59) and Ni3Nb-D022 (space group 139) crystals. The interstitial positions of these atoms and their solubility energies were studied by analyzing the results of first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The results were compared with those obtained in pure and Nb alloyed fcc Ni. For C atoms, several possible interstitial sites were found, but only one (per structure) is slightly more stable than the others: the 4d sites for D0a and the 4c sites for D022. The C atom is slightly soluble and its solubility energy is equivalent in the two intermetallic structures: approximately equal to 1.06 eV, which is significantly larger than in fcc Ni (0.55 eV). In the case of hydrogen, other interstitial sites were identified: the 4e positions for both D0a and D022. The solubility energy in D0a (approximately 0.12 eV, without the zero-point energy correction) was found to be smaller than that in D022 (0.17 eV) but larger than that in nickel (0.09 eV). With the zero-point energy correction, the solubility in both Ni3Nb alloys is therefore equivalent. These results were finally used to assess the fraction of light elements in Ni3Nb relative to that in fcc Ni and that in Ni doped Nb.},

  abstract = {We present a study of the stability of n-vacancies (Vn) and hydrogens in the hexagonal close-packed titanium system computed by means of first-principles calculations. In this work, performed by using the generalized gradient approximation of density functional theory, we focused on the formation energies and the processes of migration of these defects. In the first part, the calculated formation energy of the monovacancy presents a disagreement with experimental data, as already mentioned in the literature. The activation energy is underestimated by almost 20\%. The stability of compact divacancies was then studied. We show that a divacancy is more stable than a monovacancy if their migration energies are of the same order of magnitude. We also predict that the migration process in the basal plane of the divacancy is controlled by an intermediate state corresponding to a body-centered triangle (BO site). The case of the trivacancies is finally considered from an energetic point of view. In the second part, the insertion of hydrogen and the processes of its migration are discussed. We obtain a satisfactory agreement with experimental measurements. The chemical nature of the interactions between hydrogen and titanium are discussed, and we show that the H-atom presents an anionic behavior in the metal. The trapping energy of hydrogen in a monovacancy as a function of the number of hydrogen atoms is finally presented.},

These structures are used as the basis of a deformation quantization, using the methods of pAQFT. The SJ state is defined and discussed as a particular quantum state on the free quantum theory. Finally, using the framework of pAQFT, we construct interacting models for arbitrary interactions that are smooth functions of the field configurations. This is the first construction of such a wide class of models achieved in QFT on causal sets.},

  abstract = {In a fusion tokamak, the plasma of hydrogen isotopes is in contact with tungsten at the surface of a divertor. In the bulk of the material, the hydrogen concentration profile tends towards dynamic equilibrium between the flux of incident ions and their trapping and release from defects, either native or produced by ion and neutron irradiation. The dynamics of hydrogen exchange between the plasma and the material is controlled by pressure, temperature, and also by the energy barriers characterizing hydrogen diffusion in the material, trapping and de-trapping from defects. In this work, we extend the treatment of interaction of hydrogen with vacancy-type defects, and investigate how hydrogen is trapped by self-interstitial atom defects and dislocations. The accumulation of hydrogen on dislocation loops and dislocations is assessed using a combination of density functional theory (DFT), molecular dynamics with empirical potentials, and linear elasticity theory. The equilibrium configurations adopted by hydrogen atoms in the core of dislocations as well as in the elastic fields of defects, are modelled by DFT. The structure of the resulting configurations can be rationalised assuming that hydrogen atoms interact elastically with lattice distortions and that they interact between themselves through short-range repulsion. We formulate a two-shell model for hydrogen interaction with an interstitial defect of any size, which predicts how hydrogen accumulates at defects, dislocation loops and line dislocations at a finite temperature. We derive analytical formulae for the number of hydrogen atoms forming the Cottrell atmosphere of a mesoscopic dislocation loop or an edge dislocation. The solubility of hydrogen as a function of temperature, pressure and the density of dislocations exhibits three physically distinct regimes, dominated by the solubility of hydrogen in a perfect lattice, its retention at dislocation cores, and trapping by long-range elastic fields of dislocations.},

This paper starts with a summary of the wide variety of technical ®elds where TiO2 is of importance. The bulk structure and bulk defects (as far as relevant to the surface properties) are brie¯y reviewed. Rules to predict stable oxide surfaces are exempli®ed on rutile (1 1 0). The surface structure of rutile (1 1 0) is discussed in some detail. Theoretically predicted and experimentally determined relaxations of surface geometries are compared, and defects (step edge orientations, point and line defects, impurities, surface manifestations of crystallographic shear planesÐCSPs) are discussed, as well as the image contrast in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The controversy about the correct model for the (1 Â 2) reconstruction appears to be settled. Different surface preparation methods, such as reoxidation of reduced crystals, can cause a drastic effect on surface geometries and morphology, and recommendations for preparing different TiO2(1 1 0) surfaces are given. The structure of the TiO2(1 0 0)-(1 Â 1) surface is discussed and the proposed models for the (1 Â 3) reconstruction are critically reviewed. Very recent results on anatase (1 0 0) and (1 0 1) surfaces are included.},

  abstract = {Generation of realistic Grain Boundaries (GBs) in bicrystals for atomistic simulations requires a search in a multidimensional space for a configuration with the atoms at the GB organized in such a way that the energy of the whole system is minimized. This paper presents a genetic algorithm that allows to find low energy GB configurations by optimizing three main criteria: the local arrangement of the atoms, the relative translation between the two grains that compose the GB and an overall expansion/contraction of the system. It is designed to make a wider and more effective search through the energy landscape compared to other traditional methods, giving access to more configurations and increasing the possibility of finding the global minimum in energy.},

  abstract = {The deformation modes in magnesium nanocrystals during uniaxial tension, uniaxial compression, and pure bending are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at room temperature. For each loading condition, the crystal orientation effects are studied by increasing the crystal c-axis orientation angle θ relative to the loading direction from 0\,deg to 90\,deg by a 15\,deg increment. The simulation results reveal a number of different deformation modes and an obvious tension–compression asymmetry in magnesium nanocrystals. As the c-axis is rotated away from the tension loading direction, the deformation mode at yielding changes from tension twinning (θ\,≤\,45\,deg) to compression twinning (θ\,{$>$}\,45\,deg). For compression loading, yielding is dominated by only dislocation slip on the pyramidal (θ\,{$<$}\,15\,deg), basal (15\,deg\,{$<$}\,θ\,{$<$}\,60\,deg) and prismatic (θ\,{$>$}\,60\,deg) planes. The nucleation stress in general decreases with increasing θ for both uniaxial tension and uniaxial compression loadings. For pure bending simulations, the yielding is mostly controlled by the weaker deformation mode between the compressive and tensile sides. The bending nucleation stress also decreases as the c-axis deviates away from the loading direction.},

We present a selfconsistent tight-binding model which, for the first time, includes electrostatic ion polarisability and crystal field splitting. The tight-binding eigenvectors are used to construct multipole moments of the ionic charges which are used to obtain angular momentum components of the electrostatic potential in structure constant expansions. Our first test of the model is to study the phase stability in zirconia; in particular the instability of the fluorite phase to a spontaneous symmetry breaking, and its interpretation in terms of band effects and ion polarisability. This new formalism opens up the way to apply the tight-binding approximation to problems in which polarisationof atomic charges is important, for example oxides and other ceramic materials and surfaces of metals.},

  abstract = {In the theory of defects and surfaces the solution for a small part of the solid is often all that is of interest. This paper considers the problem of finding within such a small subdomain or ‘cluster’ the correct solution to the equation of motion of the whole system. It is first shown how the ‘embedding-potential’ method of ‘perturbed-cluster’ theory is equivalent to the usual Green function methods of ‘perturbed-crystal’theory. Then other ’perturbed-cluster’ methods are considered and it is shown that, because of the further assumptions about the solution that are involved, they fail to remove properly some of the spurious features introduced by performing a cluster calculation. This is demonstrated by thesolutionofsimplemodelsystems. Itisshown how the matrixelementsofcertainoperators and the correct normalisation of the state function can be calculated from a solution in the cluster region only. Next it is shown that the real-space embedding procedure introduced by Inglesfield corresponds in a discrete basis to a fundamentally different way of calculating the embedding potential, which is especially suitable for use in surface problems. This too is illustrated with a simple example, and some implicit equations for the embedding potential that do not involve the Green function of the host crystal are derived for the case where different possible cluster boundaries are related by lattice symmetry operations. Finally the implementation of these schemes and the application of the ideas to other quantum problems involving subdomains are briefly considered.},

  abstract = {The nucleation and growth of lenticular carbides (LCs) in bearing steels occur near to deformed ferrite bands after exposure to prolonged rolling contact fatigue (RCF). Since the first observations in 1947, a large number of attempts have been made to explain the formation mechanisms of such stress-induced microstructural alterations, but a reliable model was still not available. In this research, a novel theory is proposed to describe the carbon redistribution process during LC formation. The theory suggests a dislocation assisted LC growth mechanism on the basis of the classic Cottrell atmosphere formation theory. The mechanism considers (1) JLC ¼ Jd, the carbon flux equilibrium between LC thickening (JLC) and dislocation-assisted carbon migration (Jd), and (2) M0 ¼ MLC þ Mb, the carbon mass conservation of the system, where M0 denotes the total amount of carbon within the system, MLC denotes the amount of carbon within a LC, and Mb denotes the amount of carbon left within the ferrite band, respectively. The solution to these two equations, which addresses the problem that has been puzzling researchers for several decades, makes good predictions on LC thickening rate under various testing conditions. The stress-induced carbide precipitation was examined using high resolution characterisation techniques such as scanning and transmission electron microscopy, obtaining significant evidence to support the postulated theory. The successful description of LC growth implies a potential extension of the theory to other types of stress induced microstructural changes in bearing steels where carbon redistribution occurs. The model presented here provides a more comprehensive understanding of RCF from a microstructural point of view, and thus can enhance the accuracy of traditional bearing life prediction approaches.},

  abstract = {This work presents a simple model for describing the interstitials behavior in solid solutions enlarging the current random interstitial atoms paradigm. A general and parameter-free analytical expression to compute the configurational entropy, valid for any tetrahedral or octahedral interstitial solutions and suitable for the treatment of interstitials clustering, is deduced for that purpose. The effect of interstitials clustering on the configurational entropy is shown by applying the methodology to the Nb-H and bcc Zr-H solid solutions. The model for Nb-H presented in this work, based on the existence of H pairs in the α–phase and double pairs in the α’–phase, provides the basis to explain the unsolved controversies in this system. The unusual shape of the partial configurational entropy measured in bcc Zr-H can be accurately described if a small amount of H clusters are included in the solution.},

  abstract = {Yielding in pure BCC metals and dilute substitutional alloys occurs by doublekink nucleation and propagation along screw dislocations . At low temperatures, the yield stress is controlled by double-kink nucleation. Here, an analytical statistical model is presented to predict the stress- and length-dependent doublekink nucleation barrier in dilute BCC alloys solely in terms of the double-kink process in the pure metal and the solute/screw-dislocation interaction energies in the dilute alloy. Consistent with early literature, dilute alloying always reduces the double-kink nucleation barrier (softening) independent of solutes or matrix. The model is extensively validated via simulations in model Fe-Si alloys described by interatomic potentials. The model is then compared to experiments on real Fe-Si, W-Ta, and W-Re alloys, showing qualitative agreement consistent with the accuracy of the inputs. A cross-over from the dilute limit to the nondilute limit, where there is hardening, is analyzed using the present theory and the non-dilute theory of Maresca et al. The analysis for Fe-Si is consistent with a cross-over at ≈ 2 − 3 at.\%Si, as observed experimentally, and qualitatively consistent with W-Ta and W-Re. The present theory plus the recent theory of Maresca et al. together provide a coherent predictive framework for strengthening of screw dislocations over the full range of concentrations from extremely dilute ( 1 at.\%), to dilute (up to a few at.\%) and non-dilute alloys including High Entropy Alloys.},

  abstract = {The bond-order potential for hcp Ti, constructed in part I, and a central-force Finnis-Sinclair-type potential have been used to study atomistically the core structure of the (1210) screw dislocation. The qualitative features of the core structures are similar in the two cases. The dislocation may either dissociate into Shockley partials on the basal plane or spread in a continuous manner into the prism plane. However, the spreading of the dislocation core into the prism plane is always energetically favoured over the splitting into the basal plane in the case of the bond-order potential whilst the opposite is found in the case of the centralforce Finnis-Sinclair-type potential. Hence, the results obtained using the bondorder potential explain the strong preference for the prism slip over the basal slip in Ti. The most important global parameter is the energy of the intrinsic stacking fault on the basal plane which is so high in the case of the bond-order potential that splitting into Shockley partials is not energetically favourable. The reason for such a high stacking-fault energy is the non-central character of atomic interactions in Ti arising from the significant contribution of d electrons to the bonding, which is correctly captured by the bond-order potential.},

  abstract = {In this work, we examine the kink-nucleation process in BCC screw dislocations using atomistic simulation and transition pathway analysis, with a particular focus on the compact core structure. We observe the existence of a threshold stress, which results in an abrupt change in the minimum energy path of the kink-nucleation process, and hence, a discontinuity in the activation energy versus stress for the process. The magnitude of the discontinuity is found to be related to the degree of metastability of an intermediate split-core structure. This feature appears to be a direct consequence of the so-called ‘camel-hump’ nature of the Peierls potential, which manifests itself in the existence of a metastable, intermediate split-core structure. The effect is observed in a number of empirical EAM potentials, including Fe, Ta, V, Nb and Mo, suggesting a generality to the observations.},

This is due to the long-range character of the elastic fields of dislocations. As a result, the stress field obtained for a doubly periodic array of dislocation dipoles may contain a spurious constant stress that depends on the adopted summation scheme. In the present work, we provide, based on micromechanical considerations, a simple physical explanation of the origin of the conditional convergence of lattice sums of image interactions. In this context, the spurious stresses are found in a closed form for an arbitrary elastic anisotropy, and this is achieved without using the stress field of an individual dislocation. An alternative procedure is also developed where the macroscopic spurious stresses are determined using the solution of the Eshelby's inclusion problem.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that the straightforward application of the nudged elastic band (NEB) method does not determine the correct Peierls barrier of 1/2 1 1 1 screw dislocations in bcc metals. Although this method guarantees that the states (images) of the system are distributed uniformly along the minimum energy path, it does not imply that the dislocation positions are distributed uniformly along this path. In fact, clustering of dislocation positions near potential minima occurs which leads to an overestimate of both the slope of the Peierls barrier and the Peierls stress. We propose a modification in which the NEB method is applied only to a small number of degrees of freedom that determine the position of the dislocation, while all other coordinates of atoms are relaxed by molecular statics as in any atomistic study. This modified NEB method with relaxations gives the Peierls barrier that increases smoothly with the dislocation position and the corresponding Peierls stress agrees well with that evaluated by the direct application of stress in the atomistic modeling of the dislocation glide.},

For this purpose, we introduce the concept of a hypothetical Peierls barrier, which reproduces all the aspects of the dislocation glide at 0 K resulting from the complex response to non-glide stresses expressed in a compact form by the yield criteria advanced in Part II. To achieve this, the barrier is dependent not only on the crystal symmetry and interatomic bonding but also on the applied stress tensor. Standard models are then employed to evaluate the activation enthalpy of kink-pair formation, which is now also a function of the full applied stress tensor. The transition state theory then links this mechanism with the temperature and strain rate dependence of the yield stress.},

  abstract = {The recently formulated constrained nudged elastic band method with atomic relaxations (NEB + r) (Gro¨ ger R, Vitek V. Model Simul Mater Sci Eng 2012;20:035019) is used to investigate the dependence of the Peierls barrier of 1/2h1 1 1i screw dislocations in body-centered cubic metals on non-glide stresses. These are the shear stresses parallel to the slip direction acting in the planes of the h1 1 1i zone different from the slip plane, and the shear stresses perpendicular to the slip direction. Both these shear stresses modify the structure of the dislocation core and thus alter both the Peierls barrier and the related Peierls stress. Understanding of this effect of loading is crucial for the development of mesoscopic models of thermally activated dislocation motion via formation and propagation of pairs of kinks. The Peierls stresses and related choices of the glide planes determined from the Peierls barriers agree with the results of molecular statics calculations (Gro¨ ger R, Bailey AG, Vitek V. Acta Mater 2008;56:5401), which demonstrates that the NEB + r method is a reliable tool for determining the variation in the Peierls barrier with the applied stress. However, such calculations are very time consuming, and it is shown here that an approximate approach of determining the stress dependence of the Peierls barrier (proposed in Gro¨ ger R, Vitek V. Acta Mater 2008;56:5426) can be used, combined with test calculations employing the NEB + r method.},

Using d-valent canonical tight-binding, we compute the moments of the crystal structures of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases as obtained from density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. We apply the moments to establish a measure for the difference between two crystal structures and to characterize volume changes and internal relaxations. The second moment provides access to volume variations of the unit cell and of the atomic coordination polyhedra. Higher moments reveal changes in the longer-ranged coordination shells due to internal relaxations. Normalization of the higher moments leads to constant (A15,C15) or very similar (χ, C14, C36, µ, and σ) higher moments of the DFT-relaxed TCP phases across the 4d and 5d transition-metal series. The identification and analysis of internal relaxations is demonstrated for atomic-size differences in the V-Ta system and for different magnetic orderings in the C14-Fe2Nb Laves phase.},

  abstract = {Carbon solute–dislocation interactions and solute atmospheres for both edge and screw dislocations in body-centered cubic (bcc) iron are computed from first principles using two approaches. First, the distortion tensor and elastic constants entering Eshelby’s model for the segregation of C atoms to a dislocation core in Fe are computed directly using an electronic-structure-based the total energy method. Second, the segregation energy is computed directly via first-principles methods. Comparison of the two methods suggests that the effects of chemistry and magnetism beyond those already reflected in the elastic constants do not make a major contribution to the segregation energy. The resulting predicted solute atmospheres are in good agreement with atom probe measurements.},

Optimization of the parameters of a modified embedded atom potential to a database of density-functional calculations yields an accurate and transferable potential as verified by comparison to experimental and density functional data for phonons, surface and stacking fault energies and energy barriers for homogeneous martensitic transformations. Molecular dynamics simulations map out the pressure-temperature phase diagram of titanium. For this potential the martensitic phase transformation between \$\textbackslash alpha\$ and \$\textbackslash beta\$ appears at ambient pressure and 1200 K, between \$\textbackslash alpha\$ and \$\textbackslash omega\$ at ambient conditions, between \$\textbackslash beta\$ and \$\textbackslash omega\$ at 1200 K and pressures above 8 GPa, and the triple point occurs at 8GPa and 1200 K. Molecular dynamics explorations of the dynamics of the martensitic \$\textbackslash alpha-\textbackslash omega\$ transformation show a fast-moving interface with a low interfacial energy of 30 meV/\textbackslash AA\$\^2\$.

As a check on the correctness of the method we investigate a perfect atomic wire of Cu atoms, and a perfect non-orthogonal chain of H atoms. For both atom chains we find that the conductance has a value of exactly one quantum unit, and that this is rather insensitive to the strength of coupling of the probes to the system, provided values of the coupling are of the same order as the mean inter-level spacing of the system without probes. For the Cu atom chain we find in addition that away from the regions with probes attached, the potential in the wire is uniform, while within them it follows a predicted exponential variation with position. We then apply the method to an initial investigation of the suitability of graphene as a contact material for molecular electronics. We perform calculations on a carbon nanoribbon to determine the correct coupling strength of the probes to the graphene, and obtain a conductance of about two quantum units corresponding to two bands crossing the Fermi surface. We then compute the current through a benzene molecule attached to two graphene contacts and find only a very weak current because of the disruption of the \$\textbackslash pi\$-conjugation by the covalent bond between the benzene and the graphene. In all cases we find that very strong or weak probe couplings suppress the current.},

  abstract = {Stacking fault energy (SFE) plays an important role in the plastic deformation of metals. As compared to those of face-centered cubic metals, the SFEs of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) metals are less reported in literature. In this paper, we derive the expressions of four types (I1, I2, E and T2) of basal plane SFEs of hcp metals in terms of the interlayer interaction energies within the framework of the Ising model. The SFEs of 14 kinds of hcp metals are then evaluated with the interlayer interaction energies extracted from the total energies of four prototypes calculated by using the first-principles full-potential augmented plane-wave method. We show that the hcp metals can be divided into three types according to their interlayer interaction energies. For all the hcp metals involved in this study, I1 has the lowest SFE, whereas E has the highest. The metals (Mg, Co, Zn and Cd) with principal slip system (0 0 0 1)½1 1 2 0 generally have low basal plane SFEs. The I1 and T2 SFEs increase linearly with the energy difference between double hexagonal close-packed and hcp structures, whereas the I2 and E SFEs increase linearly with the energy difference between the short-period twin and hcp structures, indicating a trivial contribution of the interaction energy between atomic layers over third nearest neighbors to the SFEs. The SFEs also correlate with the cohesive energy density (cohesive energy of unit volume) with the exception of Be, Co, Tc and Re.},

An efficient method to correct the effect of the finite size cell used in the first-principles method on the energy of a lattice defect was devised to determine the accurate barrier profile. We find that the migration path is close to a straight line that is confined in a \{1 1 0\} plane and the Peierls barrier profile is single humped. This result clarifies why the existing empirical potentials of bcc iron fail to predict the correct mobility path.

In addition, these results showed that an increase in volume would lead to a decrease in energy; thus, causing an increase in the electrical conduction.},

Algorithms in this field aim to find the optimizer of the function by requesting only a few function evaluations at carefully selected locations. An ideal algorithm should maintain a perfect balance between exploration (probing unexplored areas) and exploitation (focusing on promising areas) within the given evaluation budget. In this paper, we assume the unknown function is Lipschitz continuous. Leveraging the Lipschitz property, we propose an algorithm with a distinct exploration phase followed by an exploitation phase. The exploration phase aims to select samples that shrink the search space as much as possible, while the exploitation phase focuses on the reduced search space and selects samples closest to the optimizer. We empirically show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms.},

  abstract = {Small populations are very desirable for reducing the required computational resources in evolutionary optimization of complex real-world problems. Unfortunately, the search performance of small populations often reduces dramatically in a large search space. To address this problem, a method to find an optimal search dimension for small populations is suggested in this paper. The basic idea is that the evolutionary algorithm starts with a small search dimension and then the search dimension is increased during the optimization. The search dimension will continue to increase if an increase in the search dimension improves the search performance. Otherwise, the search dimension will be decreased and then kept constant. Through empirical studies on a test problem with an infinite search dimension, we show that the proposed algorithm is able to find the search dimension that is the most efficient for the given population size.},

  abstract = {Rietveld refinements of neutron powder diffraction data on a2-Ti3Al have been performed to determine the crystal structure as a function of interstitial oxygen (O) concentration for three alloys with a Ti/Al ratio of z2.34 and O concentrations of 0.25, 3.99, and 7.71\%. The structures of the alloys are hexagonal in space group P63/mmc where Ti and Al atoms populate unique sites with excess Al at the Ti site and O atoms occupy octahedral interstitial sites surrounded by six Ti sites. The length of the c-axis was found to increase linearly as the O occupancy of the interstitial sites increased; this lattice lengthening effect was much less pronounced along the a-axis. Correspondingly, the increases in the lengths of Ti–Al and Ti–Ti bonds with a major component of their direction parallel to the c-axis were roughly an order of magnitude greater than the increases in the lengths of Ti–Al and Ti–Ti bonds more closely aligned with the a-axis. Densities calculated from the lattice parameters and occupancy factors fall in the range (4.118G0.004) to (4.194G0.004) g/cm3, and exhibit a nearly linear increase with oxygen concentration. Measured densities of (4.113G0.001), (4.146G0.009), and (4.191G0.002) g/cm3 for these alloys agree with the results of the refinements.},

  abstract = {The phase diagram of numerous materials of technological importance features high-symmetry high-temperature phases that exhibit phonon instabilities. Leading examples include shape-memory alloys, as well as ferroelectric, refractory, and structural materials. The thermodynamics of these phases have proven challenging to handle by atomistic computational thermodynamic techniques, due to the occurrence of constant anharmonicity-driven hopping between local low-symmetry distortions, while maintaining a high-symmetry time-averaged structure. To compute the free energy in such phases, we propose to explore the system's potential-energy surface by discrete sampling of local minima by means of a lattice gas Monte Carlo approach and by continuous sampling by means of a lattice dynamics approach in the vicinity of each local minimum. Given the proximity of the local minima, it is necessary to carefully partition phase space by using a Voronoi tessellation to constrain the domain of integration of the partition function, in order to avoid double-counting artifacts and enable an accurate harmonic treatment near each local minima. We consider the bcc phase of titanium as a prototypical examples to illustrate our approach.},

It is straightforward to understand that Mg evaporates doubly charged. We also show that MgO þ , MgO2þ , MgO2 þ and O þ ions leave the surface. Two questions are however new for oxides. (1) Where do the electrons go? When the oxides are deposited on a metal tip it can be assumed that the electrons are used to complete the electrical circuit. However this leaves the second question unanswered, namely (2) what happens to the oxygen? We will argue that there are two channels for the oxygen, namely (a) To travel down the (metallic) surface of the tip and eventually to desorb either as atoms or molecules. (b) The oxygen can recombine within the oxide layer itself and desorbs as a neutral molecule accelerated in the inhomogeneous field due to its induced dipole.},

We have also investigated the trapping of up to five hydrogen atoms by a vacancy and the reduction of the vacancy formation energy, due to the formation of a hydrogen–vacancy complex. We used the molecular-dynamics modeling with consecutive relaxation at 0 K to obtain an atomic configuration of the vacancy–impurity complex, corresponding to the global energy minimum. According to our calculations, C–V, H–V, C– (H–V), N–(H–V) complexes are stable in the Al lattice with only H–V complex being stable in Ti. The formation of C–(H–V) and N–(H–V) complexes in the Al lattice results in the negative vacancy formation energy. The formation of H–V complex decreases the vacancy formation energy by 0.26 eV in the Ti lattice. A vacancy in the Ti lattice can trap up to four hydrogen atoms.},

The proposed algorithm is based on an exhaustive search of the ( p − 2)-dimensional space for each component of the nadir point. We compare our algorithm with two earlier studies from the literature. We give numerical results for all algorithms on multiobjective knapsack, assignment and integer linear programming problems. Our algorithm is able to obtain the nadir point for relatively large problem instances with up to five-objectives.},

  abstract = {Disclinations, first observed in mesomorphic phases, are relevant to a number of ill-ordered condensed matter media, with continuous symmetries or frustrated order. They also appear in polycrystals at the edges of grain boundaries. They are of limited interest in solid single crystals, where, owing to their large elastic stresses, they mostly appear in close pairs of opposite signs. The relaxation mechanisms associated with a disclination in its creation, motion, change of shape, involve an interplay with continuous or quantized dislocations and/or continuous disclinations. These are attached to the disclinations or are akin to Nye's dislocation densities, well suited here. The notion of 'extended Volterra process' takes these relaxation processes into account and covers different situations where this interplay takes place. These concepts are illustrated by applications in amorphous solids, mesomorphic phases and frustrated media in their curved habit space. The powerful topological theory of line defects only considers defects stable against relaxation processes compatible with the structure considered. It can be seen as a simplified case of the approach considered here, well suited for media of high plasticity or/and complex structures. Topological stability cannot guarantee energetic stability and sometimes cannot distinguish finer details of structure of defects.},

We present a comprehensive electronic structure investigation of Ti ions, TiO2 molecules and TiO2 bulk crystals, using different density functional theory and wave function-based approaches, which suggests a lower oxidation state (+3). Specifically, there is evidence of a significant remaining contribution from valence s and d electrons of Ti, including the presence of a nuclear cusp around the Ti core. The charge corresponding to valence s and d states of Ti amounts to 1 e. The commonly assumed picture may therefore have to be revised.},

  abstract = {New parametrizations for semiempirical density functional tight binding (DFTB) theory have been developed by the numerical optimization of adjustable parameters to minimize errors in the atomization energy and interatomic forces with respect to ab initio calculated data. Initial guesses for the radial dependences of the SlaterKoster bond integrals and overlap integrals were obtained from minimum basis density functional theory calculations. The radial dependences of the pair potentials and the bond and overlap integrals were represented by simple analytic functions. The adjustable parameters in these functions were optimized by simulated annealing and steepest descent algorithms to minimize the value of an objective function that quantifies the error between the DFTB model and ab initio calculated data. The accuracy and transferability of the resulting DFTB models for the C, H, N, and O system were assessed by comparing the predicted atomization energies and equilibrium molecular geometries of small molecules that were not included in the training data from DFTB to ab initio data. The DFTB models provide accurate predictions of the properties of hydrocarbons and more complex molecules containing C, H, N, and O.},

The migration barriers for the oxygen diffusion between various interstices in the crystal lattice of the Ti-Al alloys are estimated. The preferred migration paths along a and c axes and limiting barriers of the oxygen diffusion in the alloys are determined.

The relative structural stabilities, and the possible phase transformation mechanisms are discussed using results for total energy, electronic structure and elastic constants. We find that the phase transformation form hexagonal to ground state tetragonal structure would take place through a Heusler-like phase which has a pronounced electronic instability. The electronic structures, the elastic constants and the supplementary phonon dispersions indicate that the transition from the Heusler-like to the tetragonal phase is of pure Jahn-Teller origin. We also describe the ground state magnetic structures in each phase by computations of the exchange interactions. For Heusler-like and tetragonal phases, the ferromagnetic exchange interactions associated with the Fe atoms balance the dominating antiferromagnetic interactions between the Mn atoms leading to collinear magnetic structures. In the hexagonal phase, the directions of atomic moments are completely in the planes with a collinear like structure, in stark contrast to the well known non-collinear magnetic structure in the hexagonal phase of Mn3Ga, another material with similar structural properties. The overwhelmingly large exchange interactions of Fe with other magnetic atoms destroy the possibility of magnetic frustration in the hexagonal phase of Mn2FeGa. This comprehensive study provides significant insights into the microscopic physics associated with the structural and magnetic orders in this compound.},

A problem of graphical representation of the Pareto front points arises when the number of objectives is larger than 2 or 3, because, in this case, the Pareto front points are multidimensional. We face the problem of multidimensional data visualization. The visualization strategy proposed is based on a combination of clustering and dimensionality reduction. Moreover, in the obtained projection of the Pareto front points onto a plane, the points are marked according to the Euclidean distance of multidimensional points, corresponding to the points visualized, from the ideal point. In the experimental investigation of the paper, neural gas is used for data clustering, and multidimensional scaling is applied to dimensionality reduction, as well as to visualizing multidimensional data. The strategy can be implemented in a decision support system and it would be useful for a decision maker, who needs to review and evaluate many points of the Pareto fronts, for example, obtained by genetic algorithms.},

These new phenomena allowed one to determine three solution strengthening mechanisms: (I) hindrance of {$<$}a{$>$} prismatic dislocation emission and reconfiguration of 1/3 {$<$}1120{$>$} screw dislocation cores (p type solutes), (II) hindrance of {$<$}a{$>$} prismatic dislocation emission (V) and SFE reduction in other modes (both d type solutes) and (III) suppression of dislocation nucleation in all modes caused by O. We found that the stacking faults formed by the single partial dislocations have a thickness of few atomic layers and exhibit a highly non-uniform structure. Their ability to accommodate the lattice deformation introduced by solute elements greatly affects the stacking fault energies of the a-Ti alloys.},

  abstract = {Alloys containing substitutional solutes exhibit strengthening due to favorable solute fluctuations within the alloy that hinder dislocation motion. Here, a quantitative, parameter-free model to predict the flow stress as a function of temperature and strain rate of such alloys is presented. The model builds on analytic concepts developed by Labusch but introduces key innovations rectifying shortcomings of previous models. To accurately describe the solute/dislocation interaction energies in and around the dislocation core, density functional theory and a flexible-boundary-condition method are used. The model then predicts the zero temperature flow stress, the energy barrier for dislocation motion, and thus the finite temperature flow stresses. The model is used to predict the flow stresses of various Al alloys. Excellent results are obtained for Al–Mg and Al–Mn. Al–Fe with ppm levels of Fe is not predicted well but, using experimental results for Fe, results for the quasi-binary Al–Cr–(Fe) and Al–Cu–(Fe) alloys agree well with experiments. The model is also consistent with the “stress equivalency” postulate of Basinski. This parameter-free model using first-principles input thus provides a basis for achieving the long-sought goal of computational design of alloys, within the context of solute-strengthening mechanisms.},

However, a convincing correlation between deformation and cementite decomposition in pearlite is still absent. In the present work, a local electrode atom probe was used to characterize the microstructural evolution of pearlitic steel, cold-drawn with progressive strains up to 5.4. Transmission electron microscopy was also employed to perform complementary analyses of the microstructure. Both methods yielded consistent results. The overall carbon content in the detected volumes as well as the carbon concentrations in ferrite and cementite were measured by atom probe. In addition, the thickness of the cementite filaments was determined. In ferrite, we found a correlation of carbon concentration with the strain, and in cementite, we found a correlation of carbon concentration with the lamella thickness. Direct evidence for the formation of cell/subgrain boundaries in ferrite and segregation of carbon atoms at these defects was found. Based on these findings, the mechanisms of cementite decomposition are discussed in terms of carbon–dislocation interaction.},

We give analytic expressions for evaluating the charge density, the total energy, the Helmholtz free energy and the atomic forces (including both the Hellmann–Feynman force and the Pulay force) without using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian. We also show how to update the chemical potential without using Kohn–Sham eigenvalues. The advantage of using PEXSI is that it has a computational complexity much lower than that associated with the matrix diagonalization procedure. We demonstrate the performance gain by comparing the timing of PEXSI with that of diagonalization on insulating and metallic nanotubes. For these quasi-1D systems, the complexity of PEXSI is linear with respect to the number of atoms. This linear scaling can be observed in our computational experiments when the number of atoms in a nanotube is larger than a few hundreds. Both the wall clock time and the memory requirement of PEXSI are modest. This even makes it possible to perform Kohn–Sham DFT calculations for 10 000-atom nanotubes with a sequential implementation of the selected inversion algorithm. We also perform an accurate geometry optimization calculation on a truncated (8, 0) boron nitride nanotube system containing 1024 atoms. Numerical results indicate that the use of PEXSI does not lead to loss of the accuracy required in a practical DFT calculation.},

  abstract = {In physics, it is sometimes desirable to compute the so-called Density Of States (DOS), also known as the spectral density, of a real symmetric matrix A. The spectral density can be viewed as a probability density distribution that measures the likelihood of finding eigenvalues near some point on the real line. The most straightforward way to obtain this density is to compute all eigenvalues of A. But this approach is generally costly and wasteful, especially for matrices of large dimension. There exists alternative methods that allow us to estimate the spectral density function at much lower cost. The major computational cost of these methods is in multiplying A with a number of vectors, which makes them appealing for large-scale problems where products of the matrix A with arbitrary vectors are relatively inexpensive. This paper defines the problem of estimating the spectral density carefully, and discusses how to measure the accuracy of an approximate spectral density. It then surveys a few known methods for estimating the spectral density, and proposes some new variations of existing methods. All methods are discussed from a numerical linear algebra point of view.},

The PEXSI technique can be used to evaluate the electron density, free energy, atomic forces, density of states and local density of states without computing any eigenvalue or eigenvector of the Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian. It can achieve accuracy fully comparable to that obtained from a matrix diagonalization procedure for general systems, including metallic systems at low temperature.

The PEXSI-Σ method approximates the density matrix using a set of nearly optimally chosen Green’s functions evaluated at complex frequencies. For each Green’s function, the complex boundary conditions are described by a self energy matrix Σ constructed from a physical reference Green’s function, which can be computed relatively easily. In the linear regime, such treatment of the boundary condition can be numerically exact. The support of the Σ matrix is restricted to degrees of freedom near the boundary of computational domain, and can be interpreted as a frequency dependent surface potential. This makes it possible to perform KSDFT calculations with O(N 2) computational complexity, where N is the number of atoms within the computational domain. Green’s function embedding methods are also naturally compatible with atomistic Green’s function methods for relaxing the atomic configuration outside the computational domain. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the accuracy of the PEXSI-Σ method for graphene with divacancy and dislocation dipole type of defects using the DFTB+ software package.},

  abstract = {Plasticity in steels depends largely on how dislocations interact with solute atoms. We consider here typical interstitial solutes (B, C, N, O) in body-centered cubic (bcc) Fe and show using ab initio calculations that, systematically, when a row of interstitial solutes is in the vicinity of a 1=2h1 1 1i screw dislocation, the dislocation adopts a hard core, forming regular prisms of Fe atoms centered on the solute atoms. This low-energy configuration, previously known only for C atoms, induces attractive dislocation-solute interaction energies ranging from À1.3 to À0.2 eV, depending on the nature of the solutes and their separation distance along the dislocation line. This attractive reconstruction is explained by the larger Voronoi volume of the prismatic sites in the dislocation core compared to bulk octahedral sites. Moreover, an analysis of the local density of states gives a first insight into the chemical contribution responsible for the solute dependence of the interaction energy.},

The two groups are found to display different solute–dislocation interaction behaviors. Group 6 shows a core reconstruction similar to that previously reported in Fe(C): the dislocation adopts a hard-core configuration with the carbon atoms at the center of regular trigonal prisms formed by the metal atoms. The solute–dislocation interaction energies are strongly attractive, ranging from −1.3 to −1.9 eV depending on the metal and the carbon–carbon distance. By way of contrast, the configuration of lowest energy in group 5 consists of the dislocation in its easy core and the carbon atom in a fifth nearest neighbor octahedral site. The configuration is attractive, but less than in group 6. We show that this group dependence is consistent with the carbon local environment in the stable stoichiometric carbide structures, namely cubic NaCl-type for group 5 and hexagonal WC-type for group 6: in both cases the carbon atoms are at the center of octahedra and prisms respectively.},

  abstract = {The equilibrium segregation of carbon atoms in the core of screw dislocations in body-centred cubic Fe is modelled using a generalized Ising model parametrized on density functional theory calculations and solved using both mean-field calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. Recently, a strong carbon-dislocation attraction was evidenced, resulting in a spontaneous reconstruction of the dislocation core towards a hard core configuration, where the carbon atom is located at the centre of a regular trigonal prism called a prismatic site. Here we show that the fourth neighbour octahedral sites of the reconstructed core are also attractive for carbon with a binding energy similar to that of the prismatic core site reported previously. This suggests that the dislocation may be decorated by lines of carbon atoms on both types of sites. Moreover, all carbon–carbon interactions including intra-line and inter-line interactions, are found repulsive. Segregation therefore results from a competition between the dislocation-carbon attraction and the carbon–carbon repulsion, leading to complex ordering phenomena that are analysed here in detail. Notably, we evidence a high temperature regime, in the regime of dynamical strain ageing of steels, where the prismatic line is half-occupied on average with every other prismatic site occupied by a carbon atom while the octahedral lines are empty. The iso-concentrations for the prismatic and octahedral lines obtained with the mean-field approach and with Monte Carlo simulations are qualitatively similar.},

  abstract = {Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is a general purpose optimisation algorithm used to address hard optimisation problems. The algorithm operates as a result of a number of particles converging on what is hoped to be the best solution. How the particles move through the problem space is therefore critical to the success of the algorithm. This study utilizes meta optimisation to compare a number of velocity update equations to determine which features of each are of benefit to the algorithm. A number of hybrid velocity update equations are proposed based on other high performing velocity update equations. This research also presents a novel application of PSO to train a neural network function approximator to address the Watershed Management problem. It is found that the standard PSO with a linearly changing inertia, the proposed hybrid Attractive Repulsive PSO with Avoidance of Worst Locations (AR PSOAWL) and Adaptive Velocity PSO (AV PSO) provide the best performance overall. The results presented in this paper also reveal that commonly used PSO parameters do not provide the best performance. Increasing and negative inertia values were found to perform better.},

Internal stresses are often encountered in steel microstructures and are known to affect the diffusivity of carbon. The effect of pressure on carbon diffusivity is related to the carbon migration volume. Unfortunately, theoretical and experimental studies on this migration volume are scarce and sometimes contradictory with one another. In this paper, we provide new ab initio results on carbon migration and compute the effect of an applied pressure on diffusivity. Our results are consistent with known crystallographic and relaxation data. They show that carbon diffusivity in bcc-iron can be enhanced by applying compressive pressure, a counterintuitive and unusual effect in steels.},

The diffraction data contain Bragg peaks and additional features in the form of Bragg rods, which are related to the stacking of the hexagonally close-packed layers. The profile of the Bragg rod shows distinct intensity modulations which, under the specific experimental conditions used here, are directly related to the stacking sequence of the layers. Using a model for the scattered intensity along the Bragg rod for an exact stacking sequence of a finite number of hexagonally close-packed layers, it is found that a double hexagonal close-packed stacking sequence is present in the colloidal crystal grain. This analysis method opens up ways to obtain crucial structural information from finite-sized crystalline samples by employing advanced third-generation X-ray sources.},

  abstract = {Two procedures were developed to fit interatomic potentials of the embeddedatom method (EAM) form and applied to determine a potential which describes crystalline and liquid iron. While both procedures use perfect crystal and crystal defect data, the first procedure also employs the first-principles forces in a model liquid and the second procedure uses experimental liquid structure factor data. These additional types of information were incorporated to ensure more reasonable descriptions of atomic interactions at small separations than is provided using standard approaches, such as fitting to the universal binding energy relation. The new potentials (provided herein) are, on average, in better agreement with the experimental or first-principles lattice parameter, elastic constants, point-defect energies, bcc–fcc transformation energy, liquid density, liquid structure factor, melting temperature and other properties than other existing EAM iron potentials.},

  abstract = {Manganese and nickel solute atoms in irradiated ferritic steels play a major role in the nanostructural evolution of reactor pressure vessels (RPV), as they are responsible for the formation of embrittling nanofeatures even in the absence of copper. The stability and mobility of small vacancy-solute clusters is here studied with an atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo approach based on ab initio calculations, in order to investigate the influence of Mn and Ni on the early life of small radiation-induced vacancy clusters, and to provide the necessary parameters for advanced object kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the RPV long-term nanostructural evolution. Migration barriers are obtained by direct ab initio calculations or through a binding energy model based on ab initio data. Our results show a clear immobilizing and stabilizing effect on vacancy clusters as the solute content is increased, whereas the only evident difference between the two solute species is a somewhat longer elongation of the cluster mean free path in the presence of a few Mn atoms.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a recently developed full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital (FP-LMTO) method which does not require empty spheres and can calculate the forces accurately. Similar to previous approaches, this method uses numerical integration to calculate the matrix elements for the interstitial potential, which is the limiting step for any FP-LMTO approach. However, in order to reduce the numerical effort as far as possible, we use a newly introduced basis consisting of “augmented smooth Hankel functions” which play the role of the LMTO envelope functions. After presenting the basics of the approach, we report the results of numerical test for typical condensed-matter systems. The calculations show that good accuracy can be reached with an almost minimal basis set. These features of the method open the way to efficient molecular dynamics studies and simulated-annealing calculations to optimize structures while retaining the advantages of the LMTO method.},

  abstract = {Anomalous thermal expansion behaviour of several open frame-work compounds has been extensively investigated using the techniques of inelastic neutron scattering and lattice dynamics. These compounds involve increasing level of structural complexity and flexibility, which leads to increased values of thermal expansion coefficients approaching colossal values. In several compounds, neutron inelastic scattering experiments have produced quantitative estimates of the anharmonicity of phonons over a range of low energies, and thereby explained the observed thermal expansion quantitatively. The anharmonicity is found to be an order of magnitude larger than that in usual materials. Lattice dynamical calculations have correctly predicted the observed anharmonicity in the neutron experiments and revealed the overall nature of phonons involved. In compounds showing negative thermal expansion, the phonons responsible have rather low energies up to 10 meV. In most compounds, the anharmonic phonons span all over the Brillouin zone, while in some cases the specific phonons are limited to certain wave-vectors. The nature of specific phonons responsible for anomalous behavior is found to be different in all these compounds. These phonons generally involve transverse vibrations, librations and internal distortions of the polyhedral units. The paper reviews recent advances in the understanding of anomalous thermal expansion behaviour.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen embrittlement of lath martenistic steels is characterized by intergranular and ―quasicleavage‖ transgranular fracture. Recent transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses (Nagao et al., 2012a, 2014a, 2014b, 2014c) of samples lifted from beneath fracture surfaces through focused ion beam machining (FIB) revealed a failure mechanism that can be termed hydrogen-enhanced-plasticity mediated decohesion. Fracture occurs by the synergistic action of the hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity and decohesion. In particular, intergranular cracking takes place by dislocation pile-ups impinging on prior austenite grain boundaries and quasicleavage is the case when dislocation pile-ups impinge on block boundaries. These high-angle boundaries, which have already weakened by the presence of hydrogen, debond by the pile-up stresses. The micromechanical model of Novak et al. (2010) is used to quantitatively describe and predict the hydrogen-induced failure of these steels. The model predictions verify that introduction of nanosized (Ti,Mo)C precipitates in the steel microstructure enhances the resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. The results are used to discuss microstructural designs that are less susceptible to hydrogen-induced failure in systems with fixed hydrogen content (closed systems).},

  abstract = {The mobility of dislocation in body-centered cubic (BCC) metals is controlled by the thermally activated nucleation of kinks along the dislocation core. By employing a recent interatomic potential and the Nudged Elastic Band method, we predict the atomistic saddle-point state of 1=2〈111〉 screw dislocation motion in BCC iron that involves the nucleation of correlated kinkpairs and the resulting double superkinks. This unique process leads to a single-humped minimum energy path that governs the one-step activation of a screw dislocation to move into the adjacent f110g Peierls valley, which contrasts with the double-humped energy path and the two-step transition predicted by other interatomic potentials. Based on transition state theory, we use the atomistically computed, stress-dependent kinkpair activation parameters to inform a coarse-grained crystal plasticity flow rule. Our atomistically-informed crystal plasticity model quantitatively predicts the orientation dependent stress–strain behavior of BCC iron single crystals in a manner that is consistent with experimental results. The predicted temperature and strain-rate dependencies of the yield stress agree with experimental results in the 200–350 K temperature regime, and are rationalized by the small activation volumes associated with the kinkpair-mediated motion of screw dislocations.},

  abstract = {The bond-order potentials (BOPs) idea employs the orthogonal two-centre tight-binding (TB) representation for the bond energy and the Harris–Foulkes approximation for the repulsive pairwise contribution. In the last ten years, although many efforts have been focused on theoretical calculations of the bond order expression, the BOPs still suffers from the uncertainty of how best to choose the semi-empirical TB parameters that enter the scheme. In this paper, we review recent developments to obtain the reliable and transferable BOPs which help to extend the accuracy and applicability to technologically important multicomponent systems. Firstly, we have found that a simple pair potential is unsuitable for describing the environmental screening effects due to the s and p orbital overlap repulsion in transition metal alloys and therefore the inability to reproduce the negative Cauchy pressures exhibiting in strong covalent systems. By adding the environmental dependent repulsive term, the Cauchy pressure problem has been removed and we are now able to get the BOPs for studying dislocations, extended defects and mechanical properties of hightemperature intermetallic Ti–Al alloys. In particular, new results on the core structures and possible dissociation of different type of dislocations will be discussed. Secondly, we present the first derivation of explicit analytic expressions for environmental dependence of σ, π and δ bond integrals by inverting the non-orthogonal matrix. We illustrate the power of this new formalism by showing that it not only captures the transferability of bond integrals between Mo, Si and MoSi2 but also predicts the large discontinuities between first and second nearest neighbours for ppσ, ppπ and ddπ even though absence of any discontinuity for the ddσ bond integral. A new environmentally dependent BOPs has been developed for bcc-Mo indicating that the core structure of 1/2〈 111〉 screw dislocations is narrower than structures found in previous studies in agreement with recent ab initio calculations. Finally, the new formalism will allow us to study the problem of medium range order found recently in amorphous materials with covalent bonding at large and realistic nanoscale. For the case of a-C where the issue of sp2 vs sp3 is very crucial for modelling amorphous structure we found that the σ and π bond integrals are not only transferable between graphite and diamond structures but they are also strongly anisotropic due to inter-plan bonding between graphite sheets.},

Cross-slip nucleation in FCC solid solution alloys has recently been shown to be strongly influenced by local fluctuations in spatial arrangement of solutes, leading to a statistical distribution of cross-slip nucleation barriers. For cross-slip to be effective macroscopically, however, small cross-slip nuclei (\textasciitilde 40b) must expand across the entire length of typical dislocation segments (102–103b). Here, a model is developed to compute the relevant activation energy distribution for cross-slip in a random FCC alloy over arbitrary lengths and under non-zero Escaig and Schmid stresses. The model considers cross-slip as a random walk of successive flips of adjacent1b segments, with each flip having an energy consisting of a deterministic contribution due to constriction formation and stress effects, plus a stochastic contribution. The corresponding distribution is computed analytically from solute-dislocation and solute-solute binding energies. At zero stress, the probability of high activation energies increases with dislocation length. However, at stresses of just a few MPa, these barriers are eliminated and lower barriers are dominant. For increasing segment length, the effective energy barrier decreases according to a weak-link scaling relationship and good analytic predictions can be made using only known material properties. Overall, these results show that the effective cross-slip barrier in a random alloy is significantly lower than estimates based on average elastic and stacking fault properties of the alloy.},

  abstract = {The five independent elastic constants of hexagonal monocrystal titanium were determined up to the phase-transformation temperature, and the two isotropic elastic constants of polycrystalline titanium were determined beyond, up to 1300 K. Anomalous temperature dependences were observed just below the phase-transformation temperature: C11 and C66 increase with increasing temperature whereas C33 and C44 remarkably decrease, for example. To determine the Cij, we used the free-vibration resonance frequencies obtained by electromagnetic acoustic resonance.

  abstract = {The five independent elastic constants of hexagonal monocrystal titanium were determined up to the phase-transformation temperature, and the two isotropic elastic constants of polycrystalline titanium were determined beyond, up to 1300 K. Anomalous temperature dependences were observed just below the phase-transformation temperature: C11 and C66 increase with increasing temperature whereas C33 and C44 remarkably decrease, for example. To determine the Cij, we used the free-vibration resonance frequencies obtained by electromagnetic acoustic resonance. After the phase transformation, the resonance frequencies changed little with the temperature increase, showing that the bcc-phase elastic constants change little with temperature. The polycrystalline elastic constants remained unchanged up to 1300 K after the phase transformation. The anomalous temperature dependence near the transformation is interpreted in terms of the small c=a ratio of the hcp phase and change of the atomic distances to meet the Burgers lattice relationship.

The formalism of the linearised muffin-tin orbital (LMTO) method is revisited in detail and developed further by the introduction of short-ranged tight-binding basis functions for full-potential calculations. The LMTO method is presented in both Green’s function and wave function formulations for bulk and layered systems. The suite’s full-potential LMTO code uses a sophisticated basis and augmentation method that allows an efficient and precise solution to the band problem at different levels of theory, most importantly density functional theory, LDA+U , quasi-particle self-consistent GW and combinations of these with dynamical mean field theory. This paper details the technical and theoretical bases of these methods, their implementation in Questaal, and provides an overview of the code’s design and capabilities.},

  abstract = {Many institutions are now developing large-scale, complex, coupled multiphysics computational simulations for massively parallel platforms for the simulation of the performance of nuclear weapons and certification of the stockpile, and for research in climate and weather prediction, magnetic and inertial fusion energy, environmental systems, astrophysics, aerodynamic design, combustion, biological and biochemical systems, and other areas. The successful development of these simulations is aided by attention to sound software project management and software engineering. We have developed “lessons learned” from a set of code projects that the Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Agency has sponsored to develop nuclear weapons simulations over the last 50 years. We find that some, but not all, of the software project management and development practices (rather than processes) commonly employed for non-technical software add value to the development of scientific software and we identify those that we judge add value. Another key finding, consistent with general software industry experience, is that the optimal project schedule and resource level are solely determined by the requirements once the requirements are fixed.},

Compared with the substitutional atoms such as Al, there is a large repulsive interaction between oxygen interstitials at the octahedral site and an {$<$}a{$>$}-type screw dislocation core, since the volume for the interstitial atom between Ti lattice sites is largely reduced in the core. Differential displacement maps and distributions of interstitial volume surrounding the dislocation core show that the interaction with an oxygen interstitial is very short ranged (\textasciitilde{} 5 Angstrom) and directional, mainly located on the prismatic plane where the majority of lattice displacements in the {$<$}a{$>$} screw dislocation core occurs. At long distances the interactions mediated by the strain from the interstitial oxygen and the dislocation vanish. We show that the large repulsive interaction at short range can push an oxygen atom from its original interstitial site to a new interstitial site on the basal plane in the dislocation core. The strong repulsive interaction and the mechanical shuffle of oxygen interstitials can be expected to have a large impact on dislocation dynamics, and can be used to explain the strong strengthening effects of oxygen impurities in alpha-titanium observed experimentally.},

  abstract = {Optimization is a method of finding the optimum solution i.e. finding the maximum or minimum of a given objectives, subjected to various constraints. In the literature, various advanced optimization techniques are available out of which particle swarm optimization is one of the advanced optimization technique. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an efficient optimization method. Like other algorithm PSO is also population based algorithm. The PSO is inspired by the metaphor of social interaction observed between fishes or birds. In a PSO algorithm, each particle is a candidate solution and each particle “flies” through the search space, depending on two important factors; the best position the current particle have found so far and the global best position identified from the entire population. PSO has been used in many fields such as in aerospace design, manufacturing, heat transfer and automobile. In the present work PSO algorithm is applied on standard benchmark functions such as Rastrigin function, problem with equality and inequality constraints. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied on different Benchmark function for tunning various parameters like inertia weight, social parameter and cognitive parameter. Results obtained by particle swarm optimization algorithm are compared with results of previous work and it is observed that the results obtained by PSO algorithm are better than the previous result.},

Of the sixteen possible ways in which Ti, Zr and Al atoms can be arranged, in the lattice sites corresponding to D019 structure of Ti3Al, to obtain Ti2ZrAl, it is shown that Zr atoms prefer to get substituted at the Ti sites. It is further shown that among the seven crystal structures considered, D0 19-like and L1 2-like are the competing ground-state structures of Ti2ZrAl. The above results are in agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature. Calculated values of equilibrium lattice parameters, heat of formation and bulk modulus of Ti2ZrAl are presented. The basis for the structural stability and bonding are analysed in terms of the density of states. Between the two possible B2like structures, Ti2ZrAl shows enhanced stability for the one where Zr is substituted in the Ti sublattice, which again is in agreement with the experimental observation.},

We present the first completely theoretical prediction of the temperature- and pressure-dependence of the hcp-ω phase transformation and show that it is in good agreement with experiment. The quasi-harmonic approximation fails to adequately treat the bcc phase because the zero-temperature phonons of this structure are not all stable.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory and ab initio thermodynamics studies are performed to investigate the interaction of oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen molecules with hexagonal close packed Ti (0001) surfaces. The system is modeled as a slab where the concentration of the adsorbed atoms is systematically increased and the most favorable configuration is determined based on total energy comparisons. Varying tendencies are observed for the ground state structures of oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen adsorption. Oxygen and hydrogen atoms are found to be adsorbed on the surface with increasing concentration and tend to migrate to interior layer only after surface saturation. However, nitrogen prefers to migrate into the interior layers. For all elements, the favorable position in the interior layers is the octahedral interstitial site. Taking into account the partial pressure of oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen and the effect of temperature, we develop surface phase diagrams that display stable surface configurations. Our studies provide an atomic insight into the structure of the surface scale, passivation effects, and surface tension of Ti for advanced powder manufacturing processes and applications in catalysis.},

  abstract = {During hot component fatigue tests there have been two cases of low life crack initiation of gas turbine rotating parts manufactured from the Titanium alloy Ti-6246. Both exhibited a small (\textasciitilde 0.1 mm) elliptical ‘blue spot’ at the origin. Through validated striation count work and fracture mechanics it was established that fatigue had propagated with a near-nil initiation life. Early investigation suggested that the ‘blue spot’ was possibly a region of stage 1 fatigue growth, and was therefore a material behaviour concern with potential implications for service. During an investigation of a later cracking incident in this alloy, subsequently shown to have resulted from stress-corrosion cracking (SCC), near-identical fractographic characteristics to that seen in the “blue spot” were found that subtly differentiated it from stage 1 fatigue. Also, similar ‘blue spots’ have since been identified on Ti6246 Laboratory hot LCF test specimens and found to have been due to contamination by NaCl, through the application of focussed long-term EDX examination and other novel chemical analyses techniques. By the application of those techniques, fractography, and comparison against these specimens, Rolls-Royce and Imperial College London have collaborated to show that the original two component ‘blue spots’ were subtle examples of NaCl-related Hot Salt Stress-Corrosion Cracking (HSSCC). Such cracking has not been found to occur in service components, due to air pressure within the engine, and the effect is therefore confined to Laboratory and component tests at near-atmospheric pressure or below.},

We define a structural importance metric which we refer to as le, based on perturbing the adjacency matrix and observing the resultant change in eigenvalue. We then propose a model for network evolution where this metric can control the probabilities of subsequent edge changes. Experiments on networks generated according to our model, and real financial and social networks show that i) a perturbation based approximation of le is effective in the case of isolated changes ii) network evolution can be parameterised by the extent to which le influences the propensity and scale of changes, and iii) predictability of change from the value of le can be understood from these parameters. These methods have application in financial regulation whereby it is important to understand how individual changes to systems will impact the global behaviour. It also provides fundamental insights into spectral predictability in networks, and demonstrates how spectral perturbations can be a useful tool in understanding the interplay between micro and macro features of networks.},

  abstract = {The deformation and failure response of many polycrystalline metallic materials is strongly dependent on the strain-rate. For an applied strain-rate, different points in the material microstructure can undergo strain-rates that differ by orders of magnitude depending on location and deformation history. Dislocation motion in metals is governed by the thermally-activated and drag-dominated processes under low and high rates of deformation, respectively. Commonly used flow rules, e.g the phenomenological power law or the linear viscous drag models are generally applicable to a limited range of strain-rates, without transcending these rates. To enable this transition in a seamless manner, this two part paper develops a unified constitutive model and an image-based crystal plasticity finite element model for polycrystalline hcp metals. The first part develops a dislocation density-based crystal plasticity constitutive relation with a unified flow rule by combining the thermally-activated and drag-dominated stages of dislocation slip, suitable for modeling deformation at a wide range of strain-rates. The model is explicitly temperaturedependent, making it appropriate for simulating high rate deformations, where temperature increases locally with plastic deformation due to the adiabatic heating. The unified model is used to study rate-sensitivity of flow stress in single crystal and polycrystalline titanium alloy, Ti-7Al. An elastic overshoot, followed by a stress relaxation is observed at high strain-rates in single crystals. For the polycrystalline simulations, the model effectively captures the increase in rate sensitivity at high strain-rates.},

  abstract = {Solute–vacancy binding is a key quantity in understanding diffusion kinetics, and may also have a considerable impact on the hardening response in Mg alloys. However, the binding energetics between solute impurities and vacancies in Mg are notoriously difficult to measure accurately and are largely unknown. Here, we present a large database of solute–vacancy binding energies in Mg from first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. Our vacancy formation energy and dilute mixing energy, which are byproducts of the solute–vacancy binding calculations, show good agreement with experiments, where available. We have investigated the simple physical effects controlling solute–vacancy binding in Mg and find that there is a modest correlation between binding energy and solute size, with larger solute atoms more favorably binding with neighboring vacancies to relax the strain induced by the solutes. Most early 3d transition metal solutes do not favorably bind with vacancies, indicating that a simple bond-counting argument is not sufficient to explain the trends in binding, in contrast to the case of binding in Al. We also predict positive vacancy binding energies for some commonly used microalloying elements in Mg which are known to improve age hardenability, i.e. Na, In, Zn, Ag and Ca. Even larger vacancy binding energies are found for some other solutes (e.g. Cu, Sn, Pb, Bi and Pt), which await experimental validation.},

  abstract = {We address the role of hydrogen in modifying the behaviour of screw dislocations in a-iron under the influence of the tensile and compressive stresses that are expected to arise in the vicinity of a crack tip. The quantum mechanical tight binding approximation is employed to calculate the variation of the hydrogen/screw dislocation interaction with strain. The locations and binding energies of hydrogen trap-sites surrounding the unstrained core are shown to be of similar accuracy to previous ab-initio results. Bi-axial tension and compression is applied normal to the dislocation line; the binding energies are found to vary linearly with strain. Estimations of the effect of hydrogen in strained regions are made based on the proposition that hydrogen may both enhance the nucleation of kink-pairs by lowering the formation energy, and slow the movement of kinks by a solute drag effect. Our results suggest that these effects will be enhanced in tensile regions. The chance of hardening by the collision of crossed kinks, to form a jog, is estimated by comparing the nucleation and annihilation rate of kinks on a straight screw dislocation for a range of hydrogen concentrations and temperatures, suggesting a greatly increased incidence with tension that is accentuated at lower temperatures.},

  abstract = {The use of machine learning algorithms frequently involves careful tuning of learning parameters and model hyperparameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a “black art” requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes bruteforce search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm’s generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expertlevel performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

  abstract = {Machine learning algorithms frequently require careful tuning of model hyperparameters, regularization terms, and optimization parameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a "black art" that requires expert experience, unwritten rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. Much more appealing is the idea of developing automatic approaches which can optimize the performance of a given learning algorithm to the task at hand. In this work, we consider the automatic tuning problem within the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). The tractable posterior distribution induced by the GP leads to efficient use of the information gathered by previous experiments, enabling optimal choices about what parameters to try next. Here we show how the effects of the Gaussian process prior and the associated inference procedure can have a large impact on the success or failure of Bayesian optimization. We show that thoughtful choices can lead to results that exceed expert-level performance in tuning machine learning algorithms. We also describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization on a diverse set of contemporary algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

  abstract = {We describe a novel method for extracting dislocation lines from atomistic simulation data in a fully automated way. The dislocation extraction algorithm (DXA) generates a geometric description of dislocation lines contained in an arbitrary crystalline model structure. Burgers vectors are determined reliably, and the extracted dislocation network fulfills the Burgers vector conservation rule at each node. All remaining crystal defects (grain boundaries, surfaces, etc), which cannot be represented by one-dimensional dislocation lines, are output as triangulated surfaces. This geometric representation is ideal for visualization of complex defect structures, even if they are not related to dislocation activity. In contrast to the recently proposed on-the-fly dislocation detection algorithm (ODDA) Stukowski (2010 Modelling Simul. Mater. Sci. Eng. 18 015012) the new method is extremely robust. While the ODDA was designed for a computationally efficient on-the-fly analysis, the DXA method enables a detailed analysis of dislocation lines even in highly distorted crystal regions, as they occur, for instance, close to grain boundaries or in dense dislocation networks.},

  abstract = {The line tension Γ of a dislocation is an important and fundamental property ubiquitous to continuum scale models of metal plasticity. However, the precise value of Γ in a given material has proven difficult to assess, with literature values encompassing a wide range. Here results from a multiscale simulation and robust analysis of the dislocation line tension, for dislocation bow-out between pinning points, are presented for two widelyused interatomic potentials for Al. A central part of the analysis involves an effective Peierls stress applicable to curved dislocation structures that markedly differs from that of perfectly straight dislocations but is required to describe the bow-out both in loading and unloading. The line tensions for the two interatomic potentials are similar and provide robust numerical values for Al. Most importantly, the atomic results show notable differences with singular anisotropic elastic dislocation theory in that (i) the coefficient of the ln(L) scaling with dislocation length L differs and (ii) the ratio of screw to edge line tension is smaller than predicted by anisotropic elasticity. These differences are attributed to local dislocation core interactions that remain beyond the scope of elasticity theory. The many differing literature values for Γ are attributed to various approximations and inaccuracies in previous approaches. The results here indicate that continuum line dislocation models, based on elasticity theory and various core-cut-off assumptions, may be fundamentally unable to reproduce full atomistic results, thus hampering the detailed predictive ability of such continuum models.},

  abstract = {The elastic properties of single-crystalline x (hexagonal) phase of titanium are studied. Understanding the elastic properties is important for the development of biomedical titanium alloys with a low Young’s modulus. However, the elastic properties of the x phase have remained unclear because of the difficulty in preparing a large single crystal consisting of a single phase of the x phase, even though the x phase has been believed to exhibit a higher elastic modulus than the b (body-centered cubic) phase. In this work, pure titanium was severely deformed by high-pressure torsion processing, to obtain polycrystalline specimens consisting exclusively of the x phase, which is metastable at room temperature. For the x-phase polycrystal, the complete set of elastic stiffness components was measured by RUS combined with laser Doppler interferometery. By analyzing the elastic stiffness of the x-phase polycrystal on the basis of an inverse Voigt–Reuss–Hill approximation, the elastic stiffness components of the single-crystalline x phase were determined. The Young’s modulus of the x phase along h0001i was found to be clearly higher than that along h1 1 2 0i, and the shear modulus also exhibited anisotropy. Importantly, the Young’s modulus and shear modulus of the metastable x phase were higher than those of the b phase and also higher than those of the a (hexagonal close-packed) phase, which is stable at room temperature. Furthermore, analysis by a micromechanics model using the determined elastic stiffness deduced the effect of x phase formation on the elastic properties of b-phase titanium alloys.

  abstract = {A model for ionic and electronic grain boundary transport through thin films, scales or membranes with columnar grain structure is introduced. The grain structure is idealized as a lattice of identical hexagonal cells e a honeycomb pattern. Reactions with the environment constitute the boundary conditions and drive the transport between the surfaces. Time-dependent simulations solving the Poisson equation selfconsistently with the Nernst-Planck flux equations for the mobile species are performed. In the resulting Poisson-Nernst-Planck system of equations, the electrostatic potential is obtained from the Poisson equation in its integral form by summation. The model is used to interpret alumina membrane oxygen permeation experiments, in which different oxygen gas pressures are applied at opposite membrane surfaces and the resulting flux of oxygen molecules through the membrane is measured. Simulation results involving four mobile species, charged aluminum and oxygen vacancies, electrons, and holes, provide a complete description of the measurements and insight into the microscopic processes underpinning the oxygen permeation of the membrane. Most notably, the hypothesized transition between p-type and n-type ionic conductivity of the alumina grain boundaries as a function of the applied oxygen gas pressure is observed in the simulations. The range of validity of a simple analytic model for the oxygen permeation rate, similar to the Wagner theory of metal oxidation, is quantified by comparison to the numeric simulations. The three-dimensional model we develop here is readily adaptable to problems such as transport in a solid state electrode, or corrosion scale growth.},

Then, after an explanation of the mechanical meaning of the anisotropic elastic constants, the key topic of elastic symmetries is treated in detail. The technical elastic constants are then introduced as well as the elastic bounds for the components of the elastic tensor and for the technical constants. After an observation on the decomposition of the strain energy for anisotropic bodies, the Chapter ends with the determination of the symmetry planes, the curvilinear anisotropy and some examples of typical anisotropic materials.},

The spatial carbon distributions around the line defects revealed that the Cottrell atmosphere associated with an edge dislocation is denser than that around a screw dislocation, in contrast with the predictions of the classical model of Cochardt and colleagues.

For this purpose, molecular statics with an Fe–C interatomic potential, based on the embedded atom method, has been employed. Results of these simulations have been compared to the predictions of anisotropic elasticity theory. The agreement is better for a carbon atom sitting on an octahedral site (energy minimum) than one on a tetrahedral site (saddle point). Absolute differences in the energy barriers obtained by the two methods are usually below 5 meV at distances larger than 1.5 nm from a screw dislocation and 2 nm (up to 4 nm in the glide plane) from the edge dislocation. Atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations performed at T = 300 K and additional analysis based on the activation energies obtained by both methods show that they are in good qualitative agreement, despite some important quantitative discrepancies due to the large absolute errors found near the dislocation cores.},

The methodology for constructing simulation cells with fully periodic boundary conditions based on the quadrupolar arrangement of dislocation dipoles, with a single kink on each dislocation line is presented. The two types of kinks – left and right – are found to have similar widths, namely \$20 Burgers vectors. The convergences of the formation energies with cell-size along the dislocation line, as well as with the distance between the two dislocations are investigated. A dependence proportional to the inverse of the distance between kinks along the dislocation line is found when kinks overlap. The formation energies of the left and right kinks are significantly different: 0.57 and 0.08 eV, respectively. The Peierls potentials of the second kind are evaluated with the drag method: the energy barriers are found to be lower than 0.1 meV for both kinks.},

  abstract = {Computer modelling is at present as important method of the study of materials and their properties as experiments. Yet, experiments have been being performed for several thousands years while computer modelling started about fifty years ago. In this introductory paper we first present a historical account of the advancement of computer modelling. Since defects in crystalline materials control most of their properties but their atomic level structure and properties cannot be treated analytically, they provided the impetus for the advancement of computer modelling in materials science. In between the plethora of defects we concentrate here on dislocations since it was established via modelling that it is the non-planarity of the cores of screw dislocations in BCC metals which controls their plastic properties. This understanding than lead to the recognition that the non-planarity of dislocation cores is common in many materials and frequently determines their properties. This atomic level aspect of dislocations is considered in more details, not only for the BCC metals, and relation to the macroscopic plastic behaviour discussed. Computer modelling plays, of course, important role in studies of many other defects, such as interfaces, surfaces, irradiation induced defects etc., as well as glasses and liquids, and the last part of the paper is devoted to discussing the possible future developments, in particular from the point of view of available descriptions of atomic interactions that are the precursor of any atomistic modelling.},

  abstract = {Much work has recently been reported in parallel GPU-based particle swarm optimization (PSO). Motivated by the encouraging results of these investigations, while also recognizing the limitations of GPU-based methods for big problems using a large amount of data, this paper explores the efficacy of employing other types of parallel hardware for PSO. Most commodity systems feature a variety of architectures whose high-performance capabilities can be exploited. In this paper, high-dimensional problems and those that employ a large amount of external data are explored within the context of heterogeneous systems. Large problems are decomposed into constituent components, and analyses are undertaken of which components would benefit from multi-core or GPU parallelism. The current study therefore provides another demonstration that “supercomputing on a budget” is possible when subtasks of large problems are run on hardware most suited to these tasks. Experimental results show that large speedups can be achieved on high dimensional, data-intensive problems. Cost functions must first be analysed for parallelization opportunities, and assigned hardware based on the particular task.},

One major impact is that solute atoms can affect both kink formation and motion during screw dislocation gliding, which plays an important role in plastic behavior of bcc metals. In this study, atomistic simulations are conducted on the carbon-affected kinking of a screw dislocation in iron using the nudged elastic band method. When kink nucleates alongside a carbon atom, the kink formation energy decreases as the carbon transits to a stronger binding site, and vice versa. When a single kink meets the carbon during propagation, the sideward motion of the kink is impeded. With regard to the different temperatures and solute concentrations, the softening and hardening effects induced by carbon solutes in iron can be explained by the complex atomistic process.},

  abstract = {In the example of oxygen diffusion in dilute ferritic iron alloys it is shown that the calculation of the diffusion coefficient can be separated into a contribution related to the migration in the interaction region between oxygen and the substitutional solute and a part related to diffusion in pure body centered cubic (bcc) Fe. The corresponding diffusion times are determined by analytical expressions using Density-Functional-Theory (DFT) data for the respective binding energies. The diffusion coefficient in the interaction region must be determined by atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo (AKMC) simulations with DFT values for the migration barriers as input data. In contrast to previous calculations, AKMC simulation must only be performed for one concentration of the substitutional solute, and the obtained results can be employed to obtain data for other concentrations in a very efficient manner. This leads to a tremendous decrease of computational efforts. Under certain conditions it is even possible to use analytical expressions where merely DFT data for the binding energies are needed. The limits of applicability of the presented calculation procedures are discussed in detail. The methods presented in this work can be generalized to interstitial diffusion in other host materials with small concentrations of substitutional solutes.},

  abstract = {Previous efforts to understand solute–vacancy binding in aluminum alloys have been hampered by a scarcity of reliable, quantitative experimental measurements. Here, we report a large database of solute–vacancy binding energies determined from first-principles density functional calculations. The calculated binding energies agree well with accurate measurements where available, and provide an accurate predictor of solute–vacancy binding in other systems. We find: (i) some common solutes in commercial Al alloys (e.g., Cu and Mg) possess either very weak (Cu), or even repulsive (Mg), binding energies. Hence, we assert that some previously reported large binding energies for these solutes are erroneous. (ii) Large binding energies are found for Sn, Cd and In, confirming the proposed mechanism for the reduced natural aging in Al–Cu alloys containing microalloying additions of these solutes. (iii) In addition, we predict that similar reduction in natural aging should occur with additions of Si, Ge and Au. (iv) Even larger binding energies are found for other solutes (e.g., Pb, Bi, Sr, Ba), but these solutes possess essentially no solubility in Al.

  abstract = {Previous efforts to understand solute–vacancy binding in aluminum alloys have been hampered by a scarcity of reliable, quantitative experimental measurements. Here, we report a large database of solute–vacancy binding energies determined from first-principles density functional calculations. The calculated binding energies agree well with accurate measurements where available, and provide an accurate predictor of solute–vacancy binding in other systems. We find: (i) some common solutes in commercial Al alloys (e.g., Cu and Mg) possess either very weak (Cu), or even repulsive (Mg), binding energies. Hence, we assert that some previously reported large binding energies for these solutes are erroneous. (ii) Large binding energies are found for Sn, Cd and In, confirming the proposed mechanism for the reduced natural aging in Al–Cu alloys containing microalloying additions of these solutes. (iii) In addition, we predict that similar reduction in natural aging should occur with additions of Si, Ge and Au. (iv) Even larger binding energies are found for other solutes (e.g., Pb, Bi, Sr, Ba), but these solutes possess essentially no solubility in Al. (v) We have explored the physical effects controlling solute–vacancy binding in Al. We find that there is a strong correlation between binding energy and solute size, with larger solute atoms possessing a stronger binding with vacancies. (vi) Most transition-metal 3d solutes do not bind strongly with vacancies, and some are even energetically strongly repelled from vacancies, particularly for the early 3d solutes, Ti and V.},

  abstract = {The plastic deformation in hcp metals is complex, with the associated dislocation core structures and properties not well understood on many slip planes in most hcp metals. A first step in establishing the dislocation properties is to examine the stable stacking fault energy and its structure on relevant slip planes. However, this has been perplexing in the hcp structure due to additional in-plane displacements on both sides of the slip plane. Here, density functional theory guided by crystal symmetry analysis is used to study all relevant stable stacking faults in 6 hcp metals (Mg, Ti, Zr, Re, Zn, Cd). Specially, the stable stacking fault energy, position, and structure on the Basal, Prism I and II, Pyramidal I and II planes are determined using all-periodic supercells with full atomic relaxation. All metals show similar stacking fault position and structure as dictated by crystal symmetry, but the associated stacking fault energy, being governed by the atomic bonding, differs significantly among them. Stacking faults on all the slip planes except the Basal plane show substantial out-of-plane displacements while stacking faults on the Prism II, Pyramidal I and II planes show additional in-plane displacements, all extending to multiple atom layers. The in-plane displacements are not captured in the standard computational approach for stacking faults, and significant differences are shown in the energies of such stacking faults between the standard approach and fully-relaxed case. The existence of well-defined stable stacking fault on the Pyramidal planes suggests zonal dislocations are unlikely.

  abstract = {The plastic deformation in hcp metals is complex, with the associated dislocation core structures and properties not well understood on many slip planes in most hcp metals. A first step in establishing the dislocation properties is to examine the stable stacking fault energy and its structure on relevant slip planes. However, this has been perplexing in the hcp structure due to additional in-plane displacements on both sides of the slip plane. Here, density functional theory guided by crystal symmetry analysis is used to study all relevant stable stacking faults in 6 hcp metals (Mg, Ti, Zr, Re, Zn, Cd). Specially, the stable stacking fault energy, position, and structure on the Basal, Prism I and II, Pyramidal I and II planes are determined using all-periodic supercells with full atomic relaxation. All metals show similar stacking fault position and structure as dictated by crystal symmetry, but the associated stacking fault energy, being governed by the atomic bonding, differs significantly among them. Stacking faults on all the slip planes except the Basal plane show substantial out-of-plane displacements while stacking faults on the Prism II, Pyramidal I and II planes show additional in-plane displacements, all extending to multiple atom layers. The in-plane displacements are not captured in the standard computational approach for stacking faults, and significant differences are shown in the energies of such stacking faults between the standard approach and fully-relaxed case. The existence of well-defined stable stacking fault on the Pyramidal planes suggests zonal dislocations are unlikely. Calculations on the equilibrium partial separation further suggests 〈c þ a〉 dissociation into three partials on the Pyramidal I plane is unlikely and 〈c〉 dissociation on Prism planes is unlikely to be stable against climb-dissociation onto the Basal planes in these metals.},

With a combination of the orientation relationships between austenite, ferrite and cementite, we identify a metastable intermediate structure (MIS), which can serve as a link between the three phases. Based on this framework, different mechanisms depending on the local conditions (C concentration, strain, magnetism) are revealed from ab initio nudged elastic band simulations, which allow us to construct a unified theory for the structural transformations among austenite, ferrite and cementite.},

  abstract = {It has been shown that concentrated solid solution alloys possess unusual electronic, magnetic, transport, mechanical and radiation-resistant properties that are directly related to underlying chemical complexity. Because every atom experiences a different local atomic environment, the formation and migration energies of vacancies and interstitials in these alloys exhibit a distribution, rather than a single value as in a pure metal or dilute alloy. Using ab\;initio calculations based on density functional theory and special quasirandom structure, we have characterized the distribution of defect formation energy and migration barrier in four Ni-based solid-solution alloys: Ni0.5Co0.5, Ni0.5Fe0.5, Ni0.8Fe0.2, and Ni0.8Cr0.2. As defect formation energies in finite-size models depend sensitively on the elemental chemical potential, we have developed a computationally efficient method for determining it which takes into account the global composition and the local short-range order. In addition we have compared the results of our ab initio calculations to those obtained from available embedded atom method (EAM) potentials. Our results indicate that the defect formation and migration energies are closely related to the specific atomic size in the structure, which further determines the elemental diffusion properties. Different EAM potentials yield different features of defect energetics in concentrated alloys, pointing to the need for additional potential development efforts in order to allow spatial and temporal scale-up of defect and simulations, beyond those accessible to ab initio methods.},

  abstract = {Plastic flow in body-centered cubic (bcc) alloys is governed by the thermally-activated motion of screw dislocations in close-packed planes. In bcc interstitial solid solutions, solute diffusion can occur at very fast rates owing to low migration energies and solute concentrations. Under mechanical loading, solutes may move on the same or similar time scale as dislocations glide, even at low temperatures, potentially resulting in very rich co-evolution processes that may have important effects in the overall material response. It is therefore important to accurately quantify the coupling between interstitial impurities and dislocations, so that larger-scale models can correctly account for their interactions. In this paper, we use electronic structure calculations to obtain the energetics of oxygen diffusion under stress and its interaction energy with screw dislocation cores in bcc tungsten. We find that oxygen atoms preferentially migrate from tetrahedral to tetrahedral site with an energy of 0.2 eV. This energy couples only weakly to hydrostatic and deviatoric deformations, with activation volumes of less than 0.02 and 0.2b3, respectively. The strongest effect is found for the inelastic interaction between O atoms and screw dislocation cores, which leads to attractive energies between 1.2 and 1.9 eV and sometimes triggers a transformation of the screw dislocation core from an easy core configuration to a hard core configuration.},
