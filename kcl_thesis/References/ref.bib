                        free 37.9%) by standard crystallographic methods, after placing the densities corresponding to a single molecule into an artificial unit cell. The agreement between experimental and calculated phases along the helical layer-lines was used to monitor progress in the refinement and to give an independent measure of the accuracy. The atomic model allowed a detailed description of the whole receptor in the closed-channel form, including the ligand-binding and intracellular domains, which have not previously been interpreted at a chemical level. We confirm that the two ligand-binding ?? subunits have a different extended conformation from the three other subunits in the closed channel, and identify several interactions on both pairs of subunit interfaces, and within the ?? subunits, which may be responsible for their "distorted" structures. The ACh-coordinating amino acid side-chains of the ?? subunits are far apart in the closed channel, indicating that a localised rearrangement, involving closure of loops B and C around the bound ACh molecule, occurs upon activation. A comparison of the structure of the ?? subunit with that of AChBP having ligand present, suggests how the localised rearrangement overcomes the distortions and initiates the rotational movements associated with opening of the channel. Both vestibules of the channel are strongly electronegative, providing a cation-stabilising environment at either entrance of the membrane pore. Access to the pore on the intracellular side is further influenced by narrow lateral windows, which would be expected to screen out electrostatically ions of the wrong charge and size. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

RESULTS: In total, 12 FhuA Delta1-160 variants were generated to gain insights on sterically controlled compound fluxes: Subset A) six FhuA Delta1-160 variants in which one of the six lysines in the interior of FhuA Delta1-160 was substituted to alanine and Subset B) six FhuA Delta1-160 variants in which only one lysine inside the barrel was not changed to alanine. Translocation efficiencies were quantified with the colorimetric TMB (3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine) detection system employing horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Investigation of the six subset A variants identified position K556A as sterically important. The K556A substitution increases TMB diffusion from 15 to 97 [nM]/s and reaches nearly the TMB diffusion value of the unlabeled FhuA Delta1-160 (102 [nM]/s). The prominent role of position K556 is confirmed by the corresponding subset B variant which contains only the K556 lysine in the interior of the barrel. Pyridyl labeling of K556 reduces TMB translocation to 16 [nM]/s reaching nearly background levels in liposomes (13 [nM]/s). A first B-factor analysis based on MD simulations confirmed that position K556 is the least fluctuating lysine among the six in the channel interior of FhuA Delta1-160 and therefore well suited for controlling compound fluxes through steric hindrance.

CONCLUSIONS: A FhuA Delta1-160 based reduction triggered release system has been shown to control the compound flux by the presence of only one inner channel sterical hindrance based on 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionic-acid labeling (amino acid position K556). As a consequence, the release kinetic can be modulated by introducing an opportune number of hindrances. The FhuA Delta1-160 channel embedded in liposomes can be advanced to a universal and compound independent release system which allows a size selective compound release through rationally re-engineered channels.},

@article{Marks2011a,
        In this paper we ask whether we can infer evolutionary constraints from a set of sequence homologs of a protein. The challenge is to distinguish true co-evolution couplings from the noisy set of observed correlations. We address this challenge using a maximum entropy model of the protein sequence, constrained by the statistics of the multiple sequence alignment, to infer residue pair couplings. Surprisingly, we find that the strength of these inferred couplings is an excellent predictor of residue-residue proximity in folded structures. Indeed, the top-scoring residue couplings are sufficiently accurate and well-distributed to define the 3D protein fold with remarkable accuracy.
        We quantify this observation by computing, from sequence alone, all-atom 3D structures of fifteen test proteins from different fold classes, ranging in size from 50 to 260 residues., including a G-protein coupled receptor. These blinded inferences are de novo, i.e., they do not use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The co-evolution signals provide sufficient information to determine accurate 3D protein structure to 2.7–4.8 \AA C$\alpha$-RMSD error relative to the observed structure, over at least two-thirds of the protein (method called EVfold, details at http://EVfold.org). This discovery provides insight into essential interactions constraining protein evolution and will facilitate a comprehensive survey of the universe of protein structures, new strategies in protein and drug design, and the identification of functional genetic variants in normal and disease genomes.},

Insight into a retinal degeneration disease
Human bestrophin 1 (hBest1) is a membrane protein that forms a chloride channel in the retinal pigment epithelium. Mutations in hBest1 can lead to a retinal degeneration disease known as Best disease. Yang et al. describe the structure of KpBest, a bacterial homolog of hBest1. KpBest forms a pentamer with an ion channel at its center. In contrast to hBest1, KpBest1 is a sodium channel. The structure suggests a mechanism for ion selectivity that was confirmed by mutagenesis of KpBest and hBest1. A model of the hBest1 channel structure based on the KpBest structure reveals how mutations cause disease.

RESULTS: We computed the GNM dynamics for 20 058 structures from the Protein Data Bank, and generated information on the equilibrium dynamics at the level of individual residues. The results are stored on a web-based system called iGNM and configured so as to permit the users to visualize or download the results through a standard web browser using a simple search engine. Static and animated images for describing the conformational mobility of proteins over a broad range of normal modes are accessible, along with an online calculation engine available for newly deposited structures. A case study of the dynamics of 20 non-homologous hydrolases is presented to illustrate the utility of the iGNM database for identifying key residues that control the cooperative motions and revealing the connection between collective dynamics and catalytic activity.},

@article{Neale2011,
In recent years, atomistic molecular simulations have become a method of choice for studying the interaction of small molecules, peptides, and proteins with biological membranes. Here, we critically examine the statistical convergence of equilibrium properties in molecular simulations of two amino acid side-chain analogs, leucine and arginine, in the presence of a hydrated phospholipid bilayer. To this end, the convergence of the standard binding free energy for the reversible insertion of the solutes in the bilayer is systematically assessed by evaluating dozens of separate sets of umbrella sampling calculations for a total simulation time exceeding 400 ?s. We identify rare and abrupt transitions in bilayer structure as a function of solute insertion depth. These transitions correspond to the slow reorganization of ionic interactions involving zwitterionic phospholipid headgroups when the solutes penetrate the lipid?water interface and when arginine is forced through the bilayer center. These rare events are shown to constitute hidden sampling barriers that limit the rate of convergence of equilibrium properties and result in systematic sampling errors. Our analysis demonstrates that the difficulty of attaining convergence for lipid bilayer-embedded solutes has, in general, been drastically underestimated. This information will assist future studies in improving accuracy by selecting a more appropriate reaction coordinate or by focusing computational resources on those regions of the reaction coordinate that exhibit slow convergence of equilibrium properties.},

          Penetratin is a positively charged cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) that has the ability to bind negatively charged membrane components, such as glycosaminoglycans and anionic lipids. Whether this primary interaction of penetratin with these cell surface components implies that the peptide will be further internalized is not clear.
        
        
          Methodology
          Using mass spectrometry, the amount of internalized and membrane bound penetratin remaining after washings, were quantified in three different cell lines: wild type (WT), glycosaminoglycans- (GAGneg) and sialic acid-deficient (SAneg) cells. Additionally, the affinity and kinetics of the interaction of penetratin to membrane models composed of pure lipids and membrane fragments from the referred cell lines was investigated, as well as the thermodynamics of such interactions using plasmon resonance and calorimetry.
        
        
          Principal Findings
          Penetratin internalized with the same efficacy in the three cell lines at 1 µM, but was better internalized at 10 µM in SAneg>WT>GAGneg. The heat released by the interaction of penetratin with these cells followed the ranking order of internalization efficiency. Penetratin had an affinity of 10 nM for WT cells and µM for SAneg and GAGneg cells and model membrane of phospholipids. The remaining membrane-bound penetratin after cells washings was similar in WT and GAGneg cells, which suggested that these binding sites relied on membrane phospholipids. The interaction of penetratin with carbohydrates was more superficial and reversible while it was stronger with phospholipids, likely because the peptide can intercalate between the fatty acid chains.
        
        
          Conclusion/Significance
          These results show that accumulation and high-affinity binding of penetratin at the cell-surface do not reflect the internalization efficacy of the peptide. Altogether, these data further support translocation (membrane phospholipids interaction) as being the internalization pathway used by penetratin at low micromolecular concentration, while endocytosis is activated at higher concentration and requires accumulation of the peptide on GAG and GAG clustering.},

          The last two decades have witnessed a dramatic acceleration in the production of genomic sequence information and publication of biomedical articles. Despite the fact that genome sequence data and publications are two of the most heavily relied-upon sources of information for many biologists, very little effort has been made to systematically integrate data from genomic sequences directly with the biological literature. For a limited number of model organisms dedicated teams manually curate publications about genes; however for species with no such dedicated staff many thousands of articles are never mapped to genes or genomic regions.
        
        
          Methodology/Principal Findings
          To overcome the lack of integration between genomic data and biological literature, we have developed pubmed2ensembl (http://www.pubmed2ensembl.org), an extension to the BioMart system that links over 2,000,000 articles in PubMed to nearly 150,000 genes in Ensembl from 50 species. We use several sources of curated (e.g., Entrez Gene) and automatically generated (e.g., gene names extracted through text-mining on MEDLINE records) sources of gene-publication links, allowing users to filter and combine different data sources to suit their individual needs for information extraction and biological discovery. In addition to extending the Ensembl BioMart database to include published information on genes, we also implemented a scripting language for automated BioMart construction and a novel BioMart interface that allows text-based queries to be performed against PubMed and PubMed Central documents in conjunction with constraints on genomic features. Finally, we illustrate the potential of pubmed2ensembl through typical use cases that involve integrated queries across the biomedical literature and genomic data.
        
        
          Conclusion/Significance
          By allowing biologists to find the relevant literature on specific genomic regions or sets of functionally related genes more easily, pubmed2ensembl offers a much-needed genome informatics inspired solution to accessing the ever-increasing biomedical literature.},

          Rab GTPases constitute the largest subfamily of the Ras protein superfamily. Rab proteins regulate organelle biogenesis and transport, and display distinct binding preferences for effector and activator proteins, many of which have not been elucidated yet. The underlying molecular recognition motifs, binding partner preferences and selectivities are not well understood.
        
        
          Methodology/Principal Findings
          Comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences and the three-dimensional electrostatic and hydrophobic molecular interaction fields of 62 human Rab proteins revealed a wide range of binding properties with large differences between some Rab proteins. This analysis assists the functional annotation of Rab proteins 12, 14, 26, 37 and 41 and provided an explanation for the shared function of Rab3 and 27. Rab7a and 7b have very different electrostatic potentials, indicating that they may bind to different effector proteins and thus, exert different functions. The subfamily V Rab GTPases which are associated with endosome differ subtly in the interaction properties of their switch regions, and this may explain exchange factor specificity and exchange kinetics.
        
        
          Conclusions/Significance
          We have analysed conservation of sequence and of molecular interaction fields to cluster and annotate the human Rab proteins. The analysis of three dimensional molecular interaction fields provides detailed insight that is not available from a sequence-based approach alone. Based on our results, we predict novel functions for some Rab proteins and provide insights into their divergent functions and the determinants of their binding partner selectivity.},

Monosaccharide derivatives such as xylose, fucose, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), N-acetylgalactosamine (GlaNAc), glucuronic acid, iduronic acid, and N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) are important components of eukaryotic glycans. The present work details the development of force-field parameters for these monosaccharides and their covalent connections to proteins via O linkages to serine or threonine side chains and via N linkages to asparagine side chains. The force field development protocol was designed to explicitly yield parameters that are compatible with the existing CHARMM additive force field for proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, and small molecules. Therefore, when combined with previously developed parameters for pyranose and furanose monosaccharides, for glycosidic linkages between monosaccharides, and for proteins, the present set of parameters enables the molecular simulation of a wide variety of biologically important molecules such as complex carbohydrates and glycoproteins. Parametrization included fitting to quantum mechanical (QM) geometries and conformational energies of model compounds, as well as to QM pair interaction energies and distances of model compounds with water. Parameters were validated in the context of crystals of relevant monosaccharides, as well NMR and/or X-ray crystallographic data on larger systems including oligomeric hyaluronan, sialyl Lewis X, O- and N-linked glycopeptides, and a lectin:sucrose complex. As the validated parameters are an extension of the CHARMM all-atom additive biomolecular force field, they further broaden the types of heterogeneous systems accessible with a consistently developed force-field model.},

@article{Levine2011,
The computational design of advanced materials based on surfactant self-assembly without ever stepping foot in the laboratory is an important goal, but there are significant barriers to this approach due to the limited spatial and temporal scales accessible by computer simulations. In this paper, we report our work to bridge the gap between laboratory and computational timescales by implementing the coarse-grained (CG) force field of Shinoda, DeVane, and Klein into the HOOMD-Blue GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics software package. For a system of 25,750 particles, this implementation provides performance on a single GPU which is superior to that of a widely-used parallel MD simulation code running on an optimally-sized CPU-based cluster. Using our GPU setup, we have collected 0.6 milliseconds of molecular dynamics trajectory data for aqueous solutions of 7 different non-ionic polyethylene glycol (PEG) surfactants, with most of the systems studied representing approximately 1,000,000 atoms. From this data, we calculated various properties as a function of the length of the hydrophobic tails and PEG head groups. Specifically, we determined critical micelle concentrations (CMC) which are in good agreement with experimental data and characterized the size and shape of micelles. However, even with the microsecond trajectories employed in this study, we observed that the micelles composed of relatively hydrophobic surfactants are continuing to grow at the end of our simulations. This suggests that the final micelle size distributions of these systems depend strongly on initial conditions and that either longer simulations or advanced sampling techniques are needed to properly sample their equilibrium distributions. Nonetheless, the combination of coarse-grained modeling and GPU acceleration marks a significant step towards the computational prediction of the thermodynamic properties of slowly-evolving surfactant systems.},

@article{Braun2012,
Using a combination of X-ray scattering, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and potential of mean force calculations, we have explored the membrane remodeling effects of monomeric $\alpha$-synuclein ($\alpha$S). Our initial findings from multiple approaches are that $\alpha$S (1) causes a significant thinning of the bilayer and (2) stabilizes positive mean curvature, such that the maximum principle curvature matches that of synaptic vesicles, $\alpha$S-induced tubules, and the synthetic lipid vesicles to which the protein binds most tightly. This suggests that $\alpha$S binding to synaptic vesicles likely stabilizes their intrinsic curvature. We then show that $\alpha$S induces local negative Gaussian curvature, an effect that occurs in regions of $\alpha$S shown previously via NMR and corroborated by MD simulation to have significant conformational flexibility. The induction of negative Gaussian curvature, which has implications for all curvature-sensing and curvature-generating amphipathic $\alpha$-helices, supports a hypothesis that connects helix insertion to fusion and fission of vesicles, processes that have recently been linked to $\alpha$S function. Then, in an effort to explain these biophysical properties of $\alpha$S, we promote an intrinsic curvature-field model that recasts long-range protein?protein interactions in terms of the interactions between the local curvature fields generated by lipid?protein complexes.},

The MARTINI coarse-grained force field [Monticelli, L. et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput.2008, 4, 819?834] is examined for use in molecular dynamics simulations of the dissociation of gas-phase protein complexes. Coarse-grained force fields allow longer time scales and larger systems to be treated compared with all-atom force fields. In this work, results for the dissociation of the cytochrome c? dimer using MARTINI are compared with published studies using the OPLS-AA/L all-atom force field. Several structural parameters such as the minimum distance between monomers, radius of gyration, and root-mean-square deviation as well as potential energy contributions (Lennard-Jones and Coulomb) are calculated as a function of the center of mass distance. The MARTINI force field semiquantitatively reproduces the results of previous all-atom studies but appears to be somewhat too attractive.},

@article{VanDijk2012,
Molecular dynamics simulations are becoming a standard part of workflows in structural biology. They are used for tasks as diverse as assessing molecular flexibility, probing conformational changes, assessing the impact of mutations, or gaining information about molecular interactions. However, performing a successful simulation requires sufficient computational resources, familiarity with the simulation software, and experience in the setup of a system and the analysis of the resulting trajectories. These considerations become especially critical in large-scale parametric MD simulations. Offering such tools to a wide user community requires a robust and versatile, but user-friendly, facility for molecular dynamics simulations with access to vast computational resources. Here, we present the GROMACS grid-enabled Web portal for the setup and execution of molecular dynamics simulation on the WeNMR grid infrastructure, a distributed network of computational resources within the European Grid Initiative. The Web portal aims at ease-of-use through automated setup of the simulation system using best-practice protocols, yet allowing for tuning of key parameters. Alternatively, the simulation can be started from preconfigured GROMACS simulation systems. Performing multiple lengthy calculations using multiple processors on the WeNMR grid infrastructure ensures scalability. The combination of analysis routines for quality assurance and automatic recovery in case of failures provides a reliable platform for MD simulations. The GROMACS Web portal is embedded within the services of the WeNMR Virtual Research Community (VRC) accessible from http://www.wenmr.eu/wenmr/nmr-services . It is freely accessible upon registration with a valid X509 personal certificate with the enmr.eu Virtual Organization (VO).},

Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of druglike molecules embedded in lipid bilayers are of considerable interest as models for drug penetration and positioning in biological membranes. Here we analyze partitioning of coumarin in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayer, based on both multiple, unbiased 3 ?s MD simulations (total length) and free energy profiles along the bilayer normal calculated by biased MD simulations (?7 ?s in total). The convergences in time of free energy profiles calculated by both umbrella sampling and z-constraint techniques are thoroughly analyzed. Two sets of starting structures are also considered, one from unbiased MD simulation and the other from ?pulling? coumarin along the bilayer normal. The structures obtained by pulling simulation contain water defects on the lipid bilayer surface, while those acquired from unbiased simulation have no membrane defects. The free energy profiles converge more rapidly when starting frames from unbiased simulations are used. In addition, z-constraint simulation leads to more rapid convergence than umbrella sampling, due to quicker relaxation of membrane defects. Furthermore, we show that the choice of RESP, PRODRG, or Mulliken charges considerably affects the resulting free energy profile of our model drug along the bilayer normal. We recommend using z-constraint biased MD simulations based on starting geometries acquired from unbiased MD simulations for efficient calculation of convergent free energy profiles of druglike molecules along bilayer normals. The calculation of free energy profile should start with an unbiased simulation, though the polar molecules might need a slow pulling afterward. Results obtained with the recommended simulation protocol agree well with available experimental data for two coumarin derivatives.},

        In this paper we ask whether we can infer evolutionary constraints from a set of sequence homologs of a protein. The challenge is to distinguish true co-evolution couplings from the noisy set of observed correlations. We address this challenge using a maximum entropy model of the protein sequence, constrained by the statistics of the multiple sequence alignment, to infer residue pair couplings. Surprisingly, we find that the strength of these inferred couplings is an excellent predictor of residue-residue proximity in folded structures. Indeed, the top-scoring residue couplings are sufficiently accurate and well-distributed to define the 3D protein fold with remarkable accuracy.
        We quantify this observation by computing, from sequence alone, all-atom 3D structures of fifteen test proteins from different fold classes, ranging in size from 50 to 260 residues., including a G-protein coupled receptor. These blinded inferences are de novo, i.e., they do not use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The co-evolution signals provide sufficient information to determine accurate 3D protein structure to 2.7–4.8 \AA C$\alpha$-RMSD error relative to the observed structure, over at least two-thirds of the protein (method called EVfold, details at http://EVfold.org). This discovery provides insight into essential interactions constraining protein evolution and will facilitate a comprehensive survey of the universe of protein structures, new strategies in protein and drug design, and the identification of functional genetic variants in normal and disease genomes.},

Characterizing the structure?function relationships of glycolipids in lipid membranes is a challenging endeavor. Glycolipid ?structure? is rarely, if ever, a unique low-energy conformer, but an ensemble of dynamic states, which vary in their presentation of binding epitopes. The modulation of binding epitopes not only is an internal process but also is influenced by external factors such as glycolipid clustering and fluctuations in and composition of the fluid membrane environment. As with other glyco-conjugates, three-dimensional structural elucidation has relied heavily on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and computational modeling. Discrete conformational states can be discerned from motion-averaged experimental data by employing independent molecular dynamics simulations. Using model membranes such as micelles, bicelles, and bilayers, we can approximate the effect of their biological environment and quantify cell-surface presentation.},

@article{Luan2012,
A carbon nanotube (CNT) can be toxic to a living cell by binding to proteins and then impairing their functionalities; however, an efficient screening method that examines the binding capability of a CNT to protein molecules in vitro is still unavailable. Here, we show that a nanopore-based sensor can be used to investigate CNT?protein interactions. With proof-of-principle molecular dynamics simulations, we have measured ionic currents in a nanopore when threading a CNT?protein complex through the pore and demonstrated that the CNT?s binding capability, and thus potential nanotoxicity, can be inferred from electric signals. We have then further investigated mechanics and energetics of CNT?protein interactions with the nanopore sensor. These findings indicate that solid-state nanopores have the potential to be ultrasensitive and high-throughput sensors for nanotoxicity.},
