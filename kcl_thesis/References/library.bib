abstract = {The calculation of free-energy landscapes in proteins is a challenge for modern numerical simulations. As to the case of potassium ion channels is concerned, it is particularly interesting because of the nanometric dimensions of the selectivity filter, where the complex electrostatics is highly relevant. The present study aims at comparing three different techniques used to bias molecular dynamics simulations, namely Umbrella Sampling, Steered Molecular Dynamics, and Metadynamics, never applied all together in the past to the same channel protein. Our test case is represented by potassium ions permeating the selectivity filter of the KcsA channel.},

abstract = {Membrane electroporation is the method to directly transfer bioactive substances such as drugs and genes into living cells, as well as preceding electrofusion. Although much information on the microscopic mechanism has been obtained both from experiment and simulation, the existence and nature of possible intermediates is still unclear. To elucidate intermediates of electropore formation by direct comparison with measured prepore formation kinetics, we have carried out 49 atomistic electroporation simulations on a palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine bilayer for electric field strengths between 0.04 and 0.7 V/nm. A statistical theory is developed to facilitate direct comparison of experimental (macroscopic) prepore formation kinetics with the (single event) preporation times derived from the simulations, which also allows us to extract an effective number of lipids involved in each pore formation event. A linear dependency of the activation energy for prepore formation on the applied field is seen, with quantitative agreement between experiment and simulation. The distribution of preporation times suggests a four-state pore formation model. The model involves a first intermediate characterized by a differential tilt of the polar lipid headgroups on both leaflets, and a second intermediate (prepore), where a polar chain across the bilayer is formed by 3-4 lipid headgroups and several water molecules, thereby providing a microscopic explanation for the polarizable volume derived previously from the measured kinetics. An average pore radius of 0.47 +/- 0.15 nm is seen, in favorable agreement with conductance measurements and electrooptical experiments of lipid vesicles.},

abstract = {Biological polymers hybridized with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have elicited much interest recently for applications in SWCNT-based sorting as well as biomedical imaging, sensing, and drug delivery. Recently, de novo designed peptides forming a coiled-coil structure have been engineered to selectively disperse SWCNT of a certain diameter. Here we report on a study of the binding strength and structural stability of the hybrid between such a "HexCoil-Ala" peptide and the (6,5)-SWCNT. Using the competitive binding of a surfactant, we find that affinity strength of the peptide ranks in comparison to that of two single-stranded DNA sequences as (GT)30-DNA > HexCoil-Ala > (TAT)4T-DNA. Further, using replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), we show that the hexamer peptide complex has both similarities with and differences from the original design. While one of two distinct helix-helix interfaces of the original model was largely retained, a second interface showed much greater variability. These conformational differences allowed an aromatic tyrosine residue designed to lie along the solvent-exposed surface of the protein instead to penetrate between the two helices and directly contact the SWCNT. These insights will inform future designs of SWCNT-interacting peptides.},

Recent progress has been made with nanopore fabrication and sophistication, as well as with applications in DNA/protein mapping, biomolecular structure analysis, protein detection, and DNA sequencing. In addition, concepts for DNA sequencing devices have been suggested, and computational efforts have been made. The state of the nanopore field is maturing and given the right type of nanopore and operating conditions, nearly every application could revolutionize medicine in terms of speed, cost, and quality.

abstract = {A study of the voltage induction of transient pores in phospholipid bilayer vesicles is reported. Unilamellar vesicles (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine), with a size distribution of 100 +/- 30 nm, were prepared by the method of Enoch & Strittmatter [Enoch, H., & Strittmatter, P. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 76, 145]. The vesicles loaded with [14C]sucrose and suspended in a mixture of 150 mM NaCl and 272 mM sucrose (both are the isotonic solvent for erythrocytes) were exposed to an intense electric field in the range of 20--40 kV/cm, with a field decay time of 5--15 micro second. A transient leakage of sucrose label was detected when the field strength exceeded 30 kV/cm. After the field was removed, no slow leakage of the tracer molecules occurred during a 65-h incubation period at the room temperature (23 +/- 2 degrees C). The leakage is attributed to the field-induced transmembrane potential, but not other effects such as the Joule heating or the shock wave associated with the voltage discharge. When the potential exceeded a threshold value of 200 mV, corresponding to an applied field strength of 30 kV/cm, there was a dielectric breakdown of the bilayer structure. Pores which allowed passage of sucrose were formed, transiently. Experiments show that these pores were fully reversible, and no global and permanent damages to the vesicle bilayer were detected. The implication of this membrane potential triggered conducting state of lipid bilayers to biological functions of cells is discussed.},

Because existing detoxification platforms such as antisera, monoclonal antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors and molecularly imprinted polymers act by targeting the molecular structures of toxins, customized treatments are required for different diseases. Here, we show a biomimetic toxin nanosponge that functions as a toxin decoy in vivo. The nanosponge, which consists of a polymeric nanoparticle core surrounded by red blood cell membranes, absorbs membrane-damaging toxins and diverts them away from their cellular targets. In a mouse model, the nanosponges markedly reduce the toxicity of staphylococcal alpha-haemolysin ($\alpha$-toxin) and thus improve the survival rate of toxin-challenged mice. This biologically inspired toxin nanosponge presents a detoxification treatment that can potentially treat a variety of injuries and diseases caused by pore-forming toxins.},

abstract = {Cyclodextrins (CDs) have been widely used in host-guest molecular recognition because of their chiral and hydrophobic cavities. For example, $\beta$-cyclodextrin ($\beta$CD) lodged as a molecular adaptor in protein pores such as $\alpha$-hemolysin ($\alpha$HL) is used for stochastic sensing. Here, we have tuned the cavity and overall size of $\beta$CD by replacing a single oxygen atom in its ring skeleton by a disulfide unit in two different configurations to both expand our ability to detect analytes and understand the interactions of $\beta$CD with protein pores. The three-dimensional structures of the two stereoisomeric CDs have been determined by the combined application of NMR spectroscopy and molecular simulation and show distorted conformations as compared to natural $\beta$CD. The interactions of these synthetic $\beta$CD analogues with mutant $\alpha$HL protein pores and guest molecules were studied by single-channel electrical recording. The dissociation rate constants for both disulfide CDs from the mutant pores show ∼1000-fold increase as compared to those of unaltered $\beta$CD, but are ∼10-fold lower than the dissociation rate constants for $\beta$CD from wild-type $\alpha$HL. Both of the skeleton-modified CDs show altered selectivity toward guest molecules. Our approach expands the breadth in sensitivity and diversity of sensing with protein pores and suggests structural parameters useful for CD design, particularly in the creation of asymmetric cavities.},

The fine regulation of the ion transport through these wide channels could play an important role in the survival of the bacteria in acidic media. We investigate here the mechanism responsible for the pH sensitivity of the trimeric porin OmpF, of Escherichia coli. Planar lipid bilayer electrophysiology and site-directed mutagenesis were used to study the effect of pH on the ion conductive properties of the OmpF channel in its fully open, "nongated" conformation. At low pH we observe a large drop in the OmpF open channel conductance that is accompanied by a substantial increase of the current noise. These channel features are strongly dependent on the salt concentration and we propose that they are originated by competitive binding of cations and protons occurring in the narrow central constriction of the channel. This subtle mechanism reveals to be capital for the channel function because it not only drives the channel sensitivity to pH but is also indispensable for the particularly efficient permeation mechanism of the channel at physiological conditions ($\sim$ neutral pH). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We have used multiscale molecular dynamics simulations to determine the extent to which interactions with lipids are conserved across the aquaporin (Aqp) family of membrane proteins. Simulation-based assessment of the lipid interactions made by Aqps when embedded within a simple phospholipid bilayer agrees well with the protein-lipid contacts determined by electron diffraction from 2D crystals. Extending this simulation-based analysis to all Aqps of known structure reveals a degree of conservation of such interactions across the Aqp structural proteome. Despite similarities in the binding orientations and interactions of the lipids, there do not appear to be distinct, high-specificity lipid binding sites on the surface of Aqps. Rather Aqps exhibit a more broadly conserved protein/lipid interface, suggestive of interchange between annular and bulk lipids, instead of a fixed annular "shell" of lipids.},

The agreement between experimental and calculated phases along the helical layer-lines was used to monitor progress in the refinement and to give an independent measure of the accuracy. The atomic model allowed a detailed description of the whole receptor in the closed-channel form, including the ligand-binding and intracellular domains, which have not previously been interpreted at a chemical level. We confirm that the two ligand-binding ?? subunits have a different extended conformation from the three other subunits in the closed channel, and identify several interactions on both pairs of subunit interfaces, and within the ?? subunits, which may be responsible for their "distorted" structures. The ACh-coordinating amino acid side-chains of the ?? subunits are far apart in the closed channel, indicating that a localised rearrangement, involving closure of loops B and C around the bound ACh molecule, occurs upon activation. A comparison of the structure of the ?? subunit with that of AChBP having ligand present, suggests how the localised rearrangement overcomes the distortions and initiates the rotational movements associated with opening of the channel. Both vestibules of the channel are strongly electronegative, providing a cation-stabilising environment at either entrance of the membrane pore. Access to the pore on the intracellular side is further influenced by narrow lateral windows, which would be expected to screen out electrostatically ions of the wrong charge and size. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The dynamic electrowetting and dewetting of ionic liquids are investigated with high-speed video microscopy. Five imidazolium-based ionic liquids ([BMIM]BF(4), [BMIM]PF(6), [BMIM]NTf(2), [HMIM]NTf(2), and [OMIM]BF(4)) are used as probe liquids. Droplets of ionic liquids are first spread on an insulated electrode by applying an external voltage (electrowetting) and then allowed to retract (dewetting) when the voltage is switched off. The base area of the droplet varies exponentially during both the electrowetting and retraction processes. The characteristic time increases with the viscosity of the ionic liquid. The electrowetting and retraction kinetics (dynamic contact angle vs contact line speed) can be described by the hydrodynamic or the molecular-kinetic model. Energy dissipation occurs by viscous and molecular routes with a larger proportion of energy dissipated at the three-phase contact line when the liquid meniscus retracts from the solid surface. The outcomes from this research have implications for the design and control of electro-optical imaging systems, microfluidics, and fuel cells.},

abstract = {$\Delta$98$\Delta$ is a functional all-$\beta$ sheet variant of intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) that was generated by controlled proteolysis. This framework is useful to study the molecular determinants related to aggregation of $\beta$-barrel proteins. Albeit displaying increased conformational plasticity, $\Delta$98$\Delta$ exhibits a nativelike $\beta$-barrel topology and is able to support a cooperative folding behavior. Here we present a comparative study of IFABP and $\Delta$98$\Delta$ regarding their conformational perturbation and aggregation propensity triggered by trifluoroethanol. Both proteins share a common nucleation-elongation mechanism, whereby the rate-limiting step is the formation of stable dimeric nuclei followed by the association of monomers to the growing aggregates. Despite leading to a less stable structure, the extensive truncation of IFABP yields a form exhibiting a somewhat lower tendency to aggregate. This finding appears at odds with the established notion that a perturbation of the native compact fold should necessarily favor the population of aggregation-prone species. In addition to the aggregation propensity dictated by a given amino-acid sequence, our contention holds that long-range interactions might also play a major role in determining the overall aggregation propensity.},

abstract = {1. A comparative study of the whole-cell and single-channel properties of cloned and native mouse 5-hydroxytryptamine ionotropic receptors (5-HT3) was undertaken using mammalian cell lines expressing the cloned 5-HT3 receptor subunit A (5-HT3R-A), superior cervical ganglia (SCG) neurones and N1E-115 cells. 2. No pharmacological difference was found in the sensitivity to the agonists 5-HT and 2-methyl-5-HT, or to the antagonists d-tubocurare and 3-tropanyl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate (MDL-72222). 3. Current-voltage (I-V) relationships of whole-cell currents showed inward rectification in the three preparations. Rectification was stronger both in cells expressing the 5-HT3R-A subunit and in N1E-115 cells when compared with SCG neurones. 4. No clear openings could be resolved in 5-HT-activated currents in patches excised from cells expressing the 5-HT3R-A subunit or N1E-115 cells. Current fluctuation analysis of whole-cell and excised-patch records revealed a slope conductance of 0.4-0.6 pS in both preparations. Current-voltage relationships of these channels showed strong rectification that fully accounted for the whole-cell voltage dependence. 5. In contrast, single channels of about 10 pS were activated by 5-HT in patches excised from SCG neurones. The weak voltage dependence of their conductance did not account completely for the rectification of whole-cell currents. A lower unitary conductance (3.4 pS) was inferred from whole-cell noise analysis. 6. We conclude that the receptor expressed from the cloned cDNA is indistinguishable from the 5-HT3 receptor of N1E-115 cells, suggesting an identical structure for these two receptors. The higher conductance and different voltage dependence of the 5-HT3 receptor in SCG neurones might indicate the participation of an additional subunit in the structure of native ganglionic 5-HT3 receptors. Homo-oligomeric 5-HT3R-A channels may also be present as suggested by the lower conductance estimated by whole-cell noise analysis.},

abstract = {Nanopores have emerged as promising next-generation devices for DNA sequencing technology. The two major challenges in such devices are: (i) find an efficient way to raise the DNA capture rate prior to funnelling a nanopore, and (ii) reduce the translocation velocity inside it so that single base resolution can be attained efficiently. To achieve these, a novel soft nanopore comprising a solid-state nanopore and a functionalized soft layer is proposed to regulate the DNA electrokinetic translocation. We show that, in addition to the presence of an electroosmotic flow (EOF), which reduces the DNA translocation velocity, counterion concentration polarization (CP) occurs near the entrance of the nanopore. The latter establishes an enrichment of the counterion concentration field, thereby electrostatically enhancing the capture rate. The dependence of the ionic current on the bulk salt concentration, the soft layer properties, and the length of the nanopore are investigated. We show that if the salt concentration is low, the ionic current depends largely upon the length of the nanopore, and the density of the fixed charge of the soft layer, but not upon its degree of softness. On the other hand, if it is high, ionic current blockade always occurs, regardless of the levels of the other parameters. The proposed soft nanopore is capable of enhancing the performance of DNA translocation while maintaining its basic signature of the ionic current at high salt concentration. The results gathered provide the necessary information for designing devices used in DNA sequencing.},

A dynamic modeling approach based on swarm intelligence was applied, whereby the intrinsic flexibility of aerolysin extracted from new X-ray structures was used to fully exploit the cryo-EM spatial restraints. Using this integrated strategy, we obtained a radically new arrangement of the prepore conformation and a near-atomistic structure of the aerolysin pore, which is fully consistent with all of the biochemical data available so far. Upon transition from the prepore to pore, the aerolysin heptamer shows a unique concerted swirling movement, accompanied by a vertical collapse of the complex, ultimately leading to the insertion of a transmembrane $\beta$-barrel.},

abstract = {Learning from nature has inspired the creation of intelligent devices to meet the increasing needs of the advanced community and also to better understand how to imitate biology. As one of biomimetic nanodevices, nanochannels or nanopores aroused particular interest because of their potential applications in nanofluidic devices, biosensing, filtration, and energy conversions. In this review we have summarized some recent results mainly focused on the design, construction and application in energy conversion systems. Like biological nanochannels, the prepared smart artificial nanochannels fabricated by ion track-etched polymer membranes and smart molecules show a great potential in the field of bioengineering and biotechnology. And these applications can not only help people to know and understand the living processes in nature, but can also inspire scientists to study and develop novel nanodevices with better performance for the mankind.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations were used for a comprehensive study of the structural properties of saturated lipid bilayers, DPPC and DPPE, near the main phase transition. Though the chemical structure of DPPC and DPPE are largely similar (they only differ in the choline and ethanolamine groups), their transformation process from a gel to a liquid-crystalline state is contrasting. For DPPC, three distinct structures can be identified relative to the melting temperature (Tm): below Tm with "mixed" domains consisting of lipids that are tilted with partial overlap of the lipid tails between leaflet; near Tm with a slight increase in the average area per lipid, resulting in a rearrangement of the lipid tails and an increase in the bilayer thickness; and above Tm with unhindered lipid tails in random motion resulting in an increase in %gauche formed and increase in the level of interdigitation between lipid leaflets. For DPPE, the structures identified were below Tm with "ordered" domains consisting of slightly tilted lipid tails and non-overlapping lipid tails between leaflets, near Tm with minimal rearrangement of the lipids as the bilayer thickness reduces slightly with increasing temperature, and above Tm with unhindered lipid tails as that for DPPC. For DPPE, most of the lipid tails do not overlap as observed to DPPC, which is due to the tight packing of the DPPE molecules. The non-overlapping behavior of DPPE above Tm is confirmed from the density profile of the terminal carbon atoms in each leaflet, which shows a narrow distribution near the center of the bilayer core. This study also demonstrates that atomistic simulations are capable of capturing the phase transition behavior of lipid bilayers, providing a rich set of molecular and structural information at and near the transition state. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The mechanism of ion channel voltage gating—how channels open and close in response to voltage changes—has been debated since Hodgkin and Huxley’s seminal discovery that the crux of nerve conduction is ion flow across cellular membranes. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we show how a voltage-gated potassium channel (KV) switches between activated and deactivated states. On deactivation, pore hydrophobic collapse rapidly halts ion flow. Subsequent voltage-sensing domain (VSD) relaxation, including inward, 15-angstrom S4-helix motion, completes the transition. On activation, outward S4 motion tightens the VSD–pore linker, perturbing linker–S6-helix packing. Fluctuations allow water, then potassium ions, to reenter the pore; linker-S6 repacking stabilizes the open pore. We propose a mechanistic model for the sodium/potassium/calcium voltage-gated ion channel superfamily that reconciles apparently conflicting experimental data.},

abstract = {Single nanopores attract a great deal of scientific interest as a basis for biosensors and as a system to study the interactions and behavior of molecules in a confined volume. Tuning the geometry and surface chemistry of nanopores helps create devices that control transport of ions and molecules in solution. Here, we present single conically shaped nanopores whose narrow opening of 8 or 12 nm is modified with single-stranded DNA molecules. We find that the DNA occludes the narrow opening of nanopores and that the blockade extent decreases with the ionic strength of the background electrolyte. The results are explained by the ionic strength dependence of the persistence length of DNA. At low KCl concentrations (10 mM) the molecules assume an extended and rigid conformation, thereby blocking the pore lumen and reducing the flow of ionic current to a greater extent than compacted DNA at high salt concentrations. Attaching flexible polymers to the pore walls hence creates a system with tunable opening diameters in order to regulate transport of both neutral and charged species.},

abstract = {Sialic acids are acidic sugars present mostly on vertebrate cell surfaces, which can be metabolized by bacteria and act as an inflammation signal. N-Acetylneuraminic acid, the most abundant sialic acid, can enter into Escherichia coli K12 through NanC, an N-acetylneuraminic acid-inducible outer-membrane channel. With its 215 residues, NanC belongs to the family of small monomeric KdgM-related porins. KdgM homologues are found in gammaproteobacteria, including major plant and human pathogens, and together they define a large family of putative acidic sugar/oligosaccharide transporters, which are as yet poorly characterized. Here, we present the first high-resolution structure of a KdgM family member. NanC folds into a 28-A-high, 12-stranded beta-barrel, resembling the beta-domain of autotransporter NalP and defining an open pore with an average radius of 3.3 A. The channel is lined by two strings of basic residues facing each other across the pore, a feature that appears largely conserved within the KdgM family and is likely to facilitate the diffusion of acidic oligosaccharides.},

Free diffusion of urea across cell membranes is slow owing to its high polarity, and specialized urea transporters have evolved to achieve rapid and selective urea permeation. Here we present the 2.3 A structure of a functional urea transporter from the bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris. The transporter is a homotrimer, and each subunit contains a continuous membrane-spanning pore formed by the two homologous halves of the protein. The pore contains a constricted selectivity filter that can accommodate several dehydrated urea molecules in single file. Backbone and side-chain oxygen atoms provide continuous coordination of urea as it progresses through the filter, and well-placed alpha-helix dipoles provide further compensation for dehydration energy. These results establish that the urea transporter operates by a channel-like mechanism and reveal the physical and chemical basis of urea selectivity.},

abstract = {The initial coupling between ligand binding and channel gating in the human alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) has been investigated with targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) simulation. During the simulation, eight residues at the tip of the C-loop in two alternating subunits were forced to move toward a ligand-bound conformation as captured in the crystallographic structure of acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) in complex with carbamoylcholine. Comparison of apo- and ligand-bound AChBP structures shows only minor rearrangements distal from the ligand-binding site. In contrast, comparison of apo and TMD simulation structures of the nAChR reveals significant changes toward the bottom of the ligand-binding domain. These structural rearrangements are subsequently translated to the pore domain, leading to a partly open channel within 4 ns of TMD simulation. Furthermore, we confirmed that two highly conserved residue pairs, one located near the ligand-binding pocket (Lys145 and Tyr188), and the other located toward the bottom of the ligand-binding domain (Arg206 and Glu45), are likely to play important roles in coupling agonist binding to channel gating. Overall, our simulations suggest that gating movements of the alpha7 receptor may involve relatively small structural changes within the ligand-binding domain, implying that the gating transition is energy-efficient and can be easily modulated by agonist binding/unbinding.},

The free end of the polymer was covalently attached to a biotin molecule. On incorporation of the modified pore into a lipid bilayer, the biotinyl group moves from one side of the membrane to the other, and is detected by reversible capture with a mutant streptavidin. The capture events are observed as changes in ionic current passing through single pores in planar bilayers. Accordingly, the modified pore allows detection of a protein analyte at the single-molecule level, facilitating both quantification and identification through a distinctive current signature. The approach has higher time resolution compared with other kinetic measurements, such as those obtained by surface plasmon resonance.},

abstract = {Fast synaptic neurotransmission is mediated by transmitter-activated conformational changes in ligand-gated ion channel receptors, culminating in opening of the integral ion channel pore. Human hereditary hyperekplexia, or startle disease, is caused by mutations in both the intracellular or extracellular loops flanking the pore-lining M2 domain of the glycine receptor alpha1 subunit. These flanking domains are designated the M1-M2 loop and the M2-M3 loop respectively. We show that four startle disease mutations and six additional alanine substitution mutations distributed throughout both loops result in uncoupling of the ligand binding sites from the channel activation gate. We therefore conclude that the M1-M2 and M2-M3 loops act in parallel to activate the channel. Their locations strongly suggest that they act as hinges governing allosteric control of the M2 domain. As the members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily share a common structure, this signal transduction model may apply to all members of this superfamily.},

abstract = {The outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria provides an effective barrier to their often-harsh extracellular milieu. In particular, the outer leaflet of the OM is not a canonical monolayer of phospholipids. Rather, it is composed of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a molecule generally consisting of a core of Lipid A decorated with inner and outer core oligosaccharides. The oligosaccharides extend $\sim$30 � above the plane of the lipid headgroups of the outer leaflet. As such, it is an effective permeability barrier against potentially harmful compounds ( 1). However, obviously, permeability is required for bacterial survival; no bacterium is an island, as it were. For example, uptake of nutrients is essential, and OM transport proteins are required to conduct this function. The recent paper of Lepore et al. ( 2) has significantly extended our understanding of how hydrophobic molecules are transported across the OM. With rare exception (e.g., ref. 3), virtually all OM proteins are �-barrels, consisting of an even number of eight to twenty-four of �-strands forming a pore-like structure. Many of these OM pore-like �-barrels are classified as porins, and most nutrient uptake is accomplished by them. The effective aperture of the porin is dictated by the number of �-strands, and the aperture size then dictates the size (and shape) of the solutes that can diffuse through them. Porins function passively, permitting the energy-independent diffusion of solute molecules with a molecular mass of 600 Da or less downhill across a concentration gradient, through the porin's �-barrel, and into the periplasm. Another class of energy-independent OM transporters uses low-affinity binding sites that effectively serve to amplify small concentration gradients at the site of the transporter ( 4). One can envisage situations in which porins would be insufficient for nutrient .},

abstract = {Energy-consuming nanomachines catalyze the directed movement of biopolymers in the cell. They are found both dissolved in the aqueous cytosol as well as embedded in lipid bilayers. Inquiries into the molecular mechanism of nanomachine-catalyzed biopolymer transport have revealed that these machines are equipped with molecular parts, including adjustable clamps, levers, and adaptors, which interact favorably with substrate polypeptides. Biological nanomachines that catalyze protein transport, known as translocases, often require that their substrate proteins unfold before translocation. An unstructured protein chain is likely entropically challenging to bind, push, or pull in a directional manner, especially in a way that produces an unfolding force. A number of ingenious solutions to this problem are now evident in the anthrax toxin system, a model used to study protein translocation. Here we highlight molecular ratchets and current research on anthrax toxin translocation. A picture is emerging of proton-gradient-driven anthrax toxin translocation, and its associated ratchet mechanism likely applies broadly to other systems. We suggest a cyclical thermodynamic order-to-disorder mechanism (akin to a heat-engine cycle) is central to underlying protein translocation: peptide substrates nonspecifically bind to molecular clamps, which possess adjustable affinities; polypeptide substrates compress into helical structures; these clamps undergo proton-gated switching; and the substrate subsequently expands regaining its unfolded state conformational entropy upon translocation.},

Recently, we developed a high-throughput computational approach for the prediction of membrane protein/lipid interactions. In the current study, we enhanced this approach with the addition of a new measure of the distortion caused by membrane proteins on a lipid bilayer. This is illustrated by considering the effect of lipid tail length and headgroup charge on the distortion caused by the integral membrane proteins MscS and FLAP, and by the voltage sensing domain from the channel KvAP. Changing the chain length of lipids alters the extent but not the pattern of distortion caused by MscS and FLAP; lipid headgroups distort in order to interact with very similar but not identical regions in these proteins for all bilayer widths investigated. Introducing anionic lipids into a DPPC bilayer containing the KvAP voltage sensor does not affect the extent of bilayer distortion.},

We have developed a set of simple and physically motivated criteria for secondary structure, programmed as a pattern-recognition process of hydrogen-bonded and geometrical features extracted from x-ray coordinates. Cooperative secondary structure is recognized as repeats of the elementary hydrogen-bonding patterns turn and bridge. Repeating turns are helices, repeating bridges are ladders, connected ladders are sheets. Geometric structure is defined in terms of the concepts torsion and curvature of differential geometry. Local chain chirality is the torsional handedness of four consecutive C positions and is positive for right-handed helices and negative for ideal twisted -sheets. Curved pieces are defined as bends. Solvent exposure is given as the number of water molecules in possible contact with a residue. The end result is a compilation of the primary structure, including SS bonds, secondary structure, and solvent exposure of 62 different globular proteins. The presentation is in linear form: strip graphs for an overall view and strip tables for the details of each of 10.925 residues. The dictionary is also available in computer-readable form for protein structure prediction work.},

abstract = {Protein translocation across the bacterial membrane occurs at the SecY complex or channel. The resting SecY channel is impermeable to small molecules owing to a plug domain that creates a seal. Here, we report that a channel loosely sealed, or with a plug locked open, does not, however, lead to general membrane permeability. Instead, strong selectivity towards small monovalent anions, especially chloride, is observed. Mutations in the pore ring-structure increase both the translocation activity of the channel and its ionic conductance, however the selectivity is maintained. The same ionic specificity also occurs at the onset of protein translocation and across the archaeal SecY complex. Thus, the ion-conducting characteristic of the channel seems to be conserved as a normal consequence of protein translocation. We propose that the pore ring-structure forms a selectivity filter, allowing cells to tolerate channels with imperfect plugs.},

@article{Monari2013,
abstract = {Molecular mechanics methods can efficiently compute the macroscopic properties of a large molecular system but cannot represent the electronic changes that occur during a chemical reaction or an electronic transition. Quantum mechanical methods can accurately simulate these processes, but they require considerably greater computational resources. Because electronic changes typically occur in a limited part of the system, such as the solute in a molecular solution or the substrate within the active site of enzymatic reactions, researchers can limit the quantum computation to this part of the system. Researchers take into account the influence of the surroundings by embedding this quantum computation into a calculation of the whole system described at the molecular mechanical level, a strategy known as the mixed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach. The accuracy of this embedding varies according to the types of interactions included, whether they are purely mechanical or classically electrostatic. This embedding can also introduce the induced polarization of the surroundings. The difficulty in QM/MM calculations comes from the splitting of the system into two parts, which requires severing the chemical bonds that link the quantum mechanical subsystem to the classical subsystem. Typically, researchers replace the quantoclassical atoms, those at the boundary between the subsystems, with a monovalent link atom. For example, researchers might add a hydrogen atom when a C-C bond is cut. This Account describes another approach, the Local Self Consistent Field (LSCF), which was developed in our laboratory. LSCF links the quantum mechanical portion of the molecule to the classical portion using a strictly localized bond orbital extracted from a small model molecule for each bond. In this scenario, the quantoclassical atom has an apparent nuclear charge of +1. To achieve correct bond lengths and force constants, we must take into account the inner shell of the atom: for an sp(3) carbon atom, we consider the two core 1s electrons and treat that carbon as an atom with three electrons. This results in an LSCF+3 model. Similarly, a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons available for conjugation is treated as an atom with five electrons (LSCF+5). This approach is particularly well suited to splitting peptide bonds and other bonds that include carbon or nitrogen atoms. To embed the induced polarization within the calculation, researchers must use a polarizable force field. However, because the parameters of the usual force fields include an average of the induction effects, researchers typically can obtain satisfactory results without explicitly introducing the polarization. When considering electronic transitions, researchers must take into account the changes in the electronic polarization. One approach is to simulate the electronic cloud of the surroundings by a continuum whose dielectric constant is equal to the square of the refractive index. This Electronic Response of the Surroundings (ERS) methodology allows researchers to model the changes in induced polarization easily. We illustrate this approach by modeling the electronic absorption of tryptophan in human serum albumin (HSA).},

By means of atomic level molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we have performed a systematic investigation of KCl conductance in silica nanopores with a total simulation time of 680 ns.

These fluctuations degrade the higher order diffraction data in a way that, if unrecognized, leads to erroneous conclusions regarding bilayer structure. Diffraction measurements at high instrumental resolution provide a measure of these fluctuations. In addition to providing better structural determination, this opens a new window on interactions between bilayers, so the experimental determination of interbilayer interaction parameters is reviewed briefly. We introduce a new structural correction based on fluctuations that has not been included in any previous studies. Updated measurements, such as for the area compressibility modulus, are used to provide adjustments to many of the literature values of structural quantities. Since the gel (L$\beta$′) phase is valuable as a stepping stone for obtaining fluid phase results, a brief review is given of the lower temperature phases. The uncertainty in structural results for lipid bilayers is being reduced and best current values are provided for bilayers of five lipids.},

The valve consists of a channel protein, the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from Escherichia coli, modified by attachment of synthetic compounds that undergo light-induced charge separation to reversibly open and close a 3-nanometer pore. The system is compatible with a classical encapsulation system, the liposome, and external photochemical control over transport through the channel is achieved.},

We demonstrate that cloud computing is a viable alternative that brings long-timescale processes within reach of a broader community. We used Google's Exacycle cloud-computing platform to simulate two milliseconds of dynamics of a major drug target, the G-protein-coupled receptor $\beta$2AR. Markov state models aggregate independent simulations into a single statistical model that is validated by previous computational and experimental results. Moreover, our models provide an atomistic description of the activation of a G-protein-coupled receptor and reveal multiple activation pathways. Agonists and inverse agonists interact differentially with these pathways, with profound implications for drug design.},

abstract = {Four methods to compute the dielectric permittivity e of a liquid from molecular simulations are compared in the context of the simple point charge (SPC) water model. In the first method (unrestrained method), e is evaluated from the fluctuations of the box dipole moment M, monitored during a single equilibrium simulation. In the three other methods, e is evaluated from the probability distribution p( M) of the dipole moment norm. This distribution is itself evaluated in three different ways: (i) from multiple simulations involving a M-dependent biasing potential (umbrella-sampling method), (ii) from multiple simulations involving a constrained dipole moment norm (M-constraint method),or (iii) from fitting of incomplete p( M) estimates to a Maxwell distribution (fitting method). The four methods are shown to converge to an identical estimate of e=61+-1 for SPC water (256 molecules, reaction-field electrostatics). The convergence properties, advantages, and drawbacks of the different methods are analyzed in detail.},

abstract = {Water molecules confined to pores with sub-nanometre diameters form single-file hydrogen-bonded chains. In such nanoscale confinement, water has unusual physical properties that are exploited in biology and hold promise for a wide range of biomimetic and nanotechnological applications. The latter can be realized by carbon and boron nitride nanotubes which confine water in a relatively non-specific way and lend themselves to the study of intrinsic properties of single-file water. As a consequence of strong water-water hydrogen bonds, many characteristics of single-file water are conserved in biological and synthetic pores despite differences in their atomistic structures. Charge transport and orientational order in water chains depend sensitively on and are mainly determined by electrostatic effects. Thus, mimicking functions of biological pores with apolar pores and corresponding external fields gives insight into the structure-function relation of biological pores and allows the development of technical applications beyond the molecular devices found in living systems. In this Perspective, we revisit results for single-file water in apolar pores, and examine the similarities and the differences between these simple systems and water in more complex pores.},

abstract = {Five molecular dynamics simulations (total duration >25 ns) have been performed on the Escherichia coli outer membrane protease OmpT embedded in a dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine lipid bilayer. Globally the protein is conformationally stable. Some degree of tilt of the beta-barrel is observed relative to the bilayer plane. The greatest degree of conformational flexibility is seen in the extracellular loops. A complex network of fluctuating H-bonds is formed between the active site residues, such that the Asp210-His212 interaction is maintained throughout, whereas His212 and Asp83 are often bridged by a water molecule. This supports a catalytic mechanism whereby Asp83 and His212 bind a water molecule that attacks the peptide carbonyl. A configuration yielded by docking calculations of OmpT simulation snapshots and a model substrate peptide Ala-Arg-Arg-Ala was used as the starting point for an extended Huckel calculation on the docked peptide. These placed the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital mainly on the carbon atom of the central C=O in the scissile peptide bond, thus favoring attack on the central peptide by the water held by residues Asp83 and His212. The trajectories of water molecules reveal exchange of waters between the intracellular face of the membrane and the interior of the barrel but no exchange at the extracellular mouth. This suggests that the pore-like region in the center of OmpT may enable access of water to the active site from below. The simulations appear to reveal the presence of specific lipid interaction sites on the surface of the OmpT barrel. This reveals the ability of extended MD simulations to provide meaningful information on protein-lipid interactions.},

However, other structural elements, as yet largely ignored in statistical studies of membrane protein structure, are found in those parts of the protein that are located in the membrane-water interface region. Here, we show that this region is enriched in irregular structure and in interfacial helices running roughly parallel with the membrane surface, while beta-strands are extremely rare. The average amino acid composition is different between the interfacial helices, the parts of the transmembrane helices located in the interface region, and the irregular structures. In this region, hydrophobic and aromatic residues tend to point toward the membrane and charged/polar residues tend to point away from the membrane. The interface region thus imposes different constraints on protein structure than do the central hydrocarbon core of the membrane and the surrounding aqueous phase.},

These bacteria have a complex cell envelope that comprises an outer membrane and an inner membrane that delimit the periplasm. The outer membrane contains various protein channels, called porins, which are involved in the influx of various compounds, including several classes of antibiotics. Bacterial adaptation to reduce influx through porins is an increasing problem worldwide that contributes, together with efflux systems, to the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance. An exciting challenge is to decipher the genetic and molecular basis of membrane impermeability as a bacterial resistance mechanism. This Review outlines the bacterial response towards antibiotic stress on altered membrane permeability and discusses recent advances in molecular approaches that are improving our knowledge of the physico-chemical parameters that govern the translocation of antibiotics through porin channels.},

Below 10 MHz, this situation is well described by the established first-order theory which treats the cytoplasm and the external medium as pure conductors. At higher frequencies, capacitive properties of the cytoplasm and the external medium become increasingly important and thus must be accounted for. This leads to a broader, second-order model, which is treated in detail in this paper. Unlike the first-order model, this model shows that above 10 MHz, the membrane field amplification stops decreasing and levels off again in the range of tens (high-frequency plateau). Existence of the high-frequency plateau could have an important impact on present theories of high-frequency electric fields effects on cells and their membranes.},

abstract = {Thermodynamic stabilities are pivotal for understanding structure-function relationships of proteins, and yet such determinations are rare for membrane proteins. Moreover, the few measurements that are available have been conducted under very different experimental conditions, which compromises a straightforward extraction of physical principles underlying stability differences. Here, we have overcome this obstacle and provided structure-stability comparisons for multiple membrane proteins. This was enabled by measurements of the free energies of folding and the m values for the transmembrane proteins PhoP/PhoQ-activated gene product (PagP) and outer membrane protein W (OmpW) from Escherichia coli. Our data were collected in the same lipid bilayer and buffer system we previously used to determine those parameters for E. coli outer membrane phospholipase A (OmpLA). Biophysically, our results suggest that the stabilities of these proteins are strongly correlated to the water-to-bilayer transfer free energy of the lipid-facing residues in their transmembrane regions. We further discovered that the sensitivities of these membrane proteins to chemical denaturation, as judged by their m values, was consistent with that previously observed for water-soluble proteins having comparable differences in solvent exposure between their folded and unfolded states. From a biological perspective, our findings suggest that the folding free energies for these membrane proteins may be the thermodynamic sink that establishes an energy gradient across the periplasm, thus driving their sorting by chaperones to the outer membranes in living bacteria. Binding free energies of these outer membrane proteins with periplasmic chaperones support this energy sink hypothesis.},

abstract = {Anion/cation selectivity is a critical property of ion channels and underpins their physiological function. Recently, there have been numerous mutagenesis studies, which have mapped sites within the ion channel-forming segments of ligand-gated ion channels that are determinants of the ion selectivity. Site-directed mutations to specific amino acids within or flanking the M2 transmembrane segments of the anion-selective glycine, GABAA and GABAC receptors and the cation-selective nicotinic acetylcholine and serotonin (type 3) receptors have revealed discrete, equivalent regions within the ion channel that form the principal selectivity filter, leading to plausible molecular mechanisms and mathematical models to describe how ions preferentially permeate these channels. In particular, the dominant factor determining anion/cation selectivity seems to be the sign and exposure of charged amino acids lining the selectivity filter region of the open channel. In addition, the minimum pore diameter, which can be influenced by the presence of a local proline residue, also makes a contribution to such ion selectivity in LGICs with smaller diameters increasing anion/cation selectivity and larger ones decreasing it. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This ideal system provides a reference system with which\nto compare the behavior of water and ions in real porous materials\nsuch as zeolites, bucky tubes, and biological channels. We find that\nin channels of radii between 2.5 and 5.5 AA the water molecules form a\ncylindrical solvation shell inside the channel walls with some\nevidence of a second shell in the center of the largest channel. Not\nall protons are involved in hydrogen bonding and a number point toward\nthe walls. We attribute this to the concavity of the surface. When a\nsodium ion is added it tends to lie in the center of the channel where\nit can form the most complete solvation shell. Its diffusion rate\ndecreases in smaller channels until it moves too slowly in a channel\nof 2 AA radius to be detected in our simulations. This decrease is\nonly partly due to an increase in the mean square force on the ion. A\nrange of ions of different sizes were studied in a channel with radius\n3 AA. While the smaller of these ions (F{sup -}, Na{sup +}, and Ca{sup\n++}) lie preferentially in the center of the channel, larger ions\n(Cl{sup -}, I{sup -}, and Cs{sup +}) penetrate some way into the layer\nof water inside the wall and methane and ions with the charges turned\noff move next to the wall. Landau free energy analysis shows that this\nchange is due to the balance between entropy and energy. The behavior\nin smooth channels is quite the opposite of what has been observed in\nexperimental studies and simulations of Gramicidin (pore radius of 2\nAA), where Cs{sup +} lies closer to the center of the channel and\nNa{sup +} lies off the axis. This difference can be attributed to the\nspecific molecular structure of the gramicidin pores (e.g., the\npresence of carbonyl groups). As in bulk solutions, the mobilities of\nthe ions in smooth channels increase to a maximum with ion size and\ndecrease with increasing magnitude of the charge on the ion, while\nuncharged species diffuse much more rapidly and show a monotonic\ndecrease with size. This behavior is related to the characteristics of\nthe fluctuations of the forces on the solute molecules. (53 refs.)},

Among them, the sorting of lipoproteins to the outer membrane of Escherichia coli has been clarified in detail. The Lol system, composed of five proteins, catalyzes outer membrane sorting of lipoproteins. Various Lpt proteins have recently been identified as factors involved in the transport of lipopolysaccharide to the outer membrane, although the mechanism remains largely unknown. Proteins with alpha-helical membrane spanning segments are found in the inner membrane, whereas amphipathic beta-barrel proteins span the outer membrane. These beta-barrel proteins are inserted into the outer membranes through a central core protein BamA (YaeT) with the help of four outer membrane lipoproteins. In contrast, little is known about how phospholipids are transported to the outer membrane.},

It turns out that when one nanocone is gradually rotated with respect to the other, the molecular chains alter the size of the nanopore formed at the cone tips and control the flow rates of liquid pentane through it. The second model pore is formed by two carbon nanotubes joined by a cylindrical structure of antiparallel peptides. By application of a torque to one of the nanotubes, while holding the other, we can reversibly fold the peptides into forward or backward-twisted barrels. We have modified the internal residues in these barrels to make these pores selective and controllable. Eventually, we found a nanopore that in the two folded configurations has very different transmission rates for hydrated NH(3) molecules.},

abstract = {Experimental studies have shown that the magnitude of the shock-induced transmembrane potential (Vm) saturates with increasing electric field strength. This study uses a mathematical model to investigate the effects of electroporation and membrane kinetics on Vm in a cardiac fiber. The model consists of the core conductor equation for a one-dimensional fiber, where excitability is represented by the Luo-Rudy dynamic model (1994-1995) and electroporation is described by a membrane conductance that increases exponentially with Vm squared. For shocks delivered during the plateau of an action potential, the model reproduces the experimentally observed saturation of Vm with a root mean square error of 4.27% and a correlation coefficient of 0.9992. For shocks delivered during diastole, the saturation of Vm is qualitatively reproduced even when the sodium and calcium channels are inactivated. Quantitative replication of the response to diastolic shocks is hindered by the choice of electroporation parameters (optimized for shocks delivered during the plateau) and differences in the membrane kinetics between model and experiment. The complex behavior of Vm during large shocks is due to a combination of electroporation, electrotonus, propagation, and active membrane kinetics. The modeling results imply that the experimentally observed saturation of Vm is due to electroporation of the lipid bilayer.},

A combined Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Brownian Dynamics (GCMC/BD) algorithm offers a general approach to study ion permeation through wide molecular pores with a direct account of ion-ion and ion-DNA correlations. This work extends previously developed theory by incorporating the recently developed coarse-grain polymer model of DNA by de Pablo and colleagues [Knotts, T. A.; Rathore, N.; Schwartz, D. C.; de Pablo, J. J. J. Chem. Phys. 2007, 126] with explicit ions for simulations of polymer dynamics. Atomistic MD simulations were used to guide model developments. The power of the developed scheme is illustrated with studies of single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) oligomer translocation in two model cases: a cylindrical pore with a varying radius and a well-studied experimental system, the staphylococcal $\alpha$-hemolysin channel. The developed model shows good agreement with experimental data for model studies of two homopolymers: ss-poly(dA)(n) and ss-poly(dC)(n). The developed protocol allows for direct evaluation of different factors (charge distribution and pore shape and size) controlling DNA translocation in a variety of nanopores.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are key players in the early events of electrical signal transduction at chemical synapses. The family codes for a structurally conserved scaffold of channel proteins that open in response to the binding of neurotransmitter molecules. All proteins share a pentameric organization of identical or related subunits that consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain followed by a transmembrane channel domain. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the most thoroughly studied member of the pLGIC family (for recent reviews see refs 1-3). Two sources of structural information provided an architectural framework for the family. The structure of the soluble acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) defined the organization of the extracellular domain and revealed the chemical basis of ligand interaction. Electron microscopy studies of the nAChR from Torpedo electric ray have yielded a picture of the full-length protein and have recently led to the interpretation of an electron density map at 4.0 A resolution. Despite the wealth of experimental information, high-resolution structures of any family member have so far not been available. Until recently, the pLGICs were believed to be only expressed in multicellular eukaryotic organisms. The abundance of prokaryotic genome sequences, however, allowed the identification of several homologous proteins in bacterial sources. Here we present the X-ray structure of a prokaryotic pLGIC from the bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) at 3.3 A resolution. Our study reveals the first structure of a pLGIC at high resolution and provides an important model system for the investigation of the general mechanisms of ion permeation and gating within the family.},

The intrusion, which takes place above the bulk saturation pressure, can be well described using a macroscopic capillary model. Once the material is saturated with water, extrusion takes place upon reduction of the externally applied pressure. Our results for the extrusion pressure can only be understood by assuming that the limiting extrusion mechanism is the nucleation of a vapor bubble inside the pores. A comparison of calculated and experimental nucleation pressures shows that a proper inclusion of line tension effects is necessary to account for the observed values of nucleation barriers. Negative line tensions of order 10(-11) J m(-1) are found for our system, in reasonable agreement with other experimental estimates of this quantity.},

The three antibiotics are found to bind within the extracellular and periplasmic pore vestibules, away from the narrow OmpF constriction zone. Using the X-ray structures as a starting point, nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with an applied membrane voltage show that ionic current through the OmpF channel is blocked with bound ampicillin, but not with bound carbenicillin. The susceptibility of Escherichia coli expressing OmpF mutants to ampicillin and carbenicillin was also experimentally characterized using microbiologic assays. These results show that general diffusion by OmpF porins allows for transfer of molecules with varied charged states and give insights into the design of more efficient antibiotics.

The accuracy of such simulations, however, is critically dependent on the force field--the mathematical model used to approximate the atomic-level forces acting on the simulated molecular system. Here we present a systematic and extensive evaluation of eight different protein force fields based on comparisons of experimental data with molecular dynamics simulations that reach a previously inaccessible timescale. First, through extensive comparisons with experimental NMR data, we examined the force fields' abilities to describe the structure and fluctuations of folded proteins. Second, we quantified potential biases towards different secondary structure types by comparing experimental and simulation data for small peptides that preferentially populate either helical or sheet-like structures. Third, we tested the force fields' abilities to fold two small proteins--one $\alpha$-helical, the other with $\beta$-sheet structure. The results suggest that force fields have improved over time, and that the most recent versions, while not perfect, provide an accurate description of many structural and dynamical properties of proteins.},

Genetic defects in ClC Cl- channels underlie several familial muscle and kidney diseases. Here we present the X-ray structures of two prokaryotic ClC Cl- channels from Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and Escherichia coli at 3.0 and 3.5 A, respectively. Both structures reveal two identical pores, each pore being formed by a separate subunit contained within a homodimeric membrane protein. Individual subunits are composed of two roughly repeated halves that span the membrane with opposite orientations. This antiparallel architecture defines a selectivity filter in which a Cl- ion is stabilized by electrostatic interactions with alpha-helix dipoles and by chemical coordination with nitrogen atoms and hydroxyl groups. These findings provide a structural basis for further understanding the function of ClC Cl- channels, and establish the physical and chemical basis of their anion selectivity.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations were used to study the structure and dynamics of the Escherichia coli OmpF porin, which is composed of three identical 16-stranded beta-barrels. Simulations of the full trimer in the absence of water and the membrane led to significant contraction of the channel in the interior of each beta-barrel. With very weak harmonic constraints (0.005 kcal/mol A2/atom) applied to the main-chain C alpha atoms of the beta-barrel, the structure was stabilized without alteration of the average fluctuations. The resulting distribution of the fluctuations (small for beta-strands, large for loops and turns) is in good agreement with the x-ray B factors. Dynamic cross-correlation functions showed the importance of coupling between the loop motions and barrel flexibility. This was confirmed by the application of constraints corresponding to the observed temperature factors to the barrel C alpha atoms. With these constraints, the beta-barrel fluctuations were much smaller than the experimental values because of the intrinsic restrictions on the atomic motions, and the loop motions were reduced significantly. This result indicates that considerable care is required in introducing constraints to keep proteins close to the experimental structure during simulations, as has been done in several recent studies. Loop 3, which is thought to be important in gating the pore, undergoes a displacement that shifts it away from the x-ray structure. Analysis shows that this arises from the breakdown of a hydrogen bond network, which appears to result more from the absence of solvent that from the use of standard ionization states for the side chains of certain beta-barrel residues.},

Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18% overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen–oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self‐diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.},

abstract = {A large family of membrane channel proteins selective for transport of water (aquaporins) or water plus glycerol (aquaglyceroporins) has been found in diverse life forms. Escherichia coli has two members of this family-a water channel, AqpZ, and a glycerol facilitator, GlpF. Despite having similar primary amino acid sequences and predicted structures, the oligomeric state and solute selectivity of AqpZ and GlpF are disputed. Here we report biochemical and functional characterizations of affinity-purified GlpF and compare it to AqpZ. Histidine-tagged (His-GlpF) and hemagglutinin-tagged (HA-GlpF) polypeptides encoded by a bicistronic construct were expressed in bacteria. HA-GlpF and His-GlpF appear to form oligomers during Ni-nitrilotriacetate affinity purification. Sucrose gradient sedimentation analyses showed that the oligomeric state of octyl glucoside-solubilized GlpF varies: low ionic strength favors subunit dissociation, whereas Mg(2+) stabilizes tetrameric assembly. Reconstitution of affinity-purified GlpF into proteoliposomes increases glycerol permeability more than 100-fold and water permeability up to 10-fold compared with control liposomes. Glycerol and water permeability of GlpF both occur with low Arrhenius activation energies and are reversibly inhibited by HgCl(2). Our studies demonstrate that, unlike AqpZ, a water-selective stable tetramer, purified GlpF exists in multiple oligomeric forms under nondenaturing conditions and is highly permeable to glycerol but less well permeated by water.},

abstract = {The Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) model is based on a mean-field approximation of ion interactions and continuum descriptions of concentration and electrostatic potential. It provides qualitative explanation and increasingly quantitative predictions of experimental measurements for the ion transport problems in many areas such as semiconductor devices, nanofluidic systems, and biological systems, despite many limitations. While the PNP model gives a good prediction of the ion transport phenomenon for chemical, physical, and biological systems, the number of equations to be solved and the number of diffusion coefficient profiles to be determined for the calculation directly depend on the number of ion species in the system, since each ion species corresponds to one Nernst-Planck equation and one position-dependent diffusion coefficient profile. In a complex system with multiple ion species, the PNP can be computationally expensive and parameter demanding, as experimental measurements of diffusion coefficient profiles are generally quite limited for most confined regions such as ion channels, nanostructures and nanopores. We propose an alternative model to reduce number of Nernst-Planck equations to be solved in complex chemical and biological systems with multiple ion species by substituting Nernst-Planck equations with Boltzmann distributions of ion concentrations. As such, we solve the coupled Poisson-Boltzmann and Nernst-Planck (PBNP) equations, instead of the PNP equations. The proposed PBNP equations are derived from a total energy functional by using the variational principle. We design a number of computational techniques, including the Dirichlet to Neumann mapping, the matched interface and boundary, and relaxation based iterative procedure, to ensure efficient solution of the proposed PBNP equations. Two protein molecules, cytochrome c551 and Gramicidin A, are employed to validate the proposed model under a wide range of bulk ion concentrations and external voltages. Extensive numerical experiments show that there is an excellent consistency between the results predicted from the present PBNP model and those obtained from the PNP model in terms of the electrostatic potentials, ion concentration profiles, and current-voltage (I-V) curves. The present PBNP model is further validated by a comparison with experimental measurements of I-V curves under various ion bulk concentrations. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed PBNP model is more efficient than the original PNP model in terms of simulation time.},

In addition to ionic conductance, the channels allow free diffusion of small, uncharged molecules. Channels assume either an open or a closed state. Membrane potentials shift this two-state equilibrium distribution in favor of closed channels, an observation that explains both negative resistance and inactivation at high potentials. Channels are not randomly distributed in the membrane but interact cooperatively within aggregates. The smallest entity inducible consists of three channels.},

A number of aromatic amino acids have been identified as contributing to the agonist binding site, suggesting that cation-pi interactions may be involved in binding the quaternary ammonium group of the agonist, acetylcholine. Here we show a compelling correlation between: (i) ab initio quantum mechanical predictions of cation-pi binding abilities and (ii) EC50 values for acetylcholine at the receptor for a series of tryptophan derivatives that were incorporated into the receptor by using the in vivo nonsense-suppression method for unnatural amino acid incorporation. Such a correlation is seen at one, and only one, of the aromatic residues-tryptophan-149 of the alpha subunit. This finding indicates that, on binding, the cationic, quaternary ammonium group of acetylcholine makes van der Waals contact with the indole side chain of alpha tryptophan-149, providing the most precise structural information to date on this receptor. Consistent with this model, a tethered quaternary ammonium group emanating from position alpha149 produces a constitutively active receptor.},

Several techniques are employed to crystallize membrane proteins, and the bulk of these techniques make direct use of solubilized protein-surfactant complexes by the more traditional, so-called in surfo methods. An alternative in meso approach, which employs a bicontinuous lipidic mesophase, has emerged as a method with considerable promise in part because it involves reconstitution of the solubilized protein back into a stabilizing and organizing lipid bilayer reservoir as a prelude to crystallogenesis. A hypothesis for how the method works at the molecular level and experimental evidence in support of the proposal are reviewed here. The latest advances, successes, and challenges associated with the method are described.},

abstract = {To learn about the mechanism of ion charge selectivity by invertebrate glutamate-gated chloride (GluCl) channels, we swapped segments between the GluClbeta receptor of Caenorhabditis elegans and the vertebrate cationic alpha7-acetylcholine receptor and monitored anionic/cationic permeability ratios. Complete conversion of the ion charge selectivity in a set of receptor microchimeras indicates that the selectivity filter of the GluClbeta receptor is created by a sequence connecting the first with the second transmembrane segments. A single substitution of a negatively charged residue within this sequence converted the selectivity of the GluClbeta receptor's pore from anionic to cationic. Unexpectedly, elimination of the charge of each basic residue of the selectivity filter, one at a time or concomitantly, moderately reduced the P(Cl)/P(Na) ratios, but the GluClbeta receptor's mutants retained high capacity to select Cl(-) over Na(+). These results indicate that, unlike the proposed case of anionic Gly- and gamma-aminobutyric acid-gated ion channels, positively charged residues do not play the key role in the selection of ionic charge by the GluClbeta receptor. Taken together with measurements of the effective open pore diameter and with structural modeling, the study presented here collectively indicates that in the most constricted part of the open GluClbeta receptor's channel, Cl(-) interacts with backbone amides, where it undergoes partial dehydration necessary for traversing the pore.},

abstract = {General anaesthetics have enjoyed long and widespread use but their molecular mechanism of action remains poorly understood. There is good evidence that their principal targets are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) such as inhibitory GABA(A) ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid) receptors and excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are respectively potentiated and inhibited by general anaesthetics. The bacterial homologue from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC), whose X-ray structure was recently solved, is also sensitive to clinical concentrations of general anaesthetics. Here we describe the crystal structures of the complexes propofol/GLIC and desflurane/GLIC. These reveal a common general-anaesthetic binding site, which pre-exists in the apo-structure in the upper part of the transmembrane domain of each protomer. Both molecules establish van der Waals interactions with the protein; propofol binds at the entrance of the cavity whereas the smaller, more flexible, desflurane binds deeper inside. Mutations of some amino acids lining the binding site profoundly alter the ionic response of GLIC to protons, and affect its general-anaesthetic pharmacology. Molecular dynamics simulations, performed on the wild type (WT) and two GLIC mutants, highlight differences in mobility of propofol in its binding site and help to explain these effects. These data provide a novel structural framework for the design of general anaesthetics and of allosteric modulators of brain pLGICs.},

Crystal structures of the bacterial homologue, LeuT, in substrate-bound outward-occluded and competitive inhibitor-bound outward-facing states have advanced our mechanistic understanding of neurotransmitter sodium symporters but have left fundamental questions unanswered. Here we report crystal structures of LeuT mutants in complexes with conformation-specific antibody fragments in the outward-open and inward-open states. In the absence of substrate but in the presence of sodium the transporter is outward-open, illustrating how the binding of substrate closes the extracellular gate through local conformational changes: hinge-bending movements of the extracellular halves of transmembrane domains 1, 2 and 6, together with translation of extracellular loop 4. The inward-open conformation, by contrast, involves large-scale conformational changes, including a reorientation of transmembrane domains 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7, a marked hinge bending of transmembrane domain 1a and occlusion of the extracellular vestibule by extracellular loop 4. These changes close the extracellular gate, open an intracellular vestibule, and largely disrupt the two sodium sites, thus providing a mechanism by which ions and substrate are released to the cytoplasm. The new structures establish a structural framework for the mechanism of neurotransmitter sodium symporters and their modulation by therapeutic and illicit substances.},

abstract = {Membrane-integrated type II phosphatidic acid phosphatases (PAP2s) are important for numerous bacterial to human biological processes, including glucose transport, lipid metabolism, and signaling. Escherichia coli phosphatidylglycerol-phosphate phosphatase B (ecPgpB) catalyzes removing the terminal phosphate group from a lipid carrier, undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, and is essential for transport of many hydrophilic small molecules across the membrane. We determined the crystal structure of ecPgpB at a resolution of 3.2 \AA. This structure shares a similar folding topology and a nearly identical active site with soluble PAP2 enzymes. However, the substrate binding mechanism appears to be fundamentally different from that in soluble PAP2 enzymes. In ecPgpB, the potential substrate entrance to the active site is located in a cleft formed by a V-shaped transmembrane helix pair, allowing lateral movement of the lipid substrate entering the active site from the membrane lipid bilayer. Activity assays of point mutations confirmed the importance of the catalytic residues and potential residues involved in phosphate binding. The structure also suggests an induced-fit mechanism for the substrate binding.

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to study the transport of water and ions through pores created on the basal plane of one graphene sheet (GS). Graphene pore diameters ranged from 7.5 to 14.5 \AA. Different pore functionalities were considered, obtained by tethering various functional groups to the terminal carbon atoms. The ease of ion and water translocation across the pores was monitored by calculating the potential of mean force along the direction perpendicular to the GS pore. The results indicate that effective ion exclusion can be achieved only using nonfunctionalized (pristine) pores of diameter $\sim$7.5 \AA, whereas the ions can easily penetrate pristine pores of diameters $\sim$10.5 and 14.5 \AA. Carboxyl functional groups can enhance ion exclusion for all pores considered, but the effect becomes less pronounced as both the ion concentration and the pore diameter increase. When compared to a carbon nanotube of similar pore diameter, our results suggest that GS pores functionalized with COO(-) groups are more effective in excluding Cl(-) ions from passing through the membrane. Our results suggest that narrow graphene pores functionalized with hydroxyl groups remain effective at excluding Cl(-) ions even at moderate solution ionic strength. The results presented could be useful for the design of water desalination membranes.},

At room temperature the resulting adsorption isotherms in (10:10) and wider single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNs) are characterized by negligible water uptake at low pressures, sudden and complete pore filling once a threshold pressure is reached, and wide adsorption/desorption hysteresis loops. The width of the hysteresis loops decreases as pore diameter narrows and it becomes negligible for water adsorption in (8:8) and (6:6) SWCNs. Results for the isosteric heat of adsorption, density profiles along the pore axis and across the pore radii, order parameter across the pore radii, and x-ray diffraction patterns are presented. Layered structures are observed when the internal diameter of the nanotubes is commensurate to the establishment of a hydrogen-bonded network. The structure of water in (8:8) and (10:10) SWCNs is ordered when the temperature is 298 and 248 K, respectively. By simulating adsorption isotherms at various temperatures, the hysteresis critical temperature, e.g., the lowest temperature at which no hysteresis can be detected, is determined for water adsorbed in (20:20), (12:12), and (10:10) SWCNs. The hysteresis critical temperature is lower than the vapor-liquid critical temperature for bulk Simple Point Charge-Extended (SPCE) water model.},

abstract = {Understanding the binding and insertion of peptides in lipid bilayers is a prerequisite for understanding phenomena such as antimicrobial activity and membrane-protein folding. We describe molecular dynamics simulations of the antimicrobial peptide alamethicin in lipid/water and octane/water environments, taking into account an external electric field to mimic the membrane potential. At cis-positive potentials, alamethicin does not insert into a phospholipid bilayer in 10 ns of simulation, due to the slow dynamics of the peptide and lipids. However, in octane N-terminal insertion occurs at field strengths from 0.33 V/nm and higher, in simulations of up to 100 ns duration. Insertion of alamethicin occurs in two steps, corresponding to desolvation of the Gln7 side chain, and the backbone of Aib10 and Gly11. The proline induced helix kink angle does not change significantly during insertion. Polyalanine and alamethicin form stable helices both when inserted in octane and at the water/octane interface, where they partition in the same location. In water, both polyalanine and alamethicin partially unfold in multiple simulations. We present a detailed analysis of the insertion of alamethicin into the octane slab and the influence of the external field on the peptide structure. Our findings give new insight into the mechanism of channel formation by alamethicin and the structure and dynamics of membrane-associated helices.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electroporation is a common method to introduce foreign molecules into cells, but its molecular basis is poorly understood. Here I investigate the mechanism of pore formation by direct molecular dynamics simulations of phospholipid bilayers of a size of 256 and of more than 2000 lipids as well as simulations of simpler interface systems with applied electric fields of different strengths. RESULTS: In a bilayer of 26 x 29 nm multiple pores form independently with sizes of up to 10 nm on a time scale of nanoseconds with an applied field of 0.5 V/nm. Pore formation is accompanied by curving of the bilayer. In smaller bilayers of ca. 6 x 6 nm, a single pore forms on a nanosecond time scale in lipid bilayers with applied fields of at least 0.4 V/nm, corresponding to transmembrane voltages of ca. 3 V. The presence of 1 M salt does not seem to change the mechanism. In an even simpler system, consisting of a 3 nm thick octane layer, pores also form, despite the fact that there are no charged headgroups and no salt in this system. In all cases pore formation begins with the formation of single-file like water defects penetrating into the bilayer or octane. CONCLUSIONS: The simulations suggest that pore formation is driven by local electric field gradients at the water/lipid interface. Water molecules move in these field gradients, which increases the probability of water defects penetrating into the bilayer interior. Such water defects cause a further increase in the local electric field, accelerating the process of pore formation. The likelihood of pore formation appears to be increased by local membrane defects involving lipid headgroups. Simulations with and without salt show little difference in the observed pore formation process. The resulting pores are hydrophilic, lined by phospholipid headgroups.},

It begins with a brief history of soft nanotechnology. This history has followed a path involving a gradual shift from the promise of revolutionary electronics, nanorobotics, and other futuristic concepts, to the realization of evolutionary improvements in the technology for current challenges in information technology, medicine, and sustainability. Soft nanoscience is an area that is occupied principally by chemists, and is in many ways indistinguishable from "nanochemistry". The paper identifies the natural tendency of its practitioners--exemplified by the speakers at this Faraday Discussion--to focus on synthesis and structure, rather than on function and application, of nanostructures. Soft nanotechnology has the potential to apply to a wide variety of large-scale applied (information technology, healthcare cost reduction, sustainability, energy) and fundamental (molecular biochemistry, cell biology, charge transport in organic matter) problems.},

Complementing the experimental study of Bai and co-workers (J. Am. Chem. Soc.2007, 129, 14981), here we characterize ion atmosphere around double-stranded DNA through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that our improved parametrization of the all-atom model can quantitatively reproduce the experimental ion-count data. Our simulations determine the size of the ion atmosphere, the concentration profiles of ionic species competing to neutralize the DNA charge, and the sites of the cations' preferential binding at the surface of double-stranded DNA. We find that the effective size of the ion atmosphere depends on both the bulk concentration and valence of ions: increasing either reduces the size of the atmosphere. Near DNA, the concentration of Mg(2+) is strongly enhanced compared to monovalent cations. Within the DNA grooves, the relative concentrations of cations depend on their bulk values. Nevertheless, the total charge of competing cations buried in the DNA grooves is constant and compensates for about $\sim$30% of the total DNA charge.},

abstract = {Fast synaptic neurotransmission is mediated by transmitter-activated conformational changes in ligand-gated ion channel receptors, culminating in opening of the integral ion channel pore. Human hereditary hyperekplexia, or startle disease, is caused by mutations in both the intracellular or extracellular loops flanking the pore-lining M2 domain of the glycine receptor alpha1 subunit. These flanking domains are designated the M1-M2 loop and the M2-M3 loop respectively. We show that four startle disease mutations and six additional alanine substitution mutations distributed throughout both loops result in uncoupling of the ligand binding sites from the channel activation gate. We therefore conclude that the M1-M2 and M2-M3 loops act in parallel to activate the channel. Their locations strongly suggest that they act as hinges governing allosteric control of the M2 domain. As the members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily share a common structure, this signal transduction model may apply to all members of this superfamily.},

With increasing availability of structural data for well-studied proteins in different forms (liganded, complexed, or free), there is increasing evidence in support of the correspondence between functional changes in structures observed in experiments and the global motions predicted by these coarse-grained analyses.

abstract = {The ion-coupled processes that occur in the plasma membrane regulate the cell machineries in all the living organisms. The details of the chemical events that allow ion transport in biological systems remain elusive. However, investigations of the structure and function of natural and artificial transporters has led to increasing insights about the conductance mechanisms. Since the publication of the first successful artificial system by Tabushi and co-workers in 1982, synthetic chemists have designed and constructed a variety of chemically diverse and effective low molecular weight ionophores. Despite their relative structural simplicity, ionophores must satisfy several requirements. They must partition in the membrane, interact specifically with ions, shield them from the hydrocarbon core of the phospholipid bilayer, and transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other. All these attributes require amphipathic molecules in which the polar donor set used for ion recognition (usually oxygens for cations and hydrogen bond donors for anions) is arranged on a lipophilic organic scaffold. Playing with these two structural motifs, donor atoms and scaffolds, researchers have constructed a variety of different ionophores, and we describe a subset of interesting examples in this Account. Despite the ample structural diversity, structure/activity relationships studies reveal common features. Even when they include different hydrophilic moieties (oxyethylene chains, free hydroxyl, etc.) and scaffolds (steroid derivatives, neutral or polar macrocycles, etc.), amphipathic molecules, that cannot span the entire phospholipid bilayer, generate defects in the contact zone between the ionophore and the lipids and increase the permeability in the bulk membrane. Therefore, topologically complex structures that span the entire membrane are needed to elicit channel-like and ion selective behaviors. In particular the alternate-calix[4]arene macrocycle proved to be a versatile platform to obtain 3D-structures that can form unimolecular channels in membranes. In these systems, the selection of proper donor groups allows us to control the ion selectivity of the process. We can switch from cation to anion transport by substituting protonated amines for the oxygen donors. Large and stable tubular structures with nanometric sized transmembrane nanopores that provide ample internal space represent a different approach for the preparation of synthetic ion channels. We used the metal-mediated self-assembly of porphyrin ligands with Re(I) corners as a new method for producing to robust channel-like structures. Such structures can survive in the complex membrane environment and show interesting ionophoric behavior. In addition to the development of new design principles, the selective modification of the biological membrane permeability could lead to important developments in medicine and technology.},

To better understand the current-voltage (I-V) dependence of ion channels, here we describe and prove a collective diffusion model that quantitatively relates the spontaneous ion permeation at equilibrium to the stationary ionic fluxes driven by small voltages. The model makes it possible to determine the channel conductance in the linear I-V range from equilibrium simulations without the application of a voltage. To validate the theory, we perform molecular-dynamics simulations on two channels-a conical-shaped nanopore and the transmembrane pore of an $\alpha$-hemolysin-under both equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. The simulations reveal substantial couplings between the motions of cations and anions, which are effectively captured by the collective coordinate in the model. Although the two channels exhibit very different linear ranges in the I-V curves, in both cases the channel conductance at small voltages is in reasonable agreement with the prediction from the equilibrium simulation. The simulations also suggest that channel charges, rather than geometric asymmetry, play a more prominent role in current rectification.},

abstract = {Phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP(2)) is an activator of mammalian inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels. Multiscale simulations, via a sequential combination of coarse-grained and atomistic molecular dynamics, enabled exploration of the interactions of PIP(2) molecules within the inner leaflet of a lipid bilayer membrane with possible binding sites on Kir channels. Three Kir channel structures were investigated: X-ray structures of KirBac1.1 and of a Kir3.1-KirBac1.3 chimera and a homology model of Kir6.2. Coarse-grained simulations of the Kir channels in PIP(2)-containing lipid bilayers identified the PIP(2)-binding site on each channel. These models of the PIP(2)-channel complexes were refined by conversion to an atomistic representation followed by molecular dynamics simulation in a lipid bilayer. All three channels were revealed to contain a conserved binding site at the N-terminal end of the slide (M0) helix, at the interface between adjacent subunits of the channel. This binding site agrees with mutagenesis data and is in the proximity of the site occupied by a detergent molecule in the Kir chimera channel crystal. Polar contacts in the coarse-grained simulations corresponded to long-lived electrostatic and H-bonding interactions between the channel and PIP(2) in the atomistic simulations, enabling identification of key side chains.},

abstract = {The transmembrane potential generated by an alternating electric field (ac) depends strongly on the frequency of the field and can be calculated using the Schwan Equation. We have measured the critical electric breakdown potential, delta psi crit, of the plasma membrane of murine myeloma cell line (Tib9) using ac fields, by monitoring the entry of a fluorescence probe, propidium iodide, into the cells. This dye is weakly fluorescent in solution but becomes strongly fluorescent when it binds to DNA. Experiments were done under a microscope by direct visual examination of single cells or by examining photographic prints. When an ac field reached the intensity, Ecrit, that generated a maximal membrane potential delta psi max, equal to or greater than the delta psi crit, the membrane was perforated at the two loci facing the electrodes. The dye diffused into the cell, giving rise to two bright, narrow bands, which expanded to the whole cell in 1-3 min. delta psi crit's were measured in three media of different resistivities, rho ext, (52,600, 7,050, and 2,380 omega cm), over the range of 0.1-300 kHz, with the field duration of 200 ms. Regression analysis based on the Schwan Equation showed that in a medium of given resistivity, the delta psi crit was constant over the frequency range studied. When the capacitance of the membrane, Cmembr, was taken to be 0.90 microF cm-2, the resistivity of the cytoplasmic medium, rho int, was determined to be 910-1,100 omega cm. The delta psi crit were 0.33, 0.48, and 0.53 V, respectively, for the three media in decreasing resistivities. The good fit of these data to the curves calculated using the Schwan Equation indicates that the equation may be used to describe the transmembrane potential of a living cell generated by an oscillating electric field.},

Although the field-generated torque tilts the mean head group dipole a few degrees away from its equilibrium, zero-field position relative to the bilayer plane, this change in conformation does not appear to contribute directly to the development of the pore-initiating aggregation of lipid head groups and water that leads to the formation of a membrane-spanning hydrophilic pore. Field-directed rotation of the head group dipoles in the plane of the incipient pore wall, in combination with water dipole and solvation interactions at the aqueous-lipid interface, is one component in the coordinated ensemble of electroporation events.},

Membrane damage was demonstrated by the lysis of erythrocytes and protoplasts, the leakage of intracellular contents, the loss of the ability of Escherichia coli to plasmolyze in a hypertonic medium and the release of $\beta$-galactosidase activity in a permease-negative mutant of E. coli. In a suspension of Staphylococcus aureus the number of cells killed by an electric field correlated with the number that could not be converted to spheroplasts.2.2. Spores of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus polymyxa were resistant to electric field strengths up to 30 kV cm. The development of sensitivity during germination and outgrowth was due to the emergence of the vegetative cell from the protection afforded by the spore coat and cortex layers.3.3. The d.c.-pulse treatment caused loss of motility and synthesis of the induced enzyme $\beta$-galactosidase in vegetative bacteria, but no inhibitions were demonstrated with a number of isolated enzyme activities.4.4. It is proposed that the electric field causes an irreversible loss of the membrane's function as the semipermeable barrier between the bacterial cell and its environment, and that this is the cause of cell death.},

Biomimetic strategies offer new opportunities to investigate this remarkable transport phenomenon. Here, we show selective transport of proteins across individual biomimetic nuclear pore complexes at the single-molecule level. Each biomimetic complex is constructed by covalently tethering either Nup98 or Nup153 (phenylalanine-glycine (FG) nucleoporins) to a solid-state nanopore. Individual translocation events are monitored using ionic current measurements with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. Transport receptors (Imp$\beta$) proceed with a dwell time of ∼2.5 ms for both Nup98- and Nup153-coated pores, whereas the passage of non-specific proteins is strongly inhibited with different degrees of selectivity. For pores up to ∼25 nm in diameter, Nups form a dense and low-conducting barrier, whereas they adopt a more open structure in larger pores. Our biomimetic nuclear pore complex provides a quantitative platform for studying nucleocytoplasmic transport phenomena at the single-molecule level in vitro.},

Therefore, it should be possible to build any structure from a combination of existing Smotifs with the help of limited experimental data that are sufficient to relate the backbone conformations of Smotifs between target proteins and known structures. Here, we present a hybrid modeling algorithm that relies on an exhaustive Smotif library and on nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift patterns without any input of primary sequence information. In a test of 102 proteins, the algorithm delivered 90 homology-model-quality models, among them 24 high-quality ones, and a topologically correct solution for almost all cases. The current approach opens a venue to address the modeling of larger protein structures for which chemical shifts are available.},

Consistent with these models, two arginine residues (Arg(436) and Arg(440)) within the MA helix of 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3A (5-HT3A) receptors act singularly as rate-limiting determinants of single-channel conductance ($\gamma$). However, there is little conservation in primary amino acid sequences across the cytoplasmic loops of Cys-loop receptors, limiting confidence in the fidelity of this particular aspect of the 5-HT3A receptor model. We probed the majority of residues within the MA helix of the human 5-HT3A subunit using alanine- and arginine-scanning mutagenesis and the substituted cysteine accessibility method to determine their relative influences upon $\gamma$. Numerous residues, prominently those at the 435, 436, 439, and 440 positions, were found to markedly influence $\gamma$. This approach yielded a functional map of the 5-HT3A receptor portals, which agrees well with the homology model.},

We have investigated the adhesion degradation of silicon nitride/OSG and silicon carbonitride/OSG interfaces caused by water diffusion. Experimental results are in good quantitative agreement with an analytical model that combines water diffusion with subcritical crack growth. Fracture experiments show that water diffusion in OSG film stacks is remarkably fast and that it has an activation energy of 0.27 eV. The adhesion degradation is completely reversible under mild annealing conditions. Interfacial plasma treatments result in a significant enhancement of the adhesion in the absence of water, but this enhancement is lost almost completely upon exposure of the film stack to water. A diffusion study using deuterium as an isotopic tracer shows that the Si/OSG interface is the main diffusion path. ?? 2007 Acta Materialia Inc.},

Solid-state nanopores offer advantages in stability and tunability, but a scalable method for creating nanometer-thin solid-state pores has yet to be demonstrated. Here we demonstrate that solid-state nanopores with nanometer-thin constrictions can be produced by "cold ion beam sculpting," an original method that is broadly applicable to many materials, is easily scalable, and requires only modest instrumentation.},

abstract = {Ligand-gated ion channels are integral membrane proteins that mediate fast synaptic transmission. Molecular biological techniques have been extensively used for determining the structure-function relationships of ligand-gated ion channels. However, the transduction mechanisms that link agonist binding to channel gating remain poorly understood. Arginine 222 (Arg-222), located at the distal end of the extracellular N-terminal domain immediately preceding the first transmembrane domain (TM1), is conserved in all 5-HT3A receptors and alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that have been cloned. To elucidate the possible role of Arg-222 in the function of 5-HT3A receptors, we mutated the arginine residue to alanine (Ala) and expressed both the wild-type and the mutant receptor in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Functional studies of expressed wild-type and mutant receptors revealed that the R222A mutation increased the apparent potency of the full agonist, serotonin (5-HT), and the partial agonist, 2-Me-5-HT, 5- and 12-fold, respectively. In addition, the mutation increased the efficacy of 2-Me-5-HT and converted it from a partial agonist to a full agonist. Furthermore, this mutation also converted the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist/very weak partial agonist, apomorphine, to a potent agonist. Kinetic analysis revealed that the R222A mutation increased the rate of receptor activation and desensitization but did not affect rate of deactivation. The results suggest that the pre-TM1 amino acid residue Arg-222 may be involved in the transduction mechanism linking agonist binding to channel gating in 5-HT3A receptors.},

The formation of ion pairs call affect the separation efficiency and we discuss the Conditions under which perfect separation can be obtained.},

Two crystal structures of FadL, the long-chain fatty acid transporter from Escherichia coli, were recently determined, showing a novel fold characterized by the combination of a 14-stranded ?? barrel and a 'hatch' domain that plugs the barrel. Both crystal forms have several bound detergent molecules in the interior of the protein. This, together with differences between the N-terminal conformations of the FadL structures, has led to the proposal of a transport model that is distinct from those of all other known outer membrane transporters. According to this model, the transport of hydrophobic substrates across the outer membrane, as mediated by FadL family members, is based on diffusion, coupled to spontaneous conformational changes in the hatch domain. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Urea uptake is greatly enhanced and regulated by HpUreI, a proton-gated inner membrane channel protein essential for gastric survival of H. pylori. The crystal structure of HpUreI describes a static snapshot of the channel with two constriction sites near the center of the bilayer that are too narrow to allow passage of urea or even water. Here we describe the urea transport mechanism at atomic resolution, revealed by unrestrained microsecond equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of the hexameric channel assembly. Two consecutive constrictions open to allow conduction of urea, which is guided through the channel by interplay between conserved residues that determine proton rejection and solute selectivity. Remarkably, HpUreI conducts water at rates equivalent to aquaporins, which might be essential for efficient transport of urea at small concentration gradients.},

Only single molecule methods, fluorescence and force spectroscopy, allow observing individual molecules along their folding pathway. Here we observe that single-nanopore recording can be used as a new single molecule method to explore the unfolding transition and to examine the conformational space of native or variant proteins. We show that we can distinguish unfolded states from partially folded ones with the aerolysin pore. The unfolding transition curves of the destabilized variant are shifted toward the lower values of the denaturant agent compared to the wild type protein. The dynamics of the partially unfolded wild type protein follows a first-order transition. The denaturation curve obtained with the aerolysin pore is similar to that obtained with the $\alpha$-hemolysin pore. The nanopore geometry or net charge does not influence the folding transition but changes the dynamics.},

abstract = {Various strains of bacteria are able to produce a unique class of functional amyloids termed curli, which are critical for biofilm formation, host cell adhesion, and colonization of inert surfaces. Curli are secreted via the type VIII bacterial secretion system, and they share biochemical and structural characteristics with amyloid fibers that have been implicated in deleterious disease in humans. Here, we report the crystal structure of Escherichia coli CsgG, which is an essential lipoprotein component of the type VIII secretion system and which forms a secretion channel in the bacterial outer membrane for transporting curli subunits. CsgG forms a crown-shaped, symmetric nonameric channel that spans the outer membrane via a 36-strand $\beta$-barrel, with each subunit contributing four $\beta$-strands. This nonameric complex contains a central channel with a pore located at the middle. The eyelet of the pore is ∼12 \AA in diameter and is lined with three stacked nine-residue rings consisting of Tyr-66, Asn-70, or Phe-71. Our structure-based functional studies suggest that Tyr-66 and Phe-71 residues function as gatekeepers for the selective secretion of curli subunits. Our study describes in detail, to our knowledge, the first core structure of the type VIII bacterial secretion machinery. Importantly, our structural analysis suggests that the curli subunits are secreted via CsgG across the bacterial outer membrane in an unfolded form.},

abstract = {To understand the molecular mechanism of ion permeation in pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGIC), we solved the structure of an open form of GLIC, a prokaryotic pLGIC, at 2.4 \AA. Anomalous diffraction data were used to place bound anions and cations. This reveals ordered water molecules at the level of two rings of hydroxylated residues (named Ser6' and Thr2') that contribute to the ion selectivity filter. Two water pentagons are observed, a self-stabilized ice-like water pentagon and a second wider water pentagon, with one sodium ion between them. Single-channel electrophysiology shows that the side-chain hydroxyl of Ser6' is crucial for ion translocation. Simulations and electrostatics calculations complemented the description of hydration in the pore and suggest that the water pentagons observed in the crystal are important for the ion to cross hydrophobic constriction barriers. Simulations that pull a cation through the pore reveal that residue Ser6' actively contributes to ion translocation by reorienting its side chain when the ion is going through the pore. Generalization of these findings to the pLGIC family is proposed.},

Here, we describe forward and reverse ratcheting of DNA templates through the $\alpha$-hemolysin nanopore controlled by phi29 DNA polymerase without the need for active voltage control. DNA strands were ratcheted through the pore at median rates of 2.5-40 nucleotides per second and were examined at one nucleotide spatial precision in real time. Up to 500 molecules were processed at ∼130 molecules per hour through one pore. The probability of a registry error (an insertion or deletion) at individual positions during one pass along the template strand ranged from 10% to 24.5% without optimization. This strategy facilitates multiple reads of individual strands and is transferable to other nanopore devices for implementation of DNA sequence analysis.},

abstract = {We report nanoscale patterning of graphene using a helium ion microscope configured for lithography. Helium ion lithography is a direct-write lithography process, comparable to conventional focused ion beam patterning, with no resist or other material contacting the sample surface. In the present application, graphene samples on Si/SiO2 substrates are cut using helium ions, with computer controlled alignment, patterning, and exposure. Once suitable beam doses are determined, sharp edge profiles and clean etching are obtained, with little evident damage or doping to the sample. This technique provides fast lithography compatible with graphene, with approximately 15 nm feature sizes.},

abstract = {Nanosecond, megavolt-per-meter pulses--higher power but lower total energy than the electroporative pulses used to introduce normally excluded material into biological cells--produce large intracellular electric fields without destructively charging the plasma membrane. Nanoelectropulse perturbation of mammalian cells causes translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) to the outer face of the cell, intracellular calcium release, and in some cell types a subsequent progression to apoptosis. Experimental observations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of membranes in pulsed electric fields presented here support the hypothesis that nanoelectropulse-induced PS externalization is driven by the electric potential that appears across the lipid bilayer during a pulse and is facilitated by the poration of the membrane that occurs even during pulses as brief as 3 ns. MD simulations of phospholipid bilayers in supraphysiological electric fields show a tight association between PS externalization and membrane pore formation on a nanosecond time scale that is consistent with experimental evidence for electropermeabilization and anode-directed PS translocation after nanosecond electric pulse exposure, suggesting a molecular mechanism for nanoelectroporation and nanosecond PS externalization: electrophoretic migration of the negatively charged PS head group along the surface of nanometer-diameter electropores initiated by field-driven alignment of water dipoles at the membrane interface.},

abstract = {The in vitro study of membrane proteins for the purpose of physicochemical analysis or structure determination often relies upon successful reconstitution into detergent micelles. Moreover, a number of biological processes such as membrane protein folding and transport rely on lipid interactions which may resemble the micellar environment. Little is known about the structures of these micelles or the processes which lead to their formation. We therefore present two 50 ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of spontaneous dodecylphosphocholine micelle formation around representatives of the two major families of membrane proteins, a small beta-barrel protein, OmpA, and a model alpha-helical protein, glycophorin A. Despite differences in protein architecture, we highlight common mechanistic pathways in micelle formation, which are consistent with experimental studies. We characterize the exponential kinetics of detergent-protein adsorption and suggest a simple model which may explain the aggregation process. We also compare the results with 25 and 50 ns simulations of preformed micelles containing the same proteins. We confirm that the end structures of the self-assembled micelles are similar to those from their preformed counterparts, with each micelle presenting a bilayerlike environment to the enclosed protein.},

abstract = {The selectivity filter of the bacterial porin OmpF carries a small net charge close to -1 e and is therefore only slightly cation-selective. Calcium channels, on the other hand, contain four negatively charged glutamates, the EEEE-locus, and are among the most selective cation channels known. We aimed to turn the essentially nonselective OmpF into a Ca2+-selective channel. To that end, two additional glutamates (R42E and R132E) were introduced in the OmpF constriction zone that already contains D113 and E117. Mutant OmpF containing this DEEE-locus has a high Ca2+ over Cl- selectivity and a Na+ current with a strongly increased sensitivity to 1 mM Ca2+. The charge/space competition model, initially applied to the L-type Ca2+ channel, identifies the fixed charge and filter volume as key determinants of ion selectivity, with the precise atomic arrangement having only second-order effects. By implication, the reproduction of fixed charge and filter volume should transform two channels into channels of similar selectivity, even if the two belong to entirely different ion channel families, as is the case for OmpF and the L-type Ca2+ channel. The results presented here fit quite well in the framework of charge/space competition theory.},

@article{Watanabe1997a,
abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations were used to study the structure and dynamics of the Escherichia coli OmpF porin, which is composed of three identical 16-stranded beta-barrels. Simulations of the full trimer in the absence of water and the membrane led to significant contraction of the channel in the interior of each beta-barrel. With very weak harmonic constraints (0.005 kcal/mol A2/atom) applied to the main-chain C alpha atoms of the beta-barrel, the structure was stabilized without alteration of the average fluctuations. The resulting distribution of the fluctuations (small for beta-strands, large for loops and turns) is in good agreement with the x-ray B factors. Dynamic cross-correlation functions showed the importance of coupling between the loop motions and barrel flexibility. This was confirmed by the application of constraints corresponding to the observed temperature factors to the barrel C alpha atoms. With these constraints, the beta-barrel fluctuations were much smaller than the experimental values because of the intrinsic restrictions on the atomic motions, and the loop motions were reduced significantly. This result indicates that considerable care is required in introducing constraints to keep proteins close to the experimental structure during simulations, as has been done in several recent studies. Loop 3, which is thought to be important in gating the pore, undergoes a displacement that shifts it away from the x-ray structure. Analysis shows that this arises from the breakdown of a hydrogen bond network, which appears to result more from the absence of solvent that from the use of standard ionization states for the side chains of certain beta-barrel residues.},

Single channel reconstitution into black lipid membrane allowed single chitosugar binding events in the channel to be resolved. VhChiP has an exceptionally high substrate affinity, with a binding constant of K = 5.0 × 10(6) M(-1) for its best substrate (chitohexaose). The on-rates of chitosugars depend on applied voltages, as well as the side of the sugar addition, clearly indicating the inherent asymmetry of the VhChiP lumen. The binding affinity of VhChiP for chitohexaose is 1-5 orders of magnitude larger than that of other known sugar-specific porins for their preferred substrates. Thus, VhChiP is the most potent sugar-specific channel reported to date, with its high efficiency presumably reflecting the need for the bacterium to take up chitin-containing nutrients promptly under turbulent aquatic conditions to exploit them efficiently as its sole source of energy.},

In this work, by using density functional theory (DFT), we compute the electrostatic potential arising from the weak ionic and covalent bonding of B-N. Quantum partial charges of B and N atoms, determined by matching the electrostatic potential computed by the DFT, are then included in molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structure and dynamics of water confined in BNNTs of sizes ranging from (5,5) to (10,10). When partial charges are included, we observe that the wetting behavior of the (5,5) BNNT has improved and the single-file water chain in both (5,5) and (6,6) BNNTs has an L-defect. Further, with partial charges, except for a (9,9) BNNT which exhibits anomalous behavior, the diffusion coefficient of confined water molecules in (5,5), (6,6), and (10,10) BNNTs is found to decrease due to the formation of a hydrogen bond between water and nitrogen atoms. For a (9,9) BNNT, in the absence of partial charges, an ice-shell structure was observed with a critical slowing in the diffusion coefficient. When partial charges are included, the diffusion coefficient is found to increase because of the presence of an additional single-file water chain inside the ice-shell structure.},

abstract = {In the current report, we provide a quantitative analysis of the convergence of the sampling of conformational space accomplished in molecular dynamics simulations of membrane proteins of duration in the order of 10 nanoseconds. A set of proteins of diverse size and topology is considered, ranging from helical pores such as gramicidin and small beta-barrels such as OmpT, to larger and more complex structures such as rhodopsin and FepA. Principal component analysis of the C(alpha)-atom trajectories was employed to assess the convergence of the conformational sampling in both the transmembrane domains and the whole proteins, while the time-dependence of the average structure was analyzed to obtain single-domain information. The membrane-embedded regions, particularly those of small or structurally simple proteins, were found to achieve reasonable convergence. By contrast, extra-membranous domains lacking secondary structure are often markedly under-sampled, exhibiting a continuous structural drift. This drift results in a significant imprecision in the calculated B-factors, which detracts from any quantitative comparison to experimental data. In view of such limitations, we suggest that similar analyses may be valuable in simulation studies of membrane protein dynamics, in order to attach a level of confidence to any biologically relevant observations.},

abstract = {Single- and multiple-nanopore membranes are both highly interesting for biosensing and separation processes, as well as their ability to mimic biological membranes. The density of pores, their shape, and their surface chemistry are the key factors that determine membrane transport and separation capabilities. Here, we report silicon nitride (SiN) membranes with fully controlled porosity, pore geometry, and pore surface chemistry. An ultrathin freestanding SiN platform is described with conical or double-conical nanopores of diameters as small as several nanometers, prepared by the track-etching technique. This technique allows the membrane porosity to be tuned from one to billions of pores per square centimeter. We demonstrate the separation capabilities of these membranes by discrimination of dye and protein molecules based on their charge and size. This separation process is based on an electrostatic mechanism and operates in physiological electrolyte conditions. As we have also shown, the separation capabilities can be tuned by chemically modifying the pore walls. Compared with typical membranes with cylindrical pores, the conical and double-conical pores reported here allow for higher fluxes, a critical advantage in separation applications. In addition, the conical pore shape results in a shorter effective length, which gives advantages for single biomolecule detection applications such as nanopore-based DNA analysis.},

abstract = {All-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been applied in the recent past to explore the free energetics underlying ion transport processes in biological ion channels. Roux and co-workers, Kuyucak and co-workers, Busath and co-workers, and others have performed rather elegant and extended time scale molecular dynamics simulations using current state-of-the-art fixed-charge (nonpolarizable) force fields to calculate the potential of mean force defining the equilibrium flux of ions through prototypical channels such as gramicidin A. An inescapable conclusion of such studies has been the gross overestimation of the equilibrium free energy barrier, generally predicted to be from 10 to 20 kcal/mol depending on the force field and simulation protocol used in the calculation; this translates to an underestimation of experimentally measurable single channel conductances by several orders of magnitude. Next-generation polarizable force fields have been suggested as possible alternatives for more quantitative predictions of the underlying free energy surface in such systems. (1) Presently, we consider ion permeation energetics in the gramicidin A channel using a novel polarizable force field. Our results predict a peak barrier height of 6 kcal/mol relative to the channel entrance; this is significantly lower than the uncorrected value of 12 kcal/mol for nonpolarizable force fields such as GROMOS and CHARMM27 which do not account for electronic polarization. These results provide promising initial indications substantiating the long-conjectured importance of polarization effects in describing ion-protein interactions in narrow biological channels.},

abstract = {Membrane binding of the HIV-1 group-specific antigen (Gag) structural protein, a critical step in viral assembly at the plasma membrane, is mediated by the myristoylated, highly basic matrix (MA) domain, which interacts with negatively charged lipids in the inner leaflet. According to a popular model, virus particles bud from membrane rafts, microdomains enriched in cholesterol and high-melting phospholipids with higher order than found outside rafts. How Gag might recognize membrane rafts, if they exist in the inner leaflet, is unknown. Using a liposome flotation assay with proteins translated in vitro, we investigated whether Gag can sense the composition of the hydrophobic part of the bilayer, by fixing lipid head group composition and varying hydrophobic properties. In liposomes composed solely of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine, and with the same overall membrane negative charge, Gag strongly preferred lipids with both acyl chains unsaturated over those with only one chain unsaturated. Adding cholesterol increased Gag binding and led to closer packing of phospholipids. However, higher membrane order, as measured by electron spin resonance, was not correlated with increased Gag binding. Gag proteins from two other retroviruses gave similar results. These liposome binding preferences were qualitatively recapitulated by purified myristoylated HIV-1 MA. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and cholesterol enhanced binding in an additive manner. Taken together, these results show that Gag is sensitive both to the acyl chains of phosphatidylserine and to cholesterol concentration and other details of the membrane environment. These observations may help explain how retroviruses acquire a raft-like lipid composition.},

We performed normal mode analysis on the complete three-dimensional model to explore protein flexibility. Among the first 10 lowest frequency modes, only the first mode produces a structural reorganization compatible with channel gating: a wide opening of the channel pore caused by a concerted symmetrical quaternary twist motion of the protein with opposing rotations of the upper (extracellular) and lower (transmembrane) domains. Still, significant reorganizations are observed within each subunit, that involve their bending at the domain interface, an increase of angle between the two beta-sheets composing the extracellular domain, the internal beta-sheet being significantly correlated to the movement of the M2 alpha-helical segment. This global symmetrical twist motion of the pentameric protein complex, which resembles the opening transition of other multimeric ion channels, reasonably accounts for the available experimental data and thus likely describes the nAChR gating process.},

Solid-state nanopores currently suffer from the drawback, however, that the channel constituting the pore is long, approximately 100 times the distance between two bases in a DNA molecule (0.5 nm for single-stranded DNA). This paper provides proof of concept that it is possible to realize and use ultrathin nanopores fabricated in graphene monolayers for single-molecule DNA translocation. The pores are obtained by placing a graphene flake over a microsize hole in a silicon nitride membrane and drilling a nanosize hole in the graphene using an electron beam. As individual DNA molecules translocate through the pore, characteristic temporary conductance changes are observed in the ionic current through the nanopore, setting the stage for future single-molecule genomic screening devices.},

abstract = {N-acetylneuraminic acid-inducible channel (NanC) is an outer membrane channel of Escherichia coli . This porin folds as a 12-stranded $\beta$-barrel leading to a tubular shape. Electrophysiological experiments have revealed an asymmetric conductance with respect to the direction of the applied voltage and a weak anion selectivity of the channel. To this end, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to decipher the ion transport properties of the NanC channel. Concentration-dependent applied-field MD simulations recover the asymmetric conductance property and the anion selectivity of the channel in agreement with experiments. Further molecular analysis revealed the role of the asymmetric charge distribution inside the channel as the basis of the asymmetry in conductance. In addition, the particular distribution of charged residues at the inner channel walls leads to a faster permeation of Cl(-) ions compared to K(+) ions resulting in the anion selectivity of NanC. These findings are well supported by position-dependent diffusion coefficients and potential of mean force profiles derived from unbiased MD simulations. Taking one step further, we were able to engineer the NanC channel in silico by mutations leading to enhanced asymmetric conductances and anion selectivities. The E186Q mutant, for example, changes NanC into a decent molecular diode with an ionic current ratio of about 3:1 for opposite bias voltages.},

abstract = {Normal mode analysis (NMA) is a powerful tool for predicting the possible movements of a given macromolecule. It has been shown recently that half of the known protein movements can be modelled by using at most two low-frequency normal modes. Applications of NMA cover wide areas of structural biology, such as the study of protein conformational changes upon ligand binding, membrane channel opening and closure, potential movements of the ribosome, and viral capsid maturation. Another, newly emerging field of NMA is related to protein structure determination by X-ray crystallography, where normal mode perturbed models are used as templates for diffraction data phasing through molecular replacement (MR). Here we present ElN\'{e}mo, a web interface to the Elastic Network Model that provides a fast and simple tool to compute, visualize and analyse low-frequency normal modes of large macro-molecules and to generate a large number of different starting models for use in MR. Due to the ‘rotation-translation-block’ (RTB) approximation implemented in ElN\'{e}mo, there is virtually no upper limit to the size of the proteins that can be treated. Upon input of a protein structure in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format, ElN\'{e}mo computes its 100 lowest-frequency modes and produces a comprehensive set of descriptive parameters and visualizations, such as the degree of collectivity of movement, residue mean square displacements, distance fluctuation maps, and the correlation between observed and normal-mode-derived atomic displacement parameters (B-factors). Any number of normal mode perturbed models for MR can be generated for download. If two conformations of the same (or a homologous) protein are available, ElN\'{e}mo identifies the normal modes that contribute most to the corresponding protein movement.

Four MD simulations of 16 ns were performed at physiological and hyperpolarized membrane potentials, with and without restraints of the structure, but all without bound agonist. With the structure unrestrained and a potential of -100 mV, one cation traversed the channel during a transient period of channel hydration; at -200 mV, the channel was continuously hydrated and two cations traversed the channel. With the structure restrained, however, cations did not traverse the channel at either membrane potential, even though the channel was continuously hydrated. The overall results show that cation selective transport through the nAChR channel is governed by electrostatic interactions to achieve charge selectivity, but ion translocation relies on channel hydration, facilitated by a trans-membrane field, coupled with dynamic fluctuations of the channel structure.},

This is due to a structural transition from bulklike to “nanodroplet” water domains.

abstract = {How do proteins fold, and why do they fold in that way? This Perspective integrates earlier and more recent advances over the 50-y history of the protein folding problem, emphasizing unambiguously clear structural information. Experimental results show that, contrary to prior belief, proteins are multistate rather than two-state objects. They are composed of separately cooperative foldon building blocks that can be seen to repeatedly unfold and refold as units even under native conditions. Similarly, foldons are lost as units when proteins are destabilized to produce partially unfolded equilibrium molten globules. In kinetic folding, the inherently cooperative nature of foldons predisposes the thermally driven amino acid-level search to form an initial foldon and subsequent foldons in later assisted searches. The small size of foldon units, ∼20 residues, resolves the Levinthal time-scale search problem. These microscopic-level search processes can be identified with the disordered multitrack search envisioned in the "new view" model for protein folding. Emergent macroscopic foldon-foldon interactions then collectively provide the structural guidance and free energy bias for the ordered addition of foldons in a stepwise pathway that sequentially builds the native protein. These conclusions reconcile the seemingly opposed new view and defined pathway models; the two models account for different stages of the protein folding process. Additionally, these observations answer the "how" and the "why" questions. The protein folding pathway depends on the same foldon units and foldon-foldon interactions that construct the native structure.},

abstract = {In this Account, we describe the development of several diverse families of synthetic, membrane-active amphiphiles that form pores and facilitate transport within membrane bilayers. For the most part, the compounds are amphiphiles that insert into the bilayer and form pores either on their own or by self-assembly. The first family of synthetic ion channels prepared in our lab, the hydraphiles, used crown ethers as head groups and as a polar central element. In a range of biophysical studies, we showed that the hydraphiles formed unimolecular pores that spanned the bilayer. They mediated the transport of Na(+) and K(+) but were blocked by Ag(+). The hydraphiles are nonrectifying and disrupt ion homeostasis. As a result, these synthetic ion channels are toxic to various bacteria and yeast, a feature that has been used therapeutically in direct injection chemotherapy. We also developed a family of amphiphilic heptapeptide ion transporters that selected Cl(-) >10-fold over K(+) and showed voltage dependent gating. The formed pores were approximately dimeric, and variations in the N- and C-terminal anchor chains and the acids affected transport rates. Surprisingly, the longer N-terminal anchor chains led to less transport but greater Cl(-) selectivity. A proline residue, which is present in the ClC protein channel's conductance pore, proved to be critical for Cl(-) transport selectivity. Pyrogallol[4]arenes are macrocycles formed by acid-catalyzed condensation of four 1,2,3- trihydroxybenzenes with four aldehydes. The combination of 12 hydroxyl groups on one face of the macrocycle and four pendant alkyl chains conferred considerable amphiphilicity to these compounds. The pyrogallol[4]arenes inserted into bilayer membranes and conducted ions. Based on our experimental evidence, the ions passed through a self-assembled pore comprising four or five amphiphiles rather than passing through the central opening of a single macrocycle. Pyrogallol[4]arenes constructed with branched chains are also amphiphilic and active in membranes. The pyrogallol[4]arene with 3-pentyl sidechains formed a unique nanotube assembly and functioned as an ion channel in bilayer membranes. Finally, we showed that dianilides of either isophthalic or dipicolinic acids, compounds which have been extensively studied as anion binders, can self-assemble to form pores within bilayers. We called these dianilides tris-arenes and have shown that they readily bind to phosphate anions. These structures also mediated the transport of DNA plasmids through vital bilayer membranes in the bacterium Escherichia coli and in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . This transformation or transfection process occurred readily and without any apparent toxicity or mutagenicity.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) simulations have become an essential tool to study a large variety of biomolecular processes, exploring temporal and spatial scales inaccessible to traditional models of atomistic resolution. One of the major simplifications of CG models is the representation of the solvent, which is either implicit or modeled explicitly as a van der Waals particle. The effect of polarization, and thus a proper screening of interactions depending on the local environment, is absent. Given the important role of water as a ubiquitous solvent in biological systems, its treatment is crucial to the properties derived from simulation studies. Here, we parameterize a polarizable coarse-grained water model to be used in combination with the CG MARTINI force field. Using a three-bead model to represent four water molecules, we show that the orientational polarizability of real water can be effectively accounted for. This has the consequence that the dielectric screening of bulk water is reproduced. At the same time, we parameterized our new water model such that bulk water density and oil/water partitioning data remain at the same level of accuracy as for the standard MARTINI force field. We apply the new model to two cases for which current CG force fields are inadequate. First, we address the transport of ions across a lipid membrane. The computed potential of mean force shows that the ions now naturally feel the change in dielectric medium when moving from the high dielectric aqueous phase toward the low dielectric membrane interior. In the second application we consider the electroporation process of both an oil slab and a lipid bilayer. The electrostatic field drives the formation of water filled pores in both cases, following a similar mechanism as seen with atomistically detailed models.},

Furthermore, at position 251, hydrophilic or even negatively charged residues are compatible with an anionic channel.

abstract = {The Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) model is based on a mean-field approximation of ion interactions and continuum descriptions of concentration and electrostatic potential. It provides qualitative explanation and increasingly quantitative predictions of experimental measurements for the ion transport problems in many areas such as semiconductor devices, nanofluidic systems, and biological systems, despite many limitations. While the PNP model gives a good prediction of the ion transport phenomenon for chemical, physical, and biological systems, the number of equations to be solved and the number of diffusion coefficient profiles to be determined for the calculation directly depend on the number of ion species in the system, since each ion species corresponds to one Nernst-Planck equation and one position-dependent diffusion coefficient profile. In a complex system with multiple ion species, the PNP can be computationally expensive and parameter demanding, as experimental measurements of diffusion coefficient profiles are generally quite limited for most confined regions such as ion channels, nanostructures and nanopores. We propose an alternative model to reduce number of Nernst-Planck equations to be solved in complex chemical and biological systems with multiple ion species by substituting Nernst-Planck equations with Boltzmann distributions of ion concentrations. As such, we solve the coupled Poisson-Boltzmann and Nernst-Planck (PBNP) equations, instead of the PNP equations. The proposed PBNP equations are derived from a total energy functional by using the variational principle. We design a number of computational techniques, including the Dirichlet to Neumann mapping, the matched interface and boundary, and relaxation based iterative procedure, to ensure efficient solution of the proposed PBNP equations. Two protein molecules, cytochrome c551 and Gramicidin A, are employed to validate the proposed model under a wide range of bulk ion concentrations and external voltages. Extensive numerical experiments show that there is an excellent consistency between the results predicted from the present PBNP model and those obtained from the PNP model in terms of the electrostatic potentials, ion concentration profiles, and current-voltage (I-V) curves. The present PBNP model is further validated by a comparison with experimental measurements of I-V curves under various ion bulk concentrations. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed PBNP model is more efficient than the original PNP model in terms of simulation time.},

One phosphoporin trimer contains three pores which are induced simultaneously but fluctuate separately between open and closed states. Membrane potential shifts this two-state equilibrium in favour of closed channels. This negative resistance occurs at lower potentials than with matrix porin channels. The phosphoporin channel is poorly anion selective for small solutes. Polyphosphates and other phosphorylated molecules specifically inhibit phosphoporin pore conductance to small ions, a property which is specific to phosphoporin. There is an excellent correlation between the effect of such solutes measured in planar bilayers and their inhibitory effect on beta-lactam antibiotic uptake in vivo by phosphoporin. It is concluded that the phosphoporin channel contains a selectivity filter which is only efficient for larger molecules, most probably through basic residues.},

abstract = {The DSSP program automatically assigns the secondary structure for each residue from the three-dimensional co-ordinates of a protein structure to one of eight states. However, discrete assignments are incomplete in that they cannot capture the continuum of thermal fluctuations. Therefore, DSSPcont (http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/services/DSSPcont) introduces a continuous assignment of secondary structure that replaces 'static' by 'dynamic' states. Technically, the continuum results from calculating weighted averages over 10 discrete DSSP assignments with different hydrogen bond thresholds. A DSSPcont assignment for a particular residue is a percentage likelihood of eight secondary structure states, derived from a weighted average of the ten DSSP assignments. The continuous assignments have two important features: (i) they reflect the structural variations due to thermal fluctuations as detected by NMR spectroscopy; and (ii) they reproduce the structural variation between many NMR models from one single model. Therefore, functionally important variation can be extracted from a single X-ray structure using the continuous assignment procedure.},

abstract = {Confinement of matter on the nanometre scale can induce phase transitions not seen in bulk systems. In the case of water, so-called drying transitions occur on this scale as a result of strong hydrogen-bonding between water molecules, which can cause the liquid to recede from nonpolar surfaces to form a vapour layer separating the bulk phase from the surface. Here we report molecular dynamics simulations showing spontaneous and continuous filling of a nonpolar carbon nanotube with a one-dimensionally ordered chain of water molecules. Although the molecules forming the chain are in chemical and thermal equilibrium with the surrounding bath, we observe pulse-like transmission of water through the nanotube. These transmission bursts result from the tight hydrogen-bonding network inside the tube, which ensures that density fluctuations in the surrounding bath lead to concerted and rapid motion along the tube axis. We also find that a minute reduction in the attraction between the tube wall and water dramatically affects pore hydration, leading to sharp, two-state transitions between empty and filled states on a nanosecond timescale. These observations suggest that carbon nanotubes, with their rigid nonpolar structures, might be exploited as unique molecular channels for water and protons, with the channel occupancy and conductivity tunable by changes in the local channel polarity and solvent conditions.},

abstract = {Biological ion channels are nanoscale transmembrane pores. When water and ions are enclosed within the narrow confines of a sub-nanometer hydrophobic pore, they exhibit behavior not evident from macroscopic descriptions. At this nanoscopic level, the unfavorable interaction between the lining of a hydrophobic pore and water may lead to stochastic liquid-vapor transitions. These transient vapor states are "dewetted", i.e. effectively devoid of water molecules within all or part of the pore, thus leading to an energetic barrier to ion conduction. This process, termed "hydrophobic gating", was first observed in molecular dynamics simulations of model nanopores, where the principles underlying hydrophobic gating (i.e., changes in diameter, polarity, or transmembrane voltage) have now been extensively validated. Computational, structural, and functional studies now indicate that biological ion channels may also exploit hydrophobic gating to regulate ion flow within their pores. Here we review the evidence for this process and propose that this unusual behavior of water represents an increasingly important element in understanding the relationship between ion channel structure and function. © 2014.},

Neutralization of the negatively charged ring at the intracellular end of the channel (E-1'A) results in a nonselective channel (PNa/PCl=0.89). 3. Insertion of positively charged residues at the extracellular end of the pore either results in a nonfunctional receptor (A24'K) or one that remains cation-selective (PNa/PCl=110; S19'R). 4. Combining the removal of a negatively charged ring (E-1'A) with the insertion of a positively charged ring (S19'R), however, results in a channel that is predominantly anion-selective (PNa/PCl=0.37). 5. The data suggest that for the cation-selective 5-HT3 receptor, the control of selectivity exerted by charged rings at either end of the pore is dominated by the ring of negatively charged residues at the intracellular side of the channel. As changing the charge at this position has also been shown to change ionic selectivity in anion-selective receptors, these data suggest that electrostatic factors can control selectivity in the whole Cys-loop family.},

This superfamily of allosteric transmembrane proteins includes the nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChR), serotonin 5-HT3, gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABAA and GABAC) and glycine receptors. Biochemical and electrophysiological information on the prototypic nAChRs is abundant but structural data at atomic resolution have been missing. Here we present the crystal structure of molluscan acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP), a structural and functional homologue of the amino-terminal ligand-binding domain of an nAChR alpha-subunit. In the AChBP homopentamer, the protomers have an immunoglobulin-like topology. Ligand-binding sites are located at each of five subunit interfaces and contain residues contributed by biochemically determined 'loops' A to F. The subunit interfaces are highly variable within the ion-channel family, whereas the conserved residues stabilize the protomer fold. This AChBP structure is relevant for the development of drugs against, for example, Alzheimer's disease and nicotine addiction.},

Challenges include control of nanopore diameters and surface chemistry, modification of the translocation times of single-molecule analytes through nanopores, and prevention of non-specific interactions with pore walls. Here, inspired by the olfactory sensilla of insect antennae, we show that coating nanopores with a fluid lipid bilayer tailors their surface chemistry and allows fine-tuning and dynamic variation of pore diameters in subnanometre increments. Incorporation of mobile ligands in the lipid bilayer conferred specificity and slowed the translocation of targeted proteins sufficiently to time-resolve translocation events of individual proteins. Lipid coatings also prevented pores from clogging, eliminated non-specific binding and enabled the translocation of amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) oligomers and fibrils. Through combined analysis of their translocation time, volume, charge, shape and ligand affinity, different proteins were identified.},

Soc.2011, 133, 141-147) to stack on top of one another in lipid membranes to form nanopores. Pore formation was driven by a strong tendency of the water molecules in the interior of the amphiphilic macrocycles to aggregate in a nonpolar environment. In this work, cholate oligomers terminated with guanidinium and carboxylate groups were found to cause efflux of hydrophilic molecules such as glucose, maltotriose, and carboxyfluorescein (CF) from POPC/POPG liposomes. The cholate trimer outperformed other oligomers in the transport. Lipid-mixing assays and dynamic light scattering ruled out fusion as the cause of leakage. The strong dependence on chain length argues against random intermolecular aggregates as the active transporters. The efflux of glucose triggered by these compounds increased significantly when the bilayers contained 30 mol% cholesterol. Hill analysis suggested that the active transporter consisted of four molecules. The oligocholates were proposed to fold into "noncovalent macrocycles" by the guanidinium-carboxylate salt bridge and stack on top of one another to form similar transmembrane pores as their covalent counterparts.},

Previous studies have shown that neither the periplasmic turns nor the surface-exposed loops contain topogenic information. Consequently, the question of whether any structural constraint is imposed onto individual transmembrane beta-strands is now addressed. To this end, amino acid sequences of beta-strands 4, 6 and 8 were randomized. In vivo membrane assembly of mutant proteins was assayed and 288 variants were sequenced. Three parameters were found to be important for efficient membrane assembly. (i) At least four of five randomized residues with side-chains pointing towards the lipid bilayer must be hydrophobic and none of the three central residues must be charged. (ii) Side-chains pointing into the beta-barrel interior must not be enlarged too much, possibly because of packing constraints. (iii) Proline residues are, in general, hardly tolerated in the transmembrane beta-strands.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are applied to study the spreading behavior of a nanosized water droplet that contains freely moving Na(+)/Cl(-) ions subject to an imposed electric field parallel to a solid surface. Results show that the positive and negative ions move relatively freely in response to an applied electric field, whereas polar water molecules realign themselves. These localized behaviors of the ions and the polar molecules are affected by both the applied electric field strength and the ion concentration, which in turn determine the deformation and spreading of the droplet on a solid substrate. The presence of the freely moving ions causes the ion-containing droplet to spread differently from a droplet of pure water. In a weak electric field of 0.05 V/\AA, a droplet of a lower ion concentration spreads asymmetrically and the spreading asymmetry is considerably smaller than that associated with a pure water droplet of the same size. In a stronger field of 0.1 V/\AA, a droplet of a higher ion concentration spreads symmetrically and completely wets the solid surface whereas a less ionically conducting droplet undergoes an asymmetric-to-symmetric transition in spreading until it reaches equilibrium.},

abstract = {A detailed picture of water and ion properties in small pores is important for understanding the behavior of biological ion channels. Several recent modeling studies have shown that small, hydrophobic pores exclude water and ions even if they are physically large enough to accommodate them, a mechanism called hydrophobic gating. This mechanism has been implicated in the gating of several channels, including the mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS). Although the pore in the crystal structure of MscS is wide and was initially hypothesized to be open, it is lined by hydrophobic residues and may represent a nonconducting state. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on MscS to determine whether or not the structure can conduct ions. Unlike previous simulations of hydrophobic nanopores, electric fields were applied to this system to model the transmembrane potential, which proved to be important. Although simulations without a potential resulted in a dehydrated, occluded pore, the application of a potential increased the hydration of the pore and resulted in current flow through the channel. The calculated channel conductance was in good agreement with experiment. Therefore, it is likely that the MscS crystal structure is closer to a conducting than a nonconducting state.},

Bacterial mechanosensitive channels MscL and MscS are the best-studied tension-gated nanopores, yet the key physical factors that define their gating are still hotly debated. Here we present estimations, simulations and experimental results showing that hydration of the pore might be one of the major parameters defining the thermodynamics and kinetics of mechanosensitive channel gating. We associate closing of channel pores with complete dehydration of the hydrophobic gate (occlusion by 'vapor lock') and formation of two water-vapor interfaces above and below the constriction. The opening path is the expansion of these interfaces, ultimately leading to wetting of the hydrophobic pore, which does not appear to be the exact reverse of the closing path, thus producing hysteresis. We discuss specifically the role of polar groups (glycines) buried in narrow closed conformations but exposed in the open states that change the wetting characteristics of the pore lining and stabilize conductive states of the channels.},

abstract = {Learning from nature has inspired the fabrication of novel artificial materials that enable researchers to understand and to imitate biology. Bio-inspired research, in particular, owes much of its current development to advances in materials science and creative "smart" system design. The development and application of bio-inspired nanochannels is a burgeoning area in this field of research. Bio-inspired nanochannels enable many potential approaches to study various biomolecules in confined spaces and in real-time by current measurements. In this Perspective, we describe how these bio-inspired systems can be used to build novel, smart nanodevices with precisely controlled functions. Applications for these systems range from simulating the process of ion transport in living organisms by using biomimetic nanochannels to applying artificial nanochannel systems to investigate the chemistry, structure, size, and conformational states of biomolecules.},

abstract = {Monolayer graphene is one of the most interesting materials applicable to next-generation electronic devices due to its transport properties. However, realization of graphene devices requires suitable nanoscale lithography as well as a method to open a band gap in monolayer graphene. Nanoscale hydrogenation and oxidation are promising methods to open an energy band gap by modification of surface structures and to fabricate nanostructures such as graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). Until now it has been difficult to fabricate nanoscale devices consisting of both hydrogenated and oxidized graphene because the hydrogenation of graphene requires a complicated process composed of large-scale chemical modification, nanoscale patterning, and etching. We report on nanoscale hydrogenation and oxidation of graphene under normal atmospheric conditions and at room temperature without etching, wet process, or even any gas treatment by controlling just an external bias through atomic force microscope lithography. Both the lithographically defined nanoscale hydrogenation and oxidation have been confirmed by micro-Raman spectroscopy measurements. Patterned hydrogenated and oxidized graphene show insulating behaviors, and their friction values are several times larger than those of graphene. These differences can be used for fabricating electronic or electromechanical devices based on graphene.},

abstract = {Ligand-gated ion channel receptors mediate neuronal inhibition or excitation depending on their ion charge selectivity. An investigation into the determinants of ion charge selectivity of the anion-selective alpha1 homomeric glycine receptor (alpha1 glycine receptor [GlyR]) was undertaken using point mutations to residues lining the extra- and intracellular ends of the ion channel. Five mutant GlyRs were studied. A single substitution at the intracellular mouth of the channel (A-1'E GlyR) was sufficient to convert the channels to select cations over anions with P(Cl)/P(Na) = 0.34. This result delimits the selectivity filter and provides evidence that electrostatic interactions between permeating ions and pore residues are a critical factor in ion charge selectivity. The P-2'Delta mutant GlyR retained its anion selectivity (P(Cl)/P(Na) = 3.81), but it was much reduced compared with the wild-type (WT) GlyR (P(Cl)/P(Na) = 27.9). When the A-1'E and the P-2'Delta mutations were combined (selectivity double mutant [SDM] GlyR), the relative cation permeability was enhanced (P(Cl)/P(Na) = 0.13). The SDM GlyR was also Ca(2+) permeable (P(Ca)/P(Na) = 0.29). Neutralizing the extracellular mouth of the SDM GlyR ion channel (SDM+R19'A GlyR) produced a more Ca(2+)-permeable channel (P(Ca)/P(Na) = 0.73), without drastically altering monovalent charge selectivity (P(Cl)/P(Na) = 0.23). The SDM+R19'E GlyR, which introduces a negatively charged ring at the extracellular mouth of the channel, further enhanced Ca(2+) permeability (P(Ca)/P(Na) = 0.92), with little effect on monovalent selectivity (P(Cl)/P(Na) = 0.19). Estimates of the minimum pore diameter of the A-1'E, SDM, SDM+R19'A, and SDM+R19'E GlyRs revealed that these pores are larger than the alpha1 GlyR, with the SDM-based GlyRs being comparable in diameter to the cation-selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This result provides evidence that the diameter of the ion channel is also an important factor in ion charge selectivity.},

Mustards have also been used to treat cancer and played a vital role in the development of chemotherapy. Additionally, because of their destructive properties, ease of synthesis, and the lack of effective antidotes, mustards are unquestionably terrorist threats. Therefore, quick and convenient detection of mustards is a critical issue. In the present study, we achieved detection of various mustards on the basis of their chemical reactivity by using engineered alpha-hemolysin (alphaHL) protein pores as sensor elements. We describe four classes of reactions for detecting mustards. These reactions occur between mustards and thiol groups contributed by cysteine side-chains within the lumen of the alphaHL pore or on an internal molecular adapter. The approach is quick and straightforward. It can confirm the existence of mustards in as little as 10 min at 50 microM or lower.},

abstract = {In this study, we found that phospholipids containing an eicosapentaenyl group form a novel membrane microdomain at the cell division site of a Gram-negative bacterium, Shewanella livingstonensis Ac10, using chemically synthesized fluorescent probes. The occurrence of membrane microdomains in eukaryotes and prokaryotes has been demonstrated with various imaging tools for phospholipids with different polar headgroups. However, few studies have focused on the hydrocarbon chain-dependent localization of membrane-resident phospholipids in vivo. We previously found that lack of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid found at the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids, causes a defect in cell division after DNA replication of S. livingstonensis Ac10. Here, we synthesized phospholipid probes labeled with a fluorescent 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl (NBD) group to study the localization of EPA-containing phospholipids by fluorescence microscopy. A fluorescent probe in which EPA was bound to the glycerol backbone via an ester bond was found to be unsuitable for imaging because EPA was released from the probe by in vivo hydrolysis. To overcome this problem, we synthesized hydrolysis-resistant ether-type phospholipid probes. Using these probes, we found that the fluorescence localized between two nucleoids at the cell center during cell division when the cells were grown in the presence of the eicosapentaenyl group-containing probe (N-NBD-1-oleoyl-2-eicosapentaenyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine), whereas this localization was not observed with the oleyl group-containing control probe (N-NBD-1-oleoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine). Thus, phospholipids containing an eicosapentaenyl group are specifically enriched at the cell division site. Formation of a membrane microdomain enriched in EPA-containing phospholipids at the nucleoid occlusion site probably facilitates cell division.},

abstract = {Advances in modern computational methods and technology make it possible to carry out extensive molecular dynamics simulations of complex membrane proteins based on detailed atomic models. The ultimate goal of such detailed simulations is to produce trajectories in which the behavior of the system is as realistic as possible. A critical aspect that requires consideration in the case of biological membrane systems is the existence of a net electric potential difference across the membrane. For meaningful computations, it is important to have well validated methodologies for incorporating the latter in molecular dynamics simulations. A widely used treatment of the membrane potential in molecular dynamics consists of applying an external uniform electric field E perpendicular to the membrane. The field acts on all charged particles throughout the simulated system, and the resulting applied membrane potential V is equal to the applied electric field times the length of the periodic cell in the direction perpendicular to the membrane. A series of test simulations based on simple membrane-slab models are carried out to clarify the consequences of the applied field. These illustrative tests demonstrate that the constant-field method is a simple and valid approach for accounting for the membrane potential in molecular dynamics studies of biomolecular systems.

The three glucose units assume a conformation close to the natural amylose helix. The pore eyelet fits exactly the cross-section of a maltooligosaccharide chain and thus functions as a constraining orifice. The oligomer permeates the membrane by screwing along the amylose helix through this orifice. Because each glucose glides along the given helix, its interactions can be sampled at any point along the pathway. The interactions are mostly hydrogen bonds, but also contacts to aromatic rings at one side of the pore. We have derived the energy profile of a gliding maltooligosaccharide by following formation and breakage of hydrogen bonds and by assessing the saccharide-aromatics interactions from a statistical analysis of saccharide binding sites in proteins. The resulting profile indicates smooth permeation despite extensive hydrogen bonding at the orifice.},

We compare numerical solutions of the Poisson, Nernst-Planck (PNP), and Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with their one-dimensional, analytical approximations. We show that by decreasing the length of the nanopore, the ionic current and ionic selectivity become affected by processes outside the nanochannel. The contribution of electroosmosis is noticeable, especially for highly charged nanochannels, but is insignificant, justifying the use of the simple one-dimensional approximation in many cases. Estimates for the critical electric field at which the nanopore selectivity decreases and the ion current starts to saturate are provided.},

Water is represented by the extended simple point charge model and the carbon atoms as Lennard-Jones spheres. The nanotubes are decorated with different amounts of oxygenated sites, represented as carbonyl groups. In the absence of carbonyl groups the simulated isotherms are characterized by negligible amounts of water uptake at low pressures, sudden and complete pore filling once a threshold pressure is reached, and wide adsorption-desorption hysteresis loops. In the presence of a few carbonyl groups the simulated adsorption isotherms are characterized by pore filling at lower pressures and by narrower adsorption-desorption hysteresis loops compared to the results obtained in the absence of carbonyl groups. Our results show that the distribution of the carbonyl groups has a strong effect on the adsorption isotherms. For carbonyl groups localized in a narrow section the adsorption of water may be gradual because a cluster of adsorbed water forms at low pressures and grows as the pressure increases. For carbonyl groups distributed along the nanotube the adsorption isotherm is of type V.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to unmask details of specific interactions of anionic phospholipids with intersubunit binding sites on the surface of the bacterial potassium channel KcsA. Crystallographic data on a diacyl glycerol fragment at this site were used to model phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), or phosphatidylglycerol (PG), or phosphatidic acid (PA) at the intersubunit binding sites. Each of these models of a KcsA-lipid complex was embedded in phosphatidyl choline bilayer and explored in a 20 ns MD simulation. H-bond analysis revealed that in terms of lipid-protein interactions PA > PG > PE and revealed how anionic lipids (PG and PA) bind to a site provided by two key arginine residues (R(64) and R(89)) at the interface between adjacent subunits. A 27 ns simulation was performed in which KcsA (without any lipids initially modeled at the R(64)/R(89) sites) was embedded in a PE/PG bilayer. There was a progressive specific increase over the course of the simulation in the number of H-bonds of PG with KcsA. Furthermore, two specific PG binding events at R(64)/R(89) sites were observed. The phosphate oxygen atoms of bound PG formed H-bonds to the guanidinium group of R(89), whereas the terminal glycerol H-bonded to R(64). Overall, this study suggests that simulations can help identify and characterize sites for specific lipid interactions on a membrane protein surface.},

By means of molecular dynamics many aspects of membrane electroporation have been unveiled at the molecular detail in simple, homogeneous, lipid bilayers. However, the correspondence of these findings \with the process happening in cell membranes requires, at least, the consideration of laterally structured membranes. Here, I present a systematic molecular dynamics study of bilayers composed of different liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered lipid phases subjected to a transversal electric field. The simulations reveal two significant results. First, the electric field mainly affects the properties of the disordered phases, so that electroporation takes place in these membrane regions. Second, the smaller the disordered domains are, the faster they become electroporated. These findings may have a relevant significance in the experimental application of cell electroporation in vivo since it implies that electro-induced and pore-mediated transport processes occur in particularly small disordered domains of the plasma membrane, thus locally affecting only specific regions of the cell. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Autotransporters (ATs) are large virulence factors secreted by Gram-negative bacteria. The passenger domain, carrying the virulence functions, is transported across the bacterial outer membrane in a step that is facilitated by a C-terminal $\beta$-domain. This domain folds into a $\beta$-barrel with a central aqueous pore of ∼1 nm inner diameter according to crystal structures. However, these static dimensions are not compatible with the observed secretion of passengers that may contain natural short-spaced disulfide bonds or artificially fused folded elements. Here, we have systematically analyzed the dimensions of the active AT passenger translocator by inserting peptides of different length and structural complexity in the passenger of the AT hemoglobin protease. The peptides were introduced in a short loop protruding from the main structure and flanked by two single cysteines. Our results show that the attained secondary structure may be more critical for secretion than the length of peptide inserted. Furthermore, the data suggest that, during passenger translocation, at least four extended polypeptides or an extended polypeptide and an $\alpha$-helix are accommodated in the translocator, indicating that the diameter of the active translocation pore is up to 1.7 nm. If the $\beta$-domain functions as the translocator, it must be forced into an expanded conformation during passenger translocation.},

abstract = {A shortage of fresh water is one of the acute challenges facing the world today. An energy-efficient approach to converting sea water into fresh water could be of substantial benefit, but current desalination methods require high power consumption and operating costs or large-scale infrastructures, which make them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings or in disaster scenarios. Here, we report a process for converting sea water (salinity approximately 500 mM or approximately 30,000 mg l(-1)) to fresh water (salinity <10 mM or <600 mg l(-1)) in which a continuous stream of sea water is divided into desalted and concentrated streams by ion concentration polarization, a phenomenon that occurs when an ion current is passed through ion-selective membranes. During operation, both salts and larger particles (cells, viruses and microorganisms) are pushed away from the membrane (a nanochannel or nanoporous membrane), which significantly reduces the possibility of membrane fouling and salt accumulation, thus avoiding two problems that plague other membrane filtration methods. To implement this approach, a simple microfluidic device was fabricated and shown to be capable of continuous desalination of sea water (approximately 99% salt rejection at 50% recovery rate) at a power consumption of less than 3.5 Wh l(-1), which is comparable to current state-of-the-art systems. Rather than competing with larger desalination plants, the method could be used to make small- or medium-scale systems, with the possibility of battery-powered operation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nanosecond, megavolt-per-meter pulsed electric fields scramble membrane phospholipids, release intracellular calcium, and induce apoptosis. Flow cytometric and fluorescence microscopy evidence has associated phospholipid rearrangement directly with nanoelectropulse exposure and supports the hypothesis that the potential that develops across the lipid bilayer during an electric pulse drives phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization. RESULTS: In this work we extend observations of cells exposed to electric pulses with 30 ns and 7 ns durations to still narrower pulse widths, and we find that even 3 ns pulses are sufficient to produce responses similar to those reported previously. We show here that in contrast to unipolar pulses, which perturb membrane phospholipid order, tracked with FM1-43 fluorescence, only at the anode side of the cell, bipolar pulses redistribute phospholipids at both the anode and cathode poles, consistent with migration of the anionic PS head group in the transmembrane field. In addition, we demonstrate that, as predicted by the membrane charging hypothesis, a train of shorter pulses requires higher fields to produce phospholipid scrambling comparable to that produced by a time-equivalent train of longer pulses (for a given applied field, 30, 4 ns pulses produce a weaker response than 4, 30 ns pulses). Finally, we show that influx of YO-PRO-1, a fluorescent dye used to detect early apoptosis and activation of the purinergic P2X7 receptor channels, is observed after exposure of Jurkat T lymphoblasts to sufficiently large numbers of pulses, suggesting that membrane poration occurs even with nanosecond pulses when the electric field is high enough. Propidium iodide entry, a traditional indicator of electroporation, occurs with even higher pulse counts. CONCLUSION: Megavolt-per-meter electric pulses as short as 3 ns alter the structure of the plasma membrane and permeabilize the cell to small molecules. The dose responses of cells to unipolar and bipolar pulses ranging from 3 ns to 30 ns duration support the hypothesis that a field-driven charging of the membrane dielectric causes the formation of pores on a nanosecond time scale, and that the anionic phospholipid PS migrates electrophoretically along the wall of these pores to the external face of the membrane.},

abstract = {A new Lagrangian formulation is introduced. It can be used to make molecular dynamics (MD) calculations on systems under the most general, externally applied, conditions of stress. In this formulation the MD cell shape and size can change according to dynamical equations given by this Lagrangian. This new MD technique is well suited to the study of structural transformations in solids under external stress and at finite temperature. As an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the stress‐strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a bifurcation in its stress‐strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal close packing. It is suggested that such a transformation could perhaps be observed experimentally under extreme conditions of shock.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli transports Fe3+ as a ferrichrome complex through the outer membrane in an energy-dependent process mediated by the FhuA protein. A FhuA deletion derivative lacking residues 322 to 355 (FhuA delta322-355) forms a permanently open channel through which ferrichrome diffused. This finding led to the concept that the FhuA protein forms a closed channel that is opened by input of energy derived from the electrochemical potential across the cytoplasmic membrane, mediated by the Ton system. In this study, we constructed various FhuA derivatives containing deletions inside and outside the gating loop. FhuA delta322-336 bound ferrichrome and displayed a residual Ton-dependent ferrichrome transport activity. FhuA delta335-355 no longer bound ferrichrome but supported ferrichrome diffusion through the outer membrane in the absence of the Ton system. FhuA delta335-355 rendered cells sensitive to sodium dodecyl sulfate and supported diffusion of maltotetraose and maltopentaose in a lamB mutant lacking the maltodextrin-specific channel in the outer membrane. Cells expressing FhuA delta70-223, which has a large deletion outside the gating loop, were highly sensitive to sodium dodecyl sulfate and grew on maltodextrins but showed only weak ferrichrome uptake, suggesting formation of a nonspecific pore through the outer membrane. FhuA delta457-479 supported Ton-dependent uptake of ferrichrome. None of these FhuA deletion derivatives formed pores in black lipid membranes with a stable single-channel conductance. Rather, the conductance displayed a high degree of current noise, indicating a substantial influence of the deletions on the conformation of the FhuA protein. FhuA also supports infection by the phages T1, T5, and phi80 and renders cells sensitive to albomycin and colicin M. Cells expressing FhuA delta322-336 were sensitive to albomycin and colicin M but were only weakly sensitive to T5 and phi480 and insensitive to T1. Cells expressing FhuA delta335-355 were resistant to all FhuA ligands. These results indicate different structural requirements within the gating loop for the various FhuA ligands. Cells expressing FhuA delta457-479 displayed a strongly reduced sensitivity to all FhuA ligands, while cells expressing FhuA delta70-223 were rather sensitive to all FhuA ligands except albomycin, to which they were nearly resistant. It is concluded that residues 335 to 355 mainly determine the properties of the gate with regard to FhuA permeability and ligand binding.},

abstract = {Potassium ions diffuse across the cell membrane in a single file through the narrow selectivity filter of potassium channels. The crystal structure of the KcsA K+ channel revealed the chemical structure of the selectivity filter, which contains four binding sites for K+. In this study, we used Tl+ in place of K+ to address the question of how many ions bind within the filter at a given time, i.e. what is the absolute ion occupancy? By refining the Tl+ structure against data to 1.9?? resolution with an anomalous signal, we determined the absolute occupancy of Tl+. Then, by comparing the electron density of Tl+ with that of K+, Rb+ and Cs +, we estimated the absolute occupancy of these three ions. We further analyzed how the ion occupancy affects the conformation of the selectivity filter by analyzing the structure of KcsA at different concentrations of Tl+. Our results indicate that the average occupancy for each site in the selectivity filter is about 0.63 for Tl + and 0.53 for K+. For K+, Rb+ and Cs+, the total number of ions contained within four sites in the selectivity filter is about two. At low concentrations of permeant ion, the number of ions drops to one in association with a conformational change in the selectivity filter. We conclude that electrostatic balance and coupling of ion binding to a protein conformational change underlie high conduction rates in the setting of high selectivity. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Membranes incorporating carbon nanotubes are found to be promising candidates for water desalination using reverse osmosis, and the size and uniformity of tubes that is required to achieve a desired salt rejection is determined. By calculating the potential of mean force for ion and water translocation, we show that ions face a large energy barrier and will not pass through the narrower tubes studied ((5,5) and (6,6) "armchair" type tubes) but can pass through the wider (7,7) and (8,8) nanotubes. Water, however, faces no such impediment due to the formation of stable hydrogen bonds and crosses all of the tubes studied at very large rates. By measuring this conduction rate under a hydrostatic pressure difference, we show that membranes incorporating carbon nanotubes can, in principle, achieve a high degree of desalination at flow rates far in excess of existing membranes.},

In the 2.7 A structure of crystals grown at pH 5.6, the pore is blocked by loop 6, which folds across the channel. The rearrangement of loop 6 appears to be triggered by a pair of histidine residues, which repel one another at acidic pH, resulting in the breakage of neighbouring H-bonds and a lengthening of loop 6 from 10 to 17 residues. A total of 151 ordered LDAO detergent molecules were found in the 2.3 A structure, mostly on the hydrophobic outer surface of OmpG, mimicking the outer membrane lipid bilayer, with three LDAO molecules in the open pore. In the 2.7 A structure, OmpG binds one OG and one glucose molecule as sugar substrates in the closed pore.},

abstract = {Functionalization and dispersion of graphene sheets are of crucial importance for their end applications. Chemical functionalization of graphene enables this material to be processed by solvent-assisted techniques, such as layer-by-layer assembly, spin-coating, and filtration. It also prevents the agglomeration of single layer graphene during reduction and maintains the inherent properties of graphene. Therefore, a detailed review on the advances of chemical functionalization of graphene is presented. Synthesis and characterization of graphene have also been reviewed in the current article. The functionalization of graphene can be performed by covalent and noncovalent modification techniques. In both cases, surface modification of graphene oxide followed by reduction has been carried out to obtain functionalized graphene. It has been found that both the covalent and noncovalent modification techniques are very effective in the preparation of processable graphene. However, the electrical conductivity of the functionalized graphene has been observed to decrease significantly compared to pure graphene. Moreover, the surface area of the functionalized graphene prepared by covalent and non-covalent techniques decreases significantly due to the destructive chemical oxidation of flake graphite followed by sonication, functionalization and chemical reduction. In order to overcome these problems, several studies have been reported on the preparation of functionalized graphene directly from graphite (one-step process). In all these cases, surface modification of graphene can prevent agglomeration and facilitates the formation of stable dispersions. Surface modified graphene can be used for the fabrication of polymer nanocomposites, super-capacitor devices, drug delivery system, solar cells, memory devices, transistor device, biosensor, etc. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Nanopore technologies are being developed for fast and direct sequencing of single DNA molecules through detection of ionic current modulations as DNA passes through a pore's constriction. Here we demonstrate the ability to resolve changes in current that correspond to a known DNA sequence by combining the high sensitivity of a mutated form of the protein pore Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) with phi29 DNA polymerase (DNAP), which controls the rate of DNA translocation through the pore. As phi29 DNAP synthesizes DNA and functions like a motor to pull a single-stranded template through MspA, we observe well-resolved and reproducible ionic current levels with median durations of ∼28 ms and ionic current differences of up to 40 pA. Using six different DNA sequences with readable regions 42-53 nucleotides long, we record current traces that map to the known DNA sequences. With single-nucleotide resolution and DNA translocation control, this system integrates solutions to two long-standing hurdles to nanopore sequencing.},

abstract = {Phosphate is crucial for structural and metabolic needs, including nucleotide and lipid synthesis, signalling and chemical energy storage. Proton-coupled transporters of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) are essential for phosphate uptake in plants and fungi, and also have a function in sensing external phosphate levels as transceptors. Here we report the 2.9 \AA structure of a fungal (Piriformospora indica) high-affinity phosphate transporter, PiPT, in an inward-facing occluded state, with bound phosphate visible in the membrane-buried binding site. The structure indicates both proton and phosphate exit pathways and suggests a modified asymmetrical 'rocker-switch' mechanism of phosphate transport. PiPT is related to several human transporter families, most notably the organic cation and anion transporters of the solute carrier family (SLC22), which are implicated in cancer-drug resistance. We modelled representative cation and anion SLC22 transporters based on the PiPT structure to surmise the structural basis for substrate binding and charge selectivity in this important family. The PiPT structure demonstrates and expands on principles of substrate transport by the MFS transporters and illuminates principles of phosphate uptake in particular.},

abstract = {Recently discovered bacterial homologues of eukaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, such as the Gloeobacter violaceus receptor (GLIC), are increasingly used as structural and functional models of signal transduction in the nervous system. Here we present a one-microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulation of the GLIC channel pH stimulated gating mechanism. The crystal structure of GLIC obtained at acidic pH in an open-channel form is equilibrated in a membrane environment and then instantly set to neutral pH. The simulation shows a channel closure that rapidly takes place at the level of the hydrophobic furrow and a progressively increasing quaternary twist. Two major events are captured during the simulation. They are initiated by local but large fluctuations in the pore, taking place at the top of the M2 helix, followed by a global tertiary relaxation. The two-step transition of the first subunit starts within the first 50 ns of the simulation and is followed at 450 ns by its immediate neighbor in the pentamer, which proceeds with a similar scenario. This observation suggests a possible two-step domino-like tertiary mechanism that takes place between adjacent subunits. In addition, the dynamical properties of GLIC described here offer an interpretation of the paradoxical properties of a permeable A13'F mutant whose crystal structure determined at 3.15 A shows a pore too narrow to conduct ions.},

Here we observe a surprising fivefold enhancement of stochastic ion transport rates for single-walled carbon nanotube centered at a diameter of approximately 1.6 nm. An electrochemical transport model informed from literature simulations is used to understand the phenomenon. We also observe rates that scale with cation type as Li(+)>K(+)>Cs(+)>Na(+) and pore blocking extent as K(+)>Cs(+)>Na(+)>Li(+) potentially reflecting changes in hydration shell size. Across several ion types, the pore-blocking current and inverse dwell time are shown to scale linearly at low electric field.

OmpW thus presented an opportunity for a detailed comparison of the extracellular loops in a $\beta$-barrel membrane protein structure in crystals and in noncrystalline milieus. Here, the polypeptide backbone conformation of OmpW in 30-Fos micelles was determined. Complete backbone NMR assignments were obtained and the loops were structurally characterized. In combination with the OmpW crystal structure, NMR line shape analyses, and (15)N{(1)H}-NOE data, these results showed that intact regular secondary structures in the loops undergo slow hinge motions at the detergent-solvent interface.},

The computational results indicate that SWNTs can activate and guide the self-assembly of polymer chains, allowing them to adopt a helical configuration in a SWNT through the combined action of the van der Waals potential well and the $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking interaction between the polymer and the inner surface of SWNTs. Meanwhile both the SWNT size and polymer chain stiffness determine the outcome of the nanostructure. Furthermore, we also found that water clusters encourage the self-assembly of PA helical structures in the tube. This molecular model may lead to a better understanding of the formation of a double helix biological molecule inside SWNTs. Alternatively, it could form the basis of a novel nanoscale material by utilizing the 'empty' spaces of SWNTs.},

The two subunits NfpA and NfpB form a hetero-oligomeric cation selective channel. On the basis of amino acid comparison we performed homology modeling and obtained a channel structurally related to MspA of Mycobacterium smegmatis. The quantitative single-molecule measurements provide an insight into transport processes of solutes through nanochannels. High-resolution ion conductance measurements in the presence of peptides of different charge and length revealed the kinetics of peptide binding. The observed asymmetry in peptide binding kinetics indicated a unidirectional channel insertion in the lipid bilayer. In the case of cationic peptides, the external voltage acts as a driving force that promotes the interaction of the peptide with the channel surface. At low voltage, the peptide just binds to the channel, whereas at higher voltage, the force is strong enough to pull the peptide across the channel. This allows distinguishing quantitatively between peptide binding and translocation through the channel.},

abstract = {The properties of a nanotube, such as the hydrophobicity and charge of the surface, can significantly affect water transport behavior. However, our knowledge of the effects of charge density, dipole orientation, frequency of flipping, and movement behavior on water flow through carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is far from adequate. This study is aimed at gaining insight into the transport of single-file water molecules in a charged carbon nanotube. It was shown that the water chains inside the charged nanotube exhibit bipolar properties. The water dipoles are parallel to the z-axis, and point toward (D-defect) and away from (L-defect) the center of the nanotube for a negatively charged nanotube and a positively charged one, respectively. Compared with a pristine single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT), the charged nanotubes, including both positively charged and negatively charged, favor the water-filling process due to electrostatic interactions. According to the dipole distribution in the nanotube, the water dipole only flips in the middle region because of the bipolar nature of water chains. Additionally, flipping of the entire water chain is inhibited, which allows for the enhanced water flux. A negatively charged single-walled carbon nanotube (N-SWCNT) accelerated water transport by tuning the single-file flow from a "hopping" to a "continuous" mode, thus decreasing the energy barrier. The hydrogen bonds between water molecules inside the nanotube are also strengthened in the negatively charged nanotube, favoring water transport. Any distortion of uniformity will lead to additional energy barriers to water flux. Our results provide a comprehensive view of molecular events underpinning the water transport inside a SWCNT, which may be of assistance in creating innovative designs for water nanochannels.},

Here, we review current understanding of pLGIC structure, with a focus on the conformational changes underlying channel gating. We compare available structural information and review the evidence supporting the assignment of each structure to a particular conformational state. We discuss multiple factors that may complicate the interpretation of crystal structures, highlighting the potential influence of lipids and detergents.

abstract = {In contrast to water-soluble proteins, membrane proteins reside in a heterogeneous environment, and their surfaces must interact with both polar and apolar membrane regions. As a consequence, the composition of membrane proteins' residues varies substantially between the membrane core and the interfacial regions. The amino acid compositions of helical membrane proteins are also known to be different on the cytoplasmic and extracellular sides of the membrane. Here we report that in the 16 transmembrane beta-barrel structures, the amino acid compositions of lipid-facing residues are different near the N and C termini of the individual strands. Polar amino acids are more prevalent near the C termini than near the N termini, and hydrophobic amino acids show the opposite trend. We suggest that this difference arises because it is easier for polar atoms to escape from the apolar regions of the bilayer at the C terminus of a beta-strand. This new characteristic of beta-barrel membrane proteins enhances our understanding of how a sequence encodes a membrane protein structure and should prove useful in identifying and predicting the structures of trans-membrane beta-barrels.},

These results indicate that modern force fields can reproduce the energy surface near the native structure. To test how well the force fields recapitulate the other regions of the energy surface, MD trajectories for a variant of protein G are compared with data from site-resolved hydrogen exchange (HX) and other biophysical measurements. Because HX monitors the breaking of individual H-bonds, this experimental technique identifies the stability and H-bond content of excited states, thus enabling quantitative comparison with the simulations. Contrary to experimental findings of a cooperative, all-or-none unfolding process, the simulated denatured state ensemble, on average, is highly collapsed with some transient or persistent native 2° structure. The MD trajectories of this protein G variant and other small proteins exhibit excessive intramolecular H-bonding even for the most expanded conformations, suggesting that the force fields require improvements in describing H-bonding and backbone hydration. Moreover, these comparisons provide a general protocol for validating the ability of simulations to accurately capture rare structural fluctuations.},

abstract = {A fundamental role of the Hsp90 chaperone in regulating functional activity of diverse protein clients is essential for the integrity of signaling networks. In this work we have combined biophysical simulations of the Hsp90 crystal structures with the protein structure network analysis to characterize the statistical ensemble of allosteric interaction networks and communication pathways in the Hsp90 chaperones. We have found that principal structurally stable communities could be preserved during dynamic changes in the conformational ensemble. The dominant contribution of the inter-domain rigidity to the interaction networks has emerged as a common factor responsible for the thermodynamic stability of the active chaperone form during the ATPase cycle. Structural stability analysis using force constant profiling of the inter-residue fluctuation distances has identified a network of conserved structurally rigid residues that could serve as global mediating sites of allosteric communication. Mapping of the conformational landscape with the network centrality parameters has demonstrated that stable communities and mediating residues may act concertedly with the shifts in the conformational equilibrium and could describe the majority of functionally significant chaperone residues. The network analysis has revealed a relationship between structural stability, global centrality and functional significance of hotspot residues involved in chaperone regulation. We have found that allosteric interactions in the Hsp90 chaperone may be mediated by modules of structurally stable residues that display high betweenness in the global interaction network. The results of this study have suggested that allosteric interactions in the Hsp90 chaperone may operate via a mechanism that combines rapid and efficient communication by a single optimal pathway of structurally rigid residues and more robust signal transmission using an ensemble of suboptimal multiple communication routes. This may be a universal requirement encoded in protein structures to balance the inherent tension between resilience and efficiency of the residue interaction networks.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major nosocomial pathogen that infects cystic fibrosis and immunocompromised patients. The impermeability of the P. aeruginosa outer membrane contributes substantially to the notorious antibiotic resistance of this human pathogen. This impermeability is partially imparted by the outer membrane protein H (OprH). Here we have solved the structure of OprH in a lipid environment by solution NMR. The structure reveals an eight-stranded $\beta$-barrel protein with four extracellular loops of unequal size. Fast time-scale dynamics measurements show that the extracellular loops are disordered and unstructured. It was previously suggested that the function of OprH is to provide increased stability to the outer membranes of P. aeruginosa by directly interacting with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules. Using in vivo and in vitro biochemical assays, we show that OprH indeed interacts with LPS in P. aeruginosa outer membranes. Based upon NMR chemical shift perturbations observed upon the addition of LPS to OprH in lipid micelles, we conclude that the interaction is predominantly electrostatic and localized to charged regions near both rims of the barrel, but also through two conspicuous tyrosines in the middle of the bilayer. These results provide the first molecular structure of OprH and offer evidence for multiple interactions between OprH and LPS that likely contribute to the antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa.},

Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we studied the response of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine, diphytanoyl-phosphocholine-ester and diphytanoyl-phosphocholine-ether lipid bilayers to an applied electric field. Comparing between lipids with acyl chains and methyl branched chains and between lipids with ether and ester linkages, which change drastically the membrane dipole potential, we found that in both cases the electroporation threshold differed substantially. We show, for the first time, that the electroporation threshold of a lipid bilayer depends not only on the "electrical" properties of the membrane, i.e., its dipole potential, but also on the properties of its component hydrophobic tails.},

abstract = {Biological pores regulate the cellular traffic of a large variety of solutes, often with high selectivity and fast flow rates. These pores share several common structural features: the inner surface of the pore is frequently lined with hydrophobic residues, and the selectivity filter regions often contain charged functional groups. Hydrophobic, narrow-diameter carbon nanotubes can provide a simplified model of membrane channels by reproducing these critical features in a simpler and more robust platform. Previous studies demonstrated that carbon nanotube pores can support a water flux comparable to natural aquaporin channels. Here, we investigate ion transport through these pores using a sub-2-nm, aligned carbon nanotube membrane nanofluidic platform. To mimic the charged groups at the selectivity region, we introduce negatively charged groups at the opening of the carbon nanotubes by plasma treatment. Pressure-driven filtration experiments, coupled with capillary electrophoresis analysis of the permeate and feed, are used to quantify ion exclusion in these membranes as a function of solution ionic strength, pH, and ion valence. We show that carbon nanotube membranes exhibit significant ion exclusion that can be as high as 98% under certain conditions. Our results strongly support a Donnan-type rejection mechanism, dominated by electrostatic interactions between fixed membrane charges and mobile ions, whereas steric and hydrodynamic effects appear to be less important.},

abstract = {Bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, use multidrug efflux pumps to export toxic substrates through their cell membranes. Upon formation of an efflux pump, the aperture of its outer membrane protein TolC opens and thereby enables the extrusion of substrate molecules. The specialty of TolC is its ability to dock to different transporters, making it a highly versatile export protein. Within this study, the transition between two conformations of TolC that are both available as crystal structures was investigated using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. To create a partially open conformation from a closed one, the stability of the periplasmic aperture was weakened by a double point mutation at the constricting ring, which removes some salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. These mutants, which showed partial opening in previous experiments, did not spontaneously open during a 20-ns equilibration at physiological values of the KCl solution. Detailed analysis of the constricting ring revealed that the cations of the solvent were able to constitute ionic bonds in place of the removed salt bridges, which inhibited the opening of the aperture in simulations. To remove the ions from these binding positions within the available simulation time, an extra force was applied onto the ions. To keep the effect of this additional force rather flexible, it was applied in form of an artificial external electric field perpendicular to the membrane. Depending on the field direction and the ion concentration, these simulations led to a partial opening. In experiments, this energy barrier for the ions can be overcome by thermal fluctuations on a longer timescale. © 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Research in the past decade has revealed that many cytosolic proteins are recruited to different cellular membranes to form protein-protein and lipid-protein interactions during cell signaling and membrane trafficking. Membrane recruitment of these peripheral proteins is mediated by a growing number of modular membrane-targeting domains, including C1, C2, PH, FYVE, PX, ENTH, ANTH, BAR, FERM, and tubby domains, that recognize specific lipid molecules in the membranes. Structural studies of these membrane-targeting domains demonstrate how they specifically recognize their cognate lipid ligands. However, the mechanisms by which these domains and their host proteins are recruited to and interact with various cell membranes are only beginning to unravel with recent computational studies, in vitro membrane binding studies using model membranes, and cellular translocation studies using fluorescent protein-tagged proteins. This review summarizes the recent progress in our understanding of how the kinetics and energetics of membrane-protein interactions are regulated during the cellular membrane targeting and activation of peripheral proteins.},

In bacteria, MS channels prevent cells from lysing upon sudden hypoosmotic shock by opening and releasing solutes and water. Despite the importance of MS channels and ongoing efforts to explain their functioning, the molecular mechanism of MS channel gating remains elusive and controversial. Here we report a method that allows single-subunit resolution for manipulating and monitoring "mechanosensitive channel of large conductance" from Escherichia coli. We gradually changed the hydrophobicity of the pore constriction in this homopentameric protein by modifying a critical pore residue one subunit at a time. Our experimental results suggest that both channel opening and closing are initiated by the transmembrane 1 helix of a single subunit and that the participation of each of the five identical subunits in the structural transitions between the closed and open states is asymmetrical. Such a minimal change in the pore environment seems ideal for a fast and energy-efficient response to changes in the membrane tension.},

After equilibration and a nanosecond production run, the OmpF trimer exhibits a C-alpha root mean square deviation from the crystal structure of 0.23 nm and a stable secondary structure. No evidence is found for large-scale motions of the L3 loop. We investigate the pore dimensions, conductance, and the properties of water inside the pore. This water forms a complicated pattern, even when averaged over 1 ns of simulation time. Around the pore constriction zone the water dipoles are highly structured in the plane of the membrane, oriented by the strong transversal electric field. In addition, there is a net orientation along the pore axis pointing from the extracellular to the intracellular side of the bilayer. The diffusion coefficients of water inside the pore are greatly reduced compared to bulk. We compare our results to results from model pores (Breed et al., 1996. Biophys.

abstract = {Specific separations of protons and cations are usually performed by electromembrane processes, which require external electric energy. An easier process would be using a membrane able to separate both entities by passive diffusion. Presently, such synthetic nanoporous membranes do not exist. Here, we report the production of a robust hybrid biological/artificial solid-state membrane, which allows selective permeation of alkali metal cations without competing or concurrent permeation of protons. This membrane is simple to prepare and is based on the hydrophobic nature of the polymeric pore walls, and the confined gramicidin A molecules within. This work opens a new route for separation in the domain of nanobiofiltration, especially for tunable nanodevices based on differential ion conduction, with a fundamental understanding of the confinement mechanism.},

abstract = {Acetylcholine receptor-channels are allosteric proteins that isomerize ('gate') between conformations that have a low vs. high affinity for the transmitter and conductance for ions. In order to comprehend the mechanism by which the affinity and conductance changes are linked it is of value to know the magnitude, timing and distribution of energy flowing through the system. Knowing both the di- and unliganded gating equilibrium constants (E(2) and E(0)) is a foundation for understanding the AChR gating mechanism and for engineering both the ligand and the protein to operate in predictable ways. In adult mouse neuromuscular receptors activated by acetylcholine, E(2) = 28 and E(0) approximately 6.5 x 10(7). At each (equivalent) transmitter binding site acetylcholine provides approximately 5.2 kcal mol(1) to motivate the isomerization. The partial agonist choline provides approximately 3.3 kcal mol(1). The relative time of a residue's gating energy change is revealed by the slope of its rate-equilibrium constant relationship. A map of this parameter suggests that energy propagates as a conformational cascade between the transmitter binding sites and the gate region. Although gating energy changes are widespread throughout the protein, some residues are particularly sensitive to perturbations. Several specific proposals for the structural events that comprise the gating conformational cascade are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been proposed that arginine residues lining the intracellular portals of the homomeric 5-HT3 A receptor cause electrostatic repulsion of cation flow, accounting for a single channel conductance substantially lower than that of the 5-HT3 AB heteromer. However, comparison of receptor homology models for wild-type pentamers suggests that salt bridges in the intracellular domain of the homomer may impart structural rigidity, and we hypothesised that this rigidity could account for the low conductance.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Mutations were introduced into the portal region of the human 5-HT3 A homopentamer such that putative salt bridges were broken by neutralising anionic partners. Single channel and whole cell currents were measured in transfected tsA201 cells and in Xenopus oocytes, respectively. Computational simulations of protein flexibility facilitated comparison of wild-type and mutant receptors.\n\nKEY RESULTS: Single channel conductance was increased substantially, often to wild-type heteromeric receptor values, in most 5-HT3 A mutants. Conversely, introduction of arginine residues to the portal region of the heteromer, conjecturally creating salt bridges, decreased conductance. Gating kinetics varied significantly between different mutant receptors. EC50 values for whole-cell responses to 5-HT remained largely unchanged, but Hill coefficients for responses to 5-HT were usually significantly smaller in mutants. Computational simulations suggested increased flexibility throughout the protein structure as a consequence of mutations in the intracellular domain.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These data support a role for intracellular salt bridges in maintaining quaternary structure of the 5-HT3 receptor and suggest a role for the intracellular domain in allosteric modulation of cooperativity and agonist efficacy.},

abstract = {In the accompanying paper we derived a set of principles that, we argue, govern the structure of beta-sheet barrels. Barrel structures are classified in terms of two integral parameters: the number of strands in the beta-sheet, n, and a measure of the stagger in the beta-sheet, S. We derived a set of equations that show how the (n, S) values of a barrel structure determine the arrangement of its strands; its general shape; the twist and coiling of the beta-sheet, and the arrangement of residues in the barrel interior. This work suggested that there are ten different combinations of n and S that form barrels with good beta-sheet geometries and interiors close packed by beta-sheet residues. In this paper we demonstrate the validity of these principles. We analyse in detail the observed structures of 39 different beta-sheet barrels. These structures include representatives of all the different barrel structures currently known and for which atomic co-ordinates are available. We show that the observed arrangement of the strands, and the extent of the twist and coiling of the beta-sheets, are very close to those calculated from the (n, S) values for the barrel. Of the 39 structures, 34 have one of the ten (n, S) values that we expect to form barrels with good beta-sheet geometries and interiors close packed by beta-sheet residues. The other five have one of two (n, S) values that give good beta-sheet geometries but radii so large the beta-sheet residues leave cavities at the centre of the barrels. In at least four of these cavities have a functional role.},

abstract = {All-atom molecular dynamics simulations are widely used to study the flexibility of protein conformations. However, enhanced sampling techniques are required for simulating protein dynamics that occur on the millisecond timescale. In this work, we show that torsional molecular dynamics simulations enhance protein conformational sampling by performing conformational search in the low-frequency torsional degrees of freedom. In this article, we use our recently developed torsional-dynamics method called Generalized Newton-Euler Inverse Mass Operator (GNEIMO) to study the conformational dynamics of four proteins. We investigate the use of the GNEIMO method in simulations of the conformationally flexible proteins fasciculin and calmodulin, as well as the less flexible crambin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. For the latter two proteins, the GNEIMO simulations with an implicit-solvent model reproduced the average protein structural fluctuations and sample conformations similar to those from Cartesian simulations with explicit solvent. The application of GNEIMO with replica exchange to the study of fasciculin conformational dynamics produced sampling of two of this protein's experimentally established conformational substates. Conformational transition of calmodulin from the Ca(2+)-bound to the Ca(2+)-free conformation occurred readily with GNEIMO simulations. Moreover, the GNEIMO method generated an ensemble of conformations that satisfy about half of both short- and long-range interresidue distances obtained from NMR structures of holo to apo transitions in calmodulin. Although unconstrained all-atom Cartesian simulations have failed to sample transitions between the substates of fasciculin and calmodulin, GNEIMO simulations show the transitions in both systems. The relatively short simulation times required to capture these long-timescale conformational dynamics indicate that GNEIMO is a promising molecular-dynamics technique for studying domain motion in proteins.},

abstract = {In this study we introduce a computationally-driven enzyme redesign workflow for altering cofactor specificity from NADPH to NADH. By compiling and comparing data from previous studies involving cofactor switching mutations, we show that their effect cannot be explained as straightforward changes in volume, hydrophobicity, charge, or BLOSUM62 scores of the residues populating the cofactor binding site. Instead, we find that the use of a detailed cofactor binding energy approximation is needed to adequately capture the relative affinity towards different cofactors. The implicit solvation models Generalized Born with molecular volume integration and Generalized Born with simple switching were integrated in the iterative protein redesign and optimization (IPRO) framework to drive the redesign of Candida boidinii xylose reductase (CbXR) to function using the non-native cofactor NADH. We identified 10 variants, out of the 8,000 possible combinations of mutations, that improve the computationally assessed binding affinity for NADH by introducing mutations in the CbXR binding pocket. Experimental testing revealed that seven out of ten possessed significant xylose reductase activity utilizing NADH, with the best experimental design (CbXR-GGD) being 27-fold more active on NADH. The NADPH-dependent activity for eight out of ten predicted designs was either completely abolished or significantly diminished by at least 90%, yielding a greater than 10(4)-fold change in specificity to NADH (CbXR-REG). The remaining two variants (CbXR-RTT and CBXR-EQR) had dual cofactor specificity for both nicotinamide cofactors.},

The extracellular domains of these proteins contain six amino acid loops (A-F) that converge to form the ligand binding site. In this study we have mutated 21 residues in or close to the 5-HT(3) receptor F-loop (Ile(192) to Gly(212)) to Ala or to a residue with similar chemical properties. Mutant receptors were expressed in HEK293 cells, and binding affinity was measured using [(3)H]granisetron. Two regions displayed decreases in binding affinity when mutated to Ala (Ile(192)-Arg(196) and Asp(204)-Ser(206)), but only one region was sensitive when mutated to chemically similar residues (Ile(192)-Val(201)). Homology modeling using acetylcholine-binding protein crystal structures with a variety of different bound ligands suggests there may be distinct movements of Trp(195) and Asp(204) upon ligand binding, indicating that these residues and their immediate neighbors have the ability to interact differently with different ligands. The models suggest predominantly lateral movement around Asp(204) and rotational movement around Trp(195), indicating the former is in a more flexible region. Overall our results are consistent with a flexible 5-HT(3) receptor F-loop with two regions that have specific but distinct roles in ligand binding.},

The magnitude and location of these forces corresponded to those determined from the lateral pressure profile computed from a lipid bilayer simulation. A fully expanded state was obtained on the 10-ns timescale that revealed the mechanism for transducing membrane forces into channel opening. The expanded state agrees well with proposed models of MscL gating, in that it entails an irislike expansion of the pore accompanied by tilting of the transmembrane helices. The channel was most easily opened when force was applied predominantly on the cytoplasmic side of MscL. Comparison of simulations in which gating progressed to varying degrees identified residues that pose steric hindrance to channel opening.},

abstract = {The permeation of hydrophobic, cylindrical nanopores by water molecules and ions is investigated under equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium conditions by extensive molecular-dynamics simulations. Neglecting the chemical structure of the confining pore surface, we focus on the effects of pore radius and electric field on permeation. The simulations confirm the intermittent filling of the pore by water, reported earlier under equilibrium conditions for pore radii larger than a critical radius R(c). Below this radius, water can still permeate the pore under the action of a strong electric field generated by an ion concentration imbalance at both ends of the pore embedded in a structureless membrane. The water driven into the channel undergoes considerable electrostriction characterized by a mean density up to twice the bulk density and by a dramatic drop in dielectric permittivity which can be traced back to a considerable distortion of the hydrogen-bond network inside the pore. The free-energy barrier to ion permeation is estimated by a variant of umbrella sampling for Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+), and Cl(-) ions, and correlates well with known solvation free energies in bulk water. Starting from an initial imbalance in ion concentration, equilibrium is gradually restored by successive ion passages through the water-filled pore. At each passage the electric field across the pore drops, reducing the initial electrostriction, until the pore, of radius less than R(c), closes to water and hence to ion transport, thus providing a possible mechanism for voltage-dependent gating of hydrophobic pores.},

abstract = {Glutamate transporters regulate synaptic concentrations of this neurotransmitter by coupling its flux to that of sodium and other cations. Available crystal structures of an archeal homologue of these transporters, GltPh, resemble an extracellular-facing state, in which the bound substrate is occluded only by a small helical hairpin segment called HP2. However, a pathway to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane is not clearly apparent. We previously modeled an alternate state of a transporter from the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter family, which has an entirely different fold, solely on the presence of inverted-topology structural repeats. In GltPh, we identified two distinct sets of inverted-topology repeats and used these repeats to model an inward-facing conformation of the protein. To test this model, we introduced pairs of cysteines into the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1, at positions that are >27 A apart in the crystal structures of GltPh, but approximately = 10 A apart in the inward-facing model. Transport by these mutants was activated by pretreatment with the reducing agent dithithreitol. Subsequent treatment with the oxidizing agent copper(II)(1,10-phenantroline)(3) abolished this activation. The inhibition of transport was potentiated under conditions thought to promote the inward-facing conformation of the transporter. By contrast, the inhibition was reduced in the presence of the nontransportable substrate analogue D,L-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate, which favors the outward-facing conformation. Other conformation-sensitive accessibility measurements are also accommodated by our inward-facing model. These results suggest that the inclusion of inverted-topology repeats in transporters may provide a general solution to the requirement for two symmetry-related states in a single protein.},

abstract = {We report herein the design, total synthesis, and functional analysis of a novel artificial ion channel molecule, designated as dansylated polytheonamide mimic (3). The channel 3 was designed based on an exceptionally potent cytotoxin, polytheonamide B (1). Our strategy for the development of synthetic ion channels, which could be easily derivatized for various functions, involved two key features. First, the structure of 1 was simplified by replacing many of nonproteinogenic amino acid residues which required multistep synthesis by commercially available amino acids while retaining those residues necessary for folding. It significantly reduced the number of synthetic steps and facilitated a practical chemical construction of 3. Second, the introduction of propargyl glycine at residue 44 enabled facile installation of dansyl group as a reporter of the membrane localization of 3. Application of a newly designed protective group strategy provided efficient construction of the 37 amino acid sequence of residues 12-48 through one automatic solid-phase peptide synthesis. After peptide cleavage from the resin, 3 was synthesized via dansyl group introduction and one fragment-coupling reaction with residues 1-11, followed by the global deprotection. The simplified mimic 3 exhibited potent cytotoxicity toward p388 mouse leukemia cells (IC(50) = 12 nM), effectively induced ion transport across the lipid bilayers of liposomes, and displayed H(+) and Na(+) ion channel activities. Because of its simplified yet functional scaffold structure with a potential for diversification, our rationally designed ion channel molecule should be useful as a novel platform for developing various cytotoxic channel molecules with additional desired functions.},

abstract = {In molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayers, the structure is sensitive to the precise treatment of electrostatics. The dipole-dipole interactions between headgroup dipoles are not long-ranged, but the area per lipid and, through it, other properties of the bilayer are very sensitive to the detailed balance between the perpendicular and in-plane components of the headgroup dipoles. This is affected by the detailed properties of the cutoff scheme or if long-range interactions are included by Ewald or particle-mesh Ewald techniques. Interaction between the in-plane components of the headgroup dipoles is attractive and decays as the inverse sixth power of distance. The interaction is screened by the square of a dielectric permittivity close to the value for water. Interaction between the components perpendicular to the membrane plane is repulsive and decays as the inverse third power of distance. These interactions are screened by a dielectric permittivity of the order 10. Thus, despite the perpendicular components being much smaller in magnitude than the in-plane components, they will dominate the interaction energies at large distances.},

The protein named OpdK, a member of OprD family, plays an important role in transporting the vanillate as the only carbon source of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa infections can be serious due to the high intrinsic antibiotic resistance owing to the present of the OprD family. We applied standard molecular dynamics, steered molecular dynamics and umbrella sampling, to investigate the thermodynamics of vanillate passing through the pore of OpdK protein at physiological temperature. The results indicate that hydrogen bonds of vanillate-L3 (L3: Gly92-Gln111) and hydrophobic interactions of vanillate-L7 (Gly252-Asn278) are crucial to the transport of vanillate. Compared to L7, L3 can hardly change the shape of the pore, but its amino acids can effectively affect the transport process. The important role of charged residues in the barrel of the protein for the substrate transport has been proved in the experiment researches and our simulations also determinate that these residues may prevent the vanillate from entering the cell. These results provide detailed information that will facilitate the development of effective drugs.},

@article{Vernier2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nanosecond, megavolt-per-meter pulsed electric fields scramble membrane phospholipids, release intracellular calcium, and induce apoptosis. Flow cytometric and fluorescence microscopy evidence has associated phospholipid rearrangement directly with nanoelectropulse exposure and supports the hypothesis that the potential that develops across the lipid bilayer during an electric pulse drives phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization. RESULTS: In this work we extend observations of cells exposed to electric pulses with 30 ns and 7 ns durations to still narrower pulse widths, and we find that even 3 ns pulses are sufficient to produce responses similar to those reported previously. We show here that in contrast to unipolar pulses, which perturb membrane phospholipid order, tracked with FM1-43 fluorescence, only at the anode side of the cell, bipolar pulses redistribute phospholipids at both the anode and cathode poles, consistent with migration of the anionic PS head group in the transmembrane field. In addition, we demonstrate that, as predicted by the membrane charging hypothesis, a train of shorter pulses requires higher fields to produce phospholipid scrambling comparable to that produced by a time-equivalent train of longer pulses (for a given applied field, 30, 4 ns pulses produce a weaker response than 4, 30 ns pulses). Finally, we show that influx of YO-PRO-1, a fluorescent dye used to detect early apoptosis and activation of the purinergic P2X7 receptor channels, is observed after exposure of Jurkat T lymphoblasts to sufficiently large numbers of pulses, suggesting that membrane poration occurs even with nanosecond pulses when the electric field is high enough. Propidium iodide entry, a traditional indicator of electroporation, occurs with even higher pulse counts. CONCLUSION: Megavolt-per-meter electric pulses as short as 3 ns alter the structure of the plasma membrane and permeabilize the cell to small molecules. The dose responses of cells to unipolar and bipolar pulses ranging from 3 ns to 30 ns duration support the hypothesis that a field-driven charging of the membrane dielectric causes the formation of pores on a nanosecond time scale, and that the anionic phospholipid PS migrates electrophoretically along the wall of these pores to the external face of the membrane.},

abstract = {Chemokines and their receptors regulate cell migration during development, immune system function, and in inflammatory diseases, making them important therapeutic targets. Nevertheless, the structural basis of receptor:chemokine interaction is poorly understood. Adding to the complexity of the problem is the persistently dimeric behavior of receptors observed in cell-based studies, which in combination with structural and mutagenesis data, suggest several possibilities for receptor:chemokine complex stoichiometry. In this study, a combination of computational, functional, and biophysical approaches was used to elucidate the stoichiometry and geometry of the interaction between the CXC-type chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and its ligand CXCL12. First, relevance and feasibility of a 2:1 stoichiometry hypothesis was probed using functional complementation experiments with multiple pairs of complementary nonfunctional CXCR4 mutants. Next, the importance of dimers of WT CXCR4 was explored using the strategy of dimer dilution, where WT receptor dimerization is disrupted by increasing expression of nonfunctional CXCR4 mutants. The results of these experiments were supportive of a 1:1 stoichiometry, although the latter could not simultaneously reconcile existing structural and mutagenesis data. To resolve the contradiction, cysteine trapping experiments were used to derive residue proximity constraints that enabled construction of a validated 1:1 receptor:chemokine model, consistent with the paradigmatic two-site hypothesis of receptor activation. The observation of a 1:1 stoichiometry is in line with accumulating evidence supporting monomers as minimal functional units of G protein-coupled receptors, and suggests transmission of conformational changes across the dimer interface as the most probable mechanism of altered signaling by receptor heterodimers.},

abstract = {Neurotransmitter binding to Cys-loop receptors promotes a prodigious transmembrane flux of several million ions/s, but to date, structural determinants of ion flux have been identified flanking the membrane-spanning region. Using x-ray crystallography, sequence analysis, and single-channel recording, we identified a novel determinant of ion conductance near the point of entry of permeant ions. Co-crystallization of acetylcholine-binding protein with sulfate anions revealed coordination of SO4(2-) with a ring of lysines at a position equivalent to 24 A above the lipid membrane in homologous Cys-loop receptors. Analysis of multiple sequence alignments revealed that residues equivalent to the ring of lysines are negatively charged in cation-selective receptors but are positively charged in anion-selective receptors. Charge reversal of side chains at homologous positions in the nicotinic receptor from the motor end plate decreases unitary conductance up to 80%. Selectivity filters stemming from transmembrane alpha-helices have similar pore diameters and compositions of amino acids. These findings establish that when the channel opens under a physiological electrochemical gradient, permeant ions are initially stabilized within the extracellular vestibule of Cys-loop receptors, and this stabilization is a major determinant of ion conductance.},

abstract = {Key mutations differentiate the functions of homologous proteins. One example compares the inward ion pump halorhodopsin (HR) and the outward proton pump bacteriorhodopsin (BR). Of the nine essential buried ionizable residues in BR, six are conserved in HR. However, HR changes three BR acids, D85 in a central cluster of ionizable residues, D96, nearer the intracellular, and E204, nearer the extracellular side of the membrane to the small, neutral amino acids T111, V122, and T230, respectively. In BR, acidic amino acids are stationary anions whose proton affinity is modulated by conformational changes, establishing a sequence of directed binding and release of protons. Multiconformation continuum electrostatics calculations of chloride affinity and residue protonation show that, in reaction intermediates where an acid is ionized in BR, a Cl(-) is bound to HR in a position near the deleted acid. In the HR ground state, Cl(-) binds tightly to the central cluster T111 site and weakly to the extracellular T230 site, recovering the charges on ionized BR-D85 and neutral E204 in BR. Imposing key conformational changes from the BR M intermediate into the HR structure results in the loss of Cl(-) from the central T111 site and the tight binding of Cl(-) to the extracellular T230 site, mirroring the changes that protonate BR-D85 and ionize E204 in BR. The use of a mobile chloride in place of D85 and E204 makes HR more susceptible to the environmental pH and salt concentrations than BR. These studies shed light on how ion transfer mechanisms are controlled through the interplay of protein and ion electrostatics.},

abstract = {The transmembrane potential generated by an alternating electric field (ac) depends strongly on the frequency of the field and can be calculated using the Schwan Equation. We have measured the critical electric breakdown potential, delta psi crit, of the plasma membrane of murine myeloma cell line (Tib9) using ac fields, by monitoring the entry of a fluorescence probe, propidium iodide, into the cells. This dye is weakly fluorescent in solution but becomes strongly fluorescent when it binds to DNA. Experiments were done under a microscope by direct visual examination of single cells or by examining photographic prints. When an ac field reached the intensity, Ecrit, that generated a maximal membrane potential delta psi max, equal to or greater than the delta psi crit, the membrane was perforated at the two loci facing the electrodes. The dye diffused into the cell, giving rise to two bright, narrow bands, which expanded to the whole cell in 1-3 min. delta psi crit's were measured in three media of different resistivities, rho ext, (52,600, 7,050, and 2,380 omega cm), over the range of 0.1-300 kHz, with the field duration of 200 ms. Regression analysis based on the Schwan Equation showed that in a medium of given resistivity, the delta psi crit was constant over the frequency range studied. When the capacitance of the membrane, Cmembr, was taken to be 0.90 microF cm-2, the resistivity of the cytoplasmic medium, rho int, was determined to be 910-1,100 omega cm. The delta psi crit were 0.33, 0.48, and 0.53 V, respectively, for the three media in decreasing resistivities. The good fit of these data to the curves calculated using the Schwan Equation indicates that the equation may be used to describe the transmembrane potential of a living cell generated by an oscillating electric field.},

Here we show how nearly diffusion-limited rates are achieved, by analysing ion conduction and the corresponding crystallographic ion distribution in the selectivity filter of the KcsA K+ channel. Measurements with K+ and its slightly larger analogue, Rb+, lead us to conclude that the selectivity filter usually contains two K+ ions separated by one water molecule. The two ions move in a concerted fashion between two configurations, K+-water-K+-water (1,3 configuration) and water-K+-water-K+ (2,4 configuration), until a third ion enters, displacing the ion on the opposite side of the queue.

abstract = {The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is the major protein in the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it mediates transport of ATP and ADP. Changes in its permeability, induced by voltage or apoptosis-related proteins, have been implicated in apoptotic pathways. The three-dimensional structure of VDAC has recently been determined as a 19-stranded ??-barrel with an in-lying N-terminal helix. However, its gating mechanism is still unclear. Using solid-state NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and electrophysiology, we show that deletion of the rigid N-terminal helix sharply increases overall motion in VDAC's ??-barrel, resulting in elliptic, semicollapsed barrel shapes. These states quantitatively reproduce conductance and selectivity of the closed VDAC conformation. Mutation of the N-terminal helix leads to a phenotype intermediate to the open and closed states. These data suggest that the N-terminal helix controls entry into elliptic ??-barrel states which underlie VDAC closure. Our results also indicate that ??-barrel channels are intrinsically flexible. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A mean-field approach to the electrostatics for solutes in electrolyte solution is revisited and rigorously justified. In this approach, an electrostatic free energy functional is constructed that depends solely on the local ionic concentrations. The unique set of such concentrations that minimize this free energy are given by the usual Boltzmann distributions through the electrostatic potential which is determined by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. This approach is then applied to the variational implicit solvent description of the solvation of molecules [Dzubiella, Swanson, McCammon, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2006, 96, 087802; J. Chem. Phys. 2006, 124, 084905]. Care is taken for the singularities of the potential generated by the solute point charges. The variation of the electrostatic free energy with respect to the location change of solute-solvent interfaces, that is, dielectric boundaries, is derived. Such a variation gives rise to the normal component of the effective surface force per unit surface area that is shown to be attractive to the fixed point charges in the solutes. Two examples of applications are given to validate the analytical results. The first one is a one-dimensional model system resembling, for example, a charged solute or cavity in a one-dimensional channel. The second one, which is of its own interest, is the electrostatic free energy of a charged spherical solute immersed in an ionic solution. An analytical formula is derived for the Debye-H\"{u}ckel approximation of the free energy, extending the classical Born's formula to one that includes ionic concentrations. Variations of the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann free energy are also obtained.},

We duplicated the sequence of OmpX, an eight-stranded $\beta$-barrel protein of known structure, and obtained a $\beta$-barrel, designated Omp2X, which can fold in vitro and in vivo. Using single-channel conductance measurements and PEG exclusion assays, we found that Omp2X has a pore size similar to that of OmpC, a natural 16-stranded barrel. Fusions of the homologous proteins OmpX, OmpA and OmpW were able to fold in vitro in all combinations tested, revealing that the general propensity to form a $\beta$-barrel is sufficient to evolve larger barrels by simple genetic events. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The interaction of phosphate ions with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa anion-specific protein P channel was probed. The single-channel conductance of protein P incorporated into planar lipid bilayer membranes in the presence of 0.3 M H2PO-4 was shown to be 6.0 pS, demonstrating that protein P channels allowed the permeation of phosphate. When large numbers of protein P channels were incorporated into lipid bilayer membranes in the presence of 40 mM Cl-, addition of small concentrations of phosphate resulted in reduction of macroscopic Cl- conductance in a dose- (and pH-) dependent fashion. This allowed calculation of an I50 value of e.g. 0.46 mM at pH 7.0, suggesting that the affinity of protein P for its normal substrate phosphate was at least 60-100-fold greater than the affinity of the channel for other ions such as chloride. Pyrophosphate and the phosphate analogue, arsenate, also inhibited macroscopic Cl- conductance through protein P with I50 values at pH 7.0 of 4.9 mM and 1.3 mM, respectively. To probe the nature of the phosphate binding site, the epsilon-amino groups of available lysine residues of protein P were chemically modified. Acetylation and carbamylation which produced uncharged, modified lysines destroyed both the anion (e.g. Cl-) binding site and the phosphate binding site as determined by single-channel experiments and macroscopic conductance inhibition experiments respectively. Nevertheless, the modified proteins still retained their trimeric configuration and their ability to reconstitute single channels in lipid bilayer membranes. Methylation, which allowed retention of the charge on the modified lysine residues, increased the Kd of the channel for Cl- 33-fold and the I50 for phosphate inhibition of macroscopic Cl- conductance 2.5-4-fold. A molecular model for the phosphate binding site of the protein P channel is presented.},

abstract = {Water confined into the interior channels of narrow carbon nanotubes or transmembrane proteins forms collectively oriented molecular wires held together by tight hydrogen bonds. Here, we explore the thermodynamic stability and dipolar orientation of such 1D water chains from nanoscopic to macroscopic dimensions. We show that a dipole lattice model accurately recovers key properties of 1D confined water when compared to atomically detailed simulations. In a major reduction in computational complexity, we represent the dipole model in terms of effective Coulombic charges, which allows us to study pores of macroscopic lengths in equilibrium with a water bath (or vapor). We find that at ambient conditions, the water chains filling the tube are essentially continuous up to macroscopic dimensions. At reduced water vapor pressure, we observe a 1D Ising-like filling/emptying transition without a true phase transition in the thermodynamic limit. In the filled state, the chains of water molecules in the tube remain dipole-ordered up to macroscopic lengths of approximately 0.1 mm, and the dipolar order is estimated to persist for times up to approximately 0.1 s. The observed dipolar order in continuous water chains is a precondition for the use of nanoconfined 1D water as mediator of fast long-range proton transport, e.g., in fuel cells. For water-filled nanotube bundles and membranes, we expect anti-ferroelectric behavior, resulting in a rich phase diagram similar to that of a 2D Coulomb gas.},

abstract = {First-principles calculations for the electronic and geometric structures of three different types of armchair silicon carbide nanotubes from (3, 3) to (11, 11) have been performed using hybrid density functional theory and the finite cluster approximation. Full geometry and spin optimizations have been performed without any symmetry constraints. A detailed comparison of the structures and stabilities of the three types of nanotubes is presented. For type 1 nanotube, the cohesive energy appears to saturate at 4.63 eV, whereas for type 2 and 3 nanotubes, the cohesive energy saturates at approximately 4.44 eV. The dependence of the electronic band gaps on the respective tube diameters, energy density of states, and dipole moments as well as Mulliken charge distributions have been investigated. For type 1 nanotubes, Si atoms moved toward the tube axis and C atoms moved in the opposite direction after relaxation, consistent with other SiC nanotubes found in literature. For type 2 and the newly proposed type 3, this displacement direction is reversed. The band gaps for type 1 nanotubes are larger than bulk 3C-SiC gap, varying between 2.78 and 2.91 eV, while type 2 and type 3 nanotubes have significantly lower band gaps. Unlike the other two types, band gap for type 3 nanotubes decreases monotonically with increasing tube diameter from 1.22 eV for the smallest tube to 0.79 eV for the largest (11, 11) tube studied here. The corresponding numbers for type 2 are 1.49 and 0.91 eV with an oscillatory pattern. None of the tubes appear to be magnetic. It is expected that these tubes will have interesting and important applications in the field of band gap engineering and molecular electronics.},

We demonstrate that the use of orientational restraints can greatly accelerate the convergence of these calculations. However, even with this acceleration, we find that sufficient sampling requires substantially longer simulations than are used in many published protocols. To further accelerate convergence, we introduce a new method of configuration space decomposition by orientation which reduces required simulation lengths by at least a factor of 5 in the cases examined. Our method is easily parallelizable, well suited for cases where a ligand cocrystal structure is not available, and can utilize initial orientations generated by docking packages.},

abstract = {We have shown from both simulations and experiments that zwitterion functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be used to construct highly efficient desalination membranes. Our simulations predicted that zwitterion functional groups at the ends of CNTs allow a high flux of water, while rejecting essentially all ions. We have synthesized zwitterion functionalized CNT/polyamide nanocomposite membranes with varying loadings of CNTs and assessed these membranes for water desalination. The CNTs within the polyamide layer were partially aligned through a high-vacuum filtration step during membrane synthesis. Addition of zwitterion functionalized CNTs into a polyamide membrane increased both the flux of water and the salt rejection ratio. The flux of water was found to increase by more than a factor of 4, from 6.8 to 28.7 GFD (gallons per square foot per day), as the fraction of CNTs was increased from 0 to 20 wt %. Importantly, the ion rejection ratio increased slightly from 97.6% to 98.6%. Thus, the nanotubes imparted an additional transport mechanism to the polyamide membrane, having higher flow rate and the same or slightly better selectivity. Simulations show that when two zwitterions are attached to each end of CNTs having diameters of about 15 \AA, the ion rejection ratio is essentially 100%. In contrast, the rejection ratio for nonfunctionalized CNTs is about 0%, and roughly 20% for CNTs having five carboxylic acid groups per end. The increase in ion rejection for the zwitterion functionalized CNTs is due to a combination of steric hindrance from the functional groups partially blocking the tube ends and electrostatic repulsion between functional groups and ions, with steric effects dominating. Theoretical predictions indicate that an ideal CNT/polymer membrane having a loading of 20 wt % CNTs would have a maximum flux of about 20000 GFD at the conditions of our experiments.},

abstract = {Diffusion of proteins on lipid membranes plays a central role in cell signaling processes. From a mathematical perspective, most membrane diffusion processes are explained by the Saffman-Delbrück theory. However, recent studies have suggested a major limitation in the theoretical framework, the lack of complexity in the modeled lipid membrane. Lipid domains (sometimes termed membrane rafts) are known to slow protein diffusion, but there have been no quantitative theoretical examinations of how much diffusion is slowed in a general case. We provide an overall theoretical framework for confined-domain ("corralled") diffusion. Further, there have been multiple apparent contradictions of the basic conclusions of Saffman and Delbrück, each involving cases in which a single protein or an oligomer has multiple transmembrane regions passing through a lipid phase barrier. We present a set of corrections to the Saffman-Delbrück theory to account for these experimental observations. Our corrections are able to provide a quantitative explanation of numerous cellular signaling processes that have been considered beyond the scope of the Saffman-Delbrück theory, and may be extendable to other forms of subdiffusion.},

abstract = {Confinement of matter on the nanometre scale can induce phase transitions not seen in bulk systems. In the case of water, so-called drying transitions occur on this scale as a result of strong hydrogen-bonding between water molecules, which can cause the liquid to recede from nonpolar surfaces to form a vapour layer separating the bulk phase from the surface. Here we report molecular dynamics simulations showing spontaneous and continuous filling of a nonpolar carbon nanotube with a one-dimensionally ordered chain of water molecules. Although the molecules forming the chain are in chemical and thermal equilibrium with the surrounding bath, we observe pulse-like transmission of water through the nanotube. These transmission bursts result from the tight hydrogen-bonding network inside the tube, which ensures that density fluctuations in the surrounding bath lead to concerted and rapid motion along the tube axis. We also find that a minute reduction in the attraction between the tube wall and water dramatically affects pore hydration, leading to sharp, two-state transitions between empty and filled states on a nanosecond timescale. These observations suggest that carbon nanotubes, with their rigid nonpolar structures, might be exploited as unique molecular channels for water and protons, with the channel occupancy and conductivity tunable by changes in the local channel polarity and solvent conditions.},

Organization in soft materials emerges from the competition between physical and chemical interactions acting on different length scales; the geometry of the system modulates this competition and, hence, dictates its structure and function. Theoretical studies of molecular organization in planar and curved geometries require the treatment of the coupling between interactions, chemical equilibrium and geometrical constraints. We analyse here how curvature affects the morphology of polymers on nano-curved surfaces and determines the apparent equilibrium constants of surface-confined chemical reactions, such as acid–base chemistry. We also review the practical implications of introducing soft materials into nanofluidic devices. In particular, we present and discuss recent theoretical studies and simulations of the transport of ions, solvent and large cargoes through polyelectrolyte-brush-modified pores. We believe that this basic understanding will guide experimental efforts towards the design of stimuli-responsive nanopore gates.},

abstract = {The hydrogen bonding of polar side-chains has emerged as an important theme for membrane protein interactions. The crystal structure of the dimeric state of the transmembrane ??-barrel protein outer membrane phospholipase A (OMPLA) revealed an intermolecular hydrogen bond mediated by a highly conserved glutamine side-chain (Q94). It has been shown that the introduction of a polar residue can drive the association of model helices, and by extension it was presumed that the glutamine hydrogen bond played a key role in stabilizing the OMPLA dimer. However, a thermodynamic investigation using sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation in detergent micelles reveals that the hydrogen bond plays only a very modest role in stabilizing the dimer. The Q94 side-chain is hydrogen bonded intramolecularly to residues Y92 and S96, but amino acid substitutions at these positions suggest these intramolecular interactions are not responsible for attenuating the strength of the intermolecular Q94 hydrogen bond. Other substitutions suggested that hydration of the local environment around Q94 may be responsible for the modest strength of the hydrogen bond. Heat inactivation experiments with the variants suggest that the Y92-Q94-S96 network may instead be important for thermal stability of the monomer. These results highlight the context dependence and broad range of interactions that can be mediated by polar residues in membrane proteins. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Guven2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently we reported a nanocontainer based reduction triggered release system through an engineered transmembrane channel (FhuA Delta1-160; Onaca et al., 2008). Compound fluxes within the FhuA Delta1-160 channel protein are controlled sterically through labeled lysine residues (label: 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionic-acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester). Quantifying the sterical contribution of each labeled lysine would open up an opportunity for designing compound specific drug release systems.

RESULTS: In total, 12 FhuA Delta1-160 variants were generated to gain insights on sterically controlled compound fluxes: Subset A) six FhuA Delta1-160 variants in which one of the six lysines in the interior of FhuA Delta1-160 was substituted to alanine and Subset B) six FhuA Delta1-160 variants in which only one lysine inside the barrel was not changed to alanine. Translocation efficiencies were quantified with the colorimetric TMB (3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine) detection system employing horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Investigation of the six subset A variants identified position K556A as sterically important. The K556A substitution increases TMB diffusion from 15 to 97 [nM]/s and reaches nearly the TMB diffusion value of the unlabeled FhuA Delta1-160 (102 [nM]/s). The prominent role of position K556 is confirmed by the corresponding subset B variant which contains only the K556 lysine in the interior of the barrel. Pyridyl labeling of K556 reduces TMB translocation to 16 [nM]/s reaching nearly background levels in liposomes (13 [nM]/s). A first B-factor analysis based on MD simulations confirmed that position K556 is the least fluctuating lysine among the six in the channel interior of FhuA Delta1-160 and therefore well suited for controlling compound fluxes through steric hindrance.

CONCLUSIONS: A FhuA Delta1-160 based reduction triggered release system has been shown to control the compound flux by the presence of only one inner channel sterical hindrance based on 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionic-acid labeling (amino acid position K556). As a consequence, the release kinetic can be modulated by introducing an opportune number of hindrances. The FhuA Delta1-160 channel embedded in liposomes can be advanced to a universal and compound independent release system which allows a size selective compound release through rationally re-engineered channels.},

On the basis of DNA duplex lifetimes, the DNA-nanopores are able to discriminate between individual DNA strands up to 30 nucleotides in length differing by a single base substitution. This was exemplified by the detection of a drug resistance-conferring mutation in the reverse transcriptase gene of HIV.

abstract = {By modifying the surface of nanoporous alumina membranes using mixtures of a photochromic spiropyran and hydrophobic molecules, it is possible to control the admission of water into the membrane using light. When the spiropyran is in the thermally stable, relatively hydrophobic closed form, the membrane is not wet by an aqueous solution. Upon exposure to UV light, the spiropyran photoisomerizes to the more polar merocyanine form, allowing water to enter the pores and cross the membrane. Thus, the photosensitive membrane acts as a burst valve, allowing the transport of water and ions across the membrane. If the aqueous solution contains ions, then the membrane acts as an electrical switch; photoisomerization leads to a two-order-of-magnitude increase in ionic conductance, allowing a current to flow across the membrane. Exposure to visible light causes photoisomerization of the merocyanine back to the closed, spiro form, but dewetting of the membrane does not occur spontaneously, due to a high activation barrier.},

In the serotonin-bound structure, we observe hydrophilic interactions with loop E-binding site residues, which might enable transitions to channel opening. In the granisetron-bound structure, we observe a critical cation-$\pi$ interaction between the indazole moiety of the ligand and a cationic centre in loop D, which is uniquely present in the 5-HT(3) receptor. We use a series of chemically tuned granisetron analogues to demonstrate the energetic contribution of this electrostatic interaction to high-affinity ligand binding in the human 5-HT(3) receptor.

abstract = {Here, direct noninvasive neutron reflectivity measurements reveal the presence of a reduced (deuterated) water density region, with a sigmoidal density profile at the hydrophobic silane-water interface that depends on the type and concentration of dissolved gases in the water. Removal of dissolved gases decreases the width of the reduced water density region, and their reintroduction leads to its increase. When compared with recent computer simulations, a locally fluctuating density profile is proposed, whereas preexisting nanobubbles are excluded. The presence of a fluctuating reduced water density region between two hydrophobic surfaces and the attractive "depletion force" to which it leads may help explain the hydrophobic force and its reported diminution in deaerated water. Our results are also quantitatively consistent with recent dynamic surface force apparatus results that drastically revise previous estimates of the slip length of water flowing past hydrophobic surfaces from microns to approximately 20 nm. Our observations, therefore, go a long way toward reconciling three quite different types of experiments and phenomena: water depletion at hydrophobic surfaces, water slip at hydrophobic surfaces, and the hydrophobic interaction.},

abstract = {Inspired by ion channels in biological cells where the intracellular and extracellular ionic concentrations are typically different, a salt concentration gradient through a charged nanopore is proposed to actively regulate its ion transport and selectivity. Results obtained show that, in addition to the ion current rectification phenomenon, a reversed ion selectivity of the nanopore occurs when the concentration gradient is sufficiently large. In addition, if the directions of the applied concentration gradient and electric field are identical, a reversed magnified electric field occurs near the cathode side of the nanopore. This induced field can be used to enhance the capture rate of biomolecules and is therefore capable of improving the performance of single biomolecule sensing using nanopores.},

abstract = {Liquid-ordered phases are one of two biochemically active membrane states, which until now were thought to be a unique consequence of the interactions between eukaryotic membrane lipids. The formation of a liquid-ordered phase depends crucially on the ordering properties of sterols. However, it is not known whether this capacity exists in organisms that lack sterols, such as bacteria. We show that diplopterol, the simplest bacterial hopanoid, has similar properties and that hopanoids are bacterial “sterol surrogates” with the ability to order saturated lipids and to form a liquid-ordered phase in model membranes. These observations suggest that the evolution of an ordered biochemically active liquid membrane could have evolved before the oxygenation of Earth’s surface and the emergence of sterols.},

abstract = {Molecular transport in nanopores plays a central role in many emerging nanotechnologies for gas separation and storage, as well as in nanofluidics. Theories of the transport provide an understanding of the mechanisms that influence the transport and their interplay, and can lead to tractable models that can be used to advance these nanotechnologies through process analysis and optimisation. We review some of the most influential theories of fluid transport in small pores and confined spaces. Starting from the century old Knudsen formulation, the dusty gas model and several other related approaches that share a common point of departure in the Maxwell-Stefan diffusion equations are discussed. In particular, the conceptual basis of the models and the validity of the assumptions and simplifications necessary to obtain their final results are analysed. It is shown that the effect of adsorption is frequently either neglected, or treated on an ad hoc basis, such as through the division of the pore flux into gas-phase and surface diffusion contributions. Furthermore, while it is commonplace to assume that cross-sectional pressure is uniform, it is demonstrated that this violates the Gibbs-Duhem relation and that it is the chemical potential that essentially remains constant in the cross-section, as near-equilibrium density profiles are preserved even during transport. The Dusty Gas model and Maxwell-Stefan model for surface diffusion are analysed, and their strengths and weaknesses discussed, illustrating the use of conflicting choices of frames of reference in the former case, and the importance of assigning appropriate values for the binary diffusivity in the latter case. The oscillator model, developed in this laboratory, which is exact in the low density limit under diffuse reflection conditions, is shown to represent an advance on the classical Knudsen formula, although the latter frequently appears as a fundamental part of many transport models. The distributed friction model, also developed in this laboratory for the study of multi-component transport at any Knudsen number is discussed and compared with previous approaches. Finally, the outlook for theory and future research needs are discussed.},

abstract = {Electric fields promote pore formation in both biological and model membranes. We clamped unmodified planar bilayers at 150-550 mV to monitor transient single pores for a long period of time. We observed fast transitions between different conductance levels reflecting opening and closing of metastable lipid pores. Although mean lifetime of the pores was 3 +/- 0.8 ms (250 mV), some pores remained open for up to approximately 1 s. The mean amplitude of conductance fluctuations (approximately 500 pS) was independent of voltage and close for bilayers of different area (40,000 and 10 microm(2)), indicating the local nature of the conductive defects. The distribution of pore conductance was rather broad (dispersion of approximately 250 pS). Based on the conductance value and its dependence of the ion size, the radius of the average pore was estimated as approximately 1 nm. Short bursts of conductance spikes (opening and closing of pores) were often separated by periods of background conductance. Within the same burst the conductance between spikes was indistinguishable from the background. The mean time interval between spikes in the burst was much smaller than that between adjacent bursts. These data indicate that opening and closing of lipidic pores proceed through some electrically invisible (silent) pre-pores. Similar pre-pore defects and metastable conductive pores might be involved in remodeling of cell membranes in different biologically relevant processes.},

Our analysis suggests that the majority of the protein molecules were linear or looped during translocation and that the electrical forces present under physiologically relevant potentials can unfold proteins. Our results show that the nanopore translocation signals are sensitive enough to distinguish the folding state of a protein and distinguish between proteins based on the excluded volume of a local segment of the polypeptide chain that transiently stalls in the nanopore due to the primary sequence of charges.},

Specifically, we consider the cofactor binding fragment of CysB; the lysine/arginine/ornithine-binding protein (LAO); the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD); the ribose-binding protein (RBP); the N-terminal lobe of ovotransferrin in apo-form (apo-OVOT); and the leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein (LIVBP). All have domains that resemble a Rossmann fold, but there are also some significant differences. Results indicate that similar global dynamic behavior is preserved for the members of a fold family, and that differences usually occur in regions only where specific function is localized. The present work is a computational demonstration that the scaffold of a protein fold may be utilized for diverse purposes. LAO requires a bound ligand before it conforms to the large-scale fluctuation behavior of the three other members of the family, CysB, PBGD, and RBP, all of which contain a substrate (cofactor) at the active site cleft. The dynamics of the ligand-free enzymes LIVBP and apo-OVOT, on the other hand, concur with that of unliganded LAO. The present results suggest that it is possible to construct structure alignments based on dynamic fluctuation behavior.},

MscS, the mechanosensitive channel of small conductance, is found in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli and its crystallographic structure in an open form has been recently solved. By means of molecular dynamics simulations we studied the stability of the channel conformation suggested by crystallography in a fully solvated lipid (POPC) bilayer, the combined system encompassing 224,340 atoms. When restraining the backbone of the protein, the channel remained in the open form and the simulation revealed intermittent permeation of water molecules through the channel. Abolishing the restraints under constant pressure conditions led to spontaneous closure of the transmembrane channel, whereas abolishing the restraints when surface tension (20 dyn/cm) was applied led to channel widening. The large balloon-shaped cytoplasmic domain of MscS exhibited spontaneous diffusion of ions through its side openings. Interaction between the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic domain of MscS was observed and involved formation of salt bridges between residues Asp62 and Arg128; this interaction may be essential for the gating of MscS. K+ and Cl- ions showed distinctively different distributions in and around the channel.},

For these membranes the elastic area expansivity modulus increases from approximately 200 to 600 dyn/cm, and the tension at lysis increases from 5.7 to 13.2 dyn/cm, i.e., the membranes become more cohesive with increasing cholesterol content. The critical membrane voltage, Vc, required for breakdown was also found to increase with increasing cholesterol from 1.1 to 1.8 V at zero membrane tension. We have modeled the behavior in terms of the bilayer expansivity. Membrane area can be increased by either tensile or electrocompressive stresses. Both can store elastic energy in the membrane and eventually cause breakdown at a critical area dilation or critical energy. The model predicts a relation between tension and voltage at breakdown and this relation is verified experimentally for the three reconstituted membrane systems studied here.},

During the 1000ns simulation, the residues 1-27 were found to interact preferentially with the lipid-aqueous interface region while residues 28-42 show inclination to remain inside the bilayer hydrophobic tail region. The interaction between peptides and lipids has facilitated the association of A$\beta$ peptides. However, the interaction between cholesterol and peptides is inversely correlated with the extent of the peptide-peptide interactions. Our simulation has uncovered the formation of a short segment of parallel $\beta$-sheet between two peptide chains. In another chain, the N- and C-termini came close to each other. All the structural transitions indicate that our simulation has caught a glimpse of the complicated peptide oligomerization process. The full understanding of the underlying mechanism still requires further experimental and theoretical studies.},

Using these analogs, the Ins(1,4,5)P3 affinity media were also synthesized (Hirata, M., Watanabe, Y., Ishimatsu, T., Yanaga, F., Koga, T., and Ozaki, S. (1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 168, 379-386). When the cytosol fraction from the rat brain was applied to an Ins(1,4,5)P3 affinity column, an eluate with a 2 M NaCl solution was found to have remarkable Ins(1,4,5)P3-binding activity. The active fraction was further fractionated with gel filtration chromatography, and two proteins with an apparent molecular mass of 130 or 85 kDa were found to be Ins(1,4,5)P3-binding proteins but with no Ins(1,4,5)P3 metabolizing activities. Partial amino acid sequences determined after proteolysis and reversed-phase chromatography revealed that the protein with an apparent molecular mass of 85 kDa is the delta-isozyme of phospholipase C and that of 130 kDa has no sequence the same as the Ins(1,4,5)P3-recognizing proteins hitherto examined. Ins(1,4,5)P3 at concentrations greater than 1 microM strongly inhibited 85-kDa phospholipase C delta activity, without changing its dependence on the concentrations of free Ca2+ and H+. Among inositol phosphates examined, Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 inhibited the binding of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 to the 130-kDa protein at much the same concentrations as seen with Ins(1,4,5)P3. This report seems to be the first evidence for the presence of soluble Ins(1,4,5)P3-binding proteins in the rat brain, one of which is the delta isozyme of phospholipase C.},

The lateral tensions stretching the vesicle membrane are calculated from the Maxwell stress tensor and the eccentricity of the ellipsoid. The apparent increase of membrane area with tension, being due to a flattening of thermal undulations, permits us to determine the bending rigidities. We obtain 2.47×10-20 J for EYPC, 3.37×10-20 J for DLPC, 2.46×10-20 J for POPC, and 1.01×10-20 J for DGDG, with errors of up to 20%.

abstract = {The role of protein-bound water molecules in protein function and catalysis is an emerging topic. Here, we studied the solvation of an excess proton by protein-bound water molecules and the contribution of the surrounding amino acid residues at the proton release site of the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin. It hosts an excess proton within a protein-bound water cluster, which is hydrogen bonded to several surrounding amino acids. Indicative of delocalization is a broad continuum absorbance experimentally observed by time-resolved Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In combination with site-directed mutagenesis, the involvement of several amino acids (especially Glu-194 and Glu-204) in the delocalization was elaborated. Details regarding the contributions of the glutamates and water molecules to the delocalization mode in biomolecular simulations are controversial. We carried out quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) self-consistent charge density functional tight-binding simulations for all amino acids that have been experimentally shown to be involved in solvation of the excess proton, and systematically investigated the influence of the quantum box size. We compared calculated theoretical infrared spectra with experimental ones as a measure for the correct description of excess proton delocalization. A continuum absorbance can only be observed for small quantum boxes containing few amino acids and/or water molecules. Larger quantum boxes, including all experimentally shown involved amino acids, resulted in narrow absorbance bands, indicating protonation of a single binding site in contradiction to experimental results. We conclude that small quantum boxes seem to reproduce representative extreme cases of proton delocalization modes: proton delocalization only on water molecules or only between Glu-194 and Glu-204. Extending the experimental spectral region to lower wave numbers, a water-delocalized proton reproduces the observed continuum absorbance better than a glutamate-shared delocalized proton. However, a full agreement between QM simulations and experimental results on the delocalized excess proton will require a larger quantum box as well as more sophisticated QM/MM methods. © 2014 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Isolated, atomically thin conducting membranes of graphite, called graphene, have recently been the subject of intense research with the hope that practical applications in fields ranging from electronics to energy science will emerge. The atomic thinness, stability and electrical sensitivity of graphene motivated us to investigate the potential use of graphene membranes and graphene nanopores to characterize single molecules of DNA in ionic solution. Here we show that when immersed in an ionic solution, a layer of graphene becomes a new electrochemical structure that we call a trans-electrode. The trans-electrode's unique properties are the consequence of the atomic-scale proximity of its two opposing liquid-solid interfaces together with graphene's well known in-plane conductivity. We show that several trans-electrode properties are revealed by ionic conductance measurements on a graphene membrane that separates two aqueous ionic solutions. Although our membranes are only one to two atomic layers thick, we find they are remarkable ionic insulators with a very small stable conductance that depends on the ion species in solution. Electrical measurements on graphene membranes in which a single nanopore has been drilled show that the membrane's effective insulating thickness is less than one nanometre. This small effective thickness makes graphene an ideal substrate for very high resolution, high throughput nanopore-based single-molecule detectors. The sensitivity of graphene's in-plane electronic conductivity to its immediate surface environment and trans-membrane solution potentials will offer new insights into atomic surface processes and sensor development opportunities.},

abstract = {The theoretical prediction of water drying transitions near nonpolar surfaces has stimulated an intensive search for biological processes exploiting this extreme form of hydrophobicity. Here we quantitatively demonstrate that drying of a hydrophobic constriction is the major determinant of ion conductance in the GLIC pentameric ion channel. Molecular-dynamics simulations show that in the closed state, the channel conductance is ∼12 orders-of-magnitude lower than in the open state. This large drop in conductance is remarkable because even in the functionally closed conformation the pore constriction remains wide enough for the passage of sodium ions, aided by a continuous bridge of ∼12 water molecules. However, we find that the free energy cost of hydrating the hydrophobic gate is large, accounting almost entirely for the energetic barrier blocking ion passage. The free energies of transferring a sodium ion into a prehydrated gate in functionally closed and open states differ by only 1.2 kcal/mol, compared to an 11 kcal/mol difference in the costs of hydrating the hydrophobic gate. Conversely, ion desolvation effects play only minor roles in GLIC ion channel gating. Our simulations help rationalize experiments probing the gating kinetics of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in response to mutations of pore-lining residues. The molecular character and phase behavior of water should thus be included in quantitative descriptions of ion channel gating.},

Here we explore all plausible oligomeric arrangements of the PLH bundles within homomeric ion channels by building models using generic restraints. In particular, the distance between two neighbouring PLHs was bounded both below and above in order to avoid steric clash and allow proper packing. The resulting models provide a theoretical representation of the accessible space for oligomeric arrangements. While the represented space is confined, it encompasses nearly all the ion channel PLH bundles for which the structures are currently known. For a multitude of channels, gating models suggested by paths within the confined accessible space are in qualitative agreement with those established in previous structural and computational studies.},

We study the interaction of such water chains with homogeneous electric fields for finite closed and infinite periodically replicated tubes. By evaluating the grand-canonical partition function term-by-term, we show that homogeneous electric fields favor the filling of previously empty nanotubes with water from the bulk phase. A two-state description of the collective water dipole orientation in the nanotube provides an excellent approximation for the dependence of the water-chain polarization and the filling equilibrium on the electric field. The energy and entropy contributions to the free energy of filling the nanotube were determined from the temperature dependence of the occupancy probabilities. We find that the energy of transfer depends sensitively on the water-tube interaction potential, and that the entropy of one-dimensionally ordered water chains is comparable to that of bulk water. We also discuss implications for proton transfer reactions in biology.},

Free energy profiles for ion transport through the pores show that energy barriers depend on pore size and ion properties and that there are three key regimes that affect transport. The first is where the ion can fit in the pore with its full inner hydration shell, the second is where the pore size is between the bare ion and hydrated radius, and the third is where the ion size approaches that of the pore. Energy barriers in the first regime are relatively small and due to rearrangement of the inner hydration shell and/or displacement of further hydration shells. Energy barriers in the second regime are due to partial dehydration and are larger than barriers seen in the first regime. In the third regime, the pore becomes too small for bare ions to fit regardless of hydration and thus energy barriers are very high. In the second regime where partial dehydration controls transport, the trend in the slopes of the change in energy barrier with pore size corresponds to the hydration strength of the anions.},

Comparing between lipids with acyl chains and methyl branched chains and between lipids with ether and ester linkages, which change drastically the membrane dipole potential, we found that in both cases the electroporation threshold differed substantially. We show, for the first time, that the electroporation threshold of a lipid bilayer depends not only on the "electrical" properties of the membrane, i.e., its dipole potential, but also on the properties of its component hydrophobic tails.},

abstract = {Protegrin peptides are potent antimicrobial agents believed to act against a variety of pathogens by forming nonselective transmembrane pores in the bacterial cell membrane. We have employed 3D Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) calculations to determine the steady-state ion conduction characteristics of such pores at applied voltages in the range of -100 to +100 mV in 0.1 M KCl bath solutions. We have tested a variety of pore structures extracted from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on an experimentally proposed octomeric pore structure. The computed single-channel conductance values were in the range of 290-680 pS. Better agreement with the experimental range of 40-360 pS was obtained using structures from the last 40 ns of the MD simulation, where conductance values range from 280 to 430 pS. We observed no significant variation of the conductance with applied voltage in any of the structures that we tested, suggesting that the voltage dependence observed experimentally is a result of voltage-dependent channel formation rather than an inherent feature of the open pore structure. We have found the pore to be highly selective for anions, with anionic to cationic current ratios (I(Cl-)/I(K+)) on the order of 10(3). This is consistent with the highly cationic nature of the pore but surprisingly in disagreement with the experimental finding of only slight anionic selectivity. We have additionally tested the sensitivity of our PNP model to several parameters and found the ion diffusion coefficients to have a significant influence on conductance characteristics. The best agreement with experimental data was obtained using a diffusion coefficient for each ion set to 10% of the bulk literature value everywhere inside the channel, a scaling used by several other studies employing PNP calculations. Overall, this work presents a useful link between previous work focused on the structure of protegrin pores and experimental efforts aimed at investigating their conductance characteristics.},

abstract = {Evidence has accumulated that the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), located on the outer membrane of mitochondria, plays a central role in apoptosis. The involvement of VDAC oligomerization in apoptosis has been suggested in various studies. However, it still remains unknown how exactly VDAC supramolecular assembly can be regulated in the membrane. This study addresses the role of lipids in this process. We investigate the effect of cardiolipin (CL) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), anionic lipids important for mitochondria metabolism and apoptosis, on VDAC oligomerization. By applying fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy to VDAC reconstituted into giant unilamellar vesicles, we demonstrate that PG significantly enhances VDAC oligomerization in the membrane, whereas cardiolipin disrupts VDAC supramolecular assemblies. During apoptosis, the level of PG in mitochondria increases, whereas the CL level decreases. We suggest that the specific lipid composition of the outer mitochondrial membrane might be of crucial relevance and, thus, a potential cue for regulating the oligomeric state of VDAC.},

abstract = {Association of DNA molecules with lipid bilayer membranes is of considerable interest for a large variety of applications in biotechnology. Here we introduce syringomycin E (SRE), a small pore-forming lipopeptide produced by the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae, as a facile sensor for the detection of DNA interactions with lipid membranes. SRE forms highly reproducible pores in cellular and artificial membranes. The pore structure involves bilayer lipids, which have a pronounced influence on open channel conductance and gating. SRE channels act as ionic diodes that serve as current rectifiers sensitive to the charge of the bilayer. We employ this intrinsic property to electronically monitor the association of DNA molecules with the membrane in a variety of different settings. We show that SRE can be used for quantitatively probing electrostatic interactions of DNA and DNA-cholesterol conjugates with a lipid membrane. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SRE channels allow monitoring of hybridization reactions between lipid-anchored probe strands and complementary strands in solution. In the presence of double-stranded DNA, SRE channels display a particularly high degree of rectification. Finally, the formation of multilayered structures assembled from poly-(L)-lysine and DNA oligonucleotides on the membrane was precisely monitored with SRE.},

However, despite the apparently open nature of the inner pore in the TWIK-1 (K2P1/KCNK1) crystal structure, the reasons underlying its low levels of functional activity remain unclear. In this study, we use a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and functional validation to demonstrate that TWIK-1 possesses a hydrophobic barrier deep within the inner pore, and that stochastic dewetting of this hydrophobic constriction acts as a major barrier to ion conduction. These results not only provide an important insight into the mechanisms which control TWIK-1 channel activity, but also have important implications for our understanding of how ion permeation may be controlled in similar ion channels and pores.},

abstract = {$\beta$-barrel membrane proteins play an important role in controlling the exchange and transport of ions and organic molecules across bacterial and mitochondrial outer membranes. They are also major regulators of apoptosis and are important determinants of bacterial virulence. In contrast to $\beta$-helical membrane proteins, their evolutionary pattern of residue substitutions has not been quantified, and there are no scoring matrices appropriate for their detection through sequence alignment. Using a Bayesian Monte Carlo estimator, we have calculated the instantaneous substitution rates of transmembrane domains of bacterial $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins. The scoring matrices constructed from the estimated rates, called bbTM for $\beta$-barrel Transmembrane Matrices, improve significantly the sensitivity in detecting homologs of $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins, while avoiding erroneous selection of both soluble proteins and other membrane proteins of similar composition. The estimated evolutionary patterns are general and can detect $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins very remote from those used for substitution rate estimation. Furthermore, despite the separation of 2-3 billion years since the proto-mitochondrion entered the proto-eukaryotic cell, mitochondria outer membrane proteins in eukaryotes can also be detected accurately using these scoring matrices derived from bacteria. This is consistent with the suggestion that there is no eukaryote-specific signals for translocation. With these matrices, remote homologs of $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins with known structures can be reliably detected at genome scale, allowing construction of high quality structural models of their transmembrane domains, at the rate of 131 structures per template protein. The scoring matrices will be useful for identification, classification, and functional inference of membrane proteins from genome and metagenome sequencing projects. The estimated substitution pattern will also help to identify key elements important for the structural and functional integrity of $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins, and will aid in the design of mutagenesis studies.},

To avoid this phenomenon, superhydrophobic surfaces must show robustness to high pressure. Otherwise, an external energy has to be applied to dewet the droplet from the structuration. We present, in this article, an original approach to actuate liquid droplets via a modulated EWOSS signal (MEWOSS). This technique allows the dewetting of the droplet due to periodic vibrations induced by the electrowetting actuation. In that case, it is possible to investigate a larger range of superhydrophobic surfaces under EWOSS without droplet impalement. Three different superhydrophobic surfaces, showing different degrees of impalement under EWOSS, are investigated and compared using this MEWOSS technique.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium that utilizes substrate-specific outer membrane (OM) proteins for the uptake of small, water-soluble nutrients employed in the growth and function of the cell. In this paper, we present for the first time a comprehensive single-channel examination of seven members of the OM carboxylate channel K (OccK) subfamily. Recent biochemical, functional, and structural characterization of the OccK proteins revealed their common features, such as a closely related, monomeric, 18-stranded $\beta$-barrel conformation with a kidney-shaped transmembrane pore and the presence of a basic ladder within the channel lumen. Here, we report that the OccK proteins exhibited fairly distinct unitary conductance values, in a much broader range than previously expected, which includes low ($\sim$40-100 pS) and medium ($\sim$100-380 pS) conductance. These proteins showed diverse single-channel dynamics of current gating transitions, revealing one-open substate (OccK3), two-open substate (OccK4-OccK6), and three-open substate (OccK1, OccK2, and OccK7) kinetics with functionally distinct conformations. Interestingly, we discovered that anion selectivity is a conserved trait among the members of the OccK subfamily, confirming the presence of a net pool of positively charged residues within their central constriction. Moreover, these results are in accord with an increased specificity and selectivity of these protein channels for negatively charged, carboxylate-containing substrates. Our findings might ignite future functional examinations and full atomistic computational studies for unraveling a mechanistic understanding of the passage of small molecules across the lumen of substrate-specific, $\beta$-barrel OM proteins.},

Various potential applications using these nanopores have been reported at the proof-of-principle stage, with the eventual aim of using them as an alternative to de novo DNA sequencing. Currently, there have been two general approaches to prepare nanopores for nucleic acid analysis: organic nanopores, such as alpha-hemolysin pores, are commonly used for DNA analysis, whereas synthetic solid-state nanopores have also been developed using various conventional and non-conventional fabrication techniques. In particular, synthetic nanopores with pore sizes smaller than the alpha-hemolysin pores have been prepared, primarily by electron-beam-assisted techniques: these are more robust and have better dimensional adjustability. This review will examine current methods of nanopore preparation, ranging from organic pore preparations to recent developments in synthetic nanopore fabrications.},

Hopefully over the next decade, more detailed molecular structures of entire Cys-loop receptors in drug-bound and drug-free conformations will become available. These, together with functional studies, will provide a clear picture of how these receptors participate in neurotransmission and how structural variations between receptor subtypes impart their unique characteristics. This insight should facilitate the design of novel and improved therapeutics to treat neurological disorders.

abstract = {Resonance energy transfer between 4-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD) acyl chain labeled phospholipid analogues and (lissamine) rhodamine B labeled phosphatidylethanolamine was used to monitor the rate of NBD-labeled lipid transfer between a variety of small unilamellar donor vesicles and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) acceptor vesicles. In the presence of appropriate concentrations of Ca2+ and phosphate, the transfer rate of NBD-phosphatidylserine (NBD-PS) from vesicles composed of lipid extracts from human red blood cells was reduced by approximately 10-fold, while the transfer rates of NBD-phosphatidylcholine, -ethanolamine, -glycerol, -N-succinylethanolamine, and -phosphatidic acid were essentially unaffected. A systematic evaluation of the lipid composition needed to facilitate the Ca2+/phosphate-induced inhibition of NBD-PS transfer revealed that the process was dependent upon the inclusion of both cholesterol and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the donor vesicle population. Inhibition of NBD-PS transfer required the sequential addition of phosphate and Ca2+ to the vesicles, indicating that the combined interaction of Ca2+ and phosphate at the membrane surface was a prerequisite for inhibition to occur. Parallel experiments designed to determine the possible mechanism of this phenomenon showed that inhibition of NBD-PS transfer was not due to Ca2+-mediated phase separations or vesicle-vesicle fusion. However, the addition of Ca2+ and phosphate to vesicles composed of total red blood cell lipids or cholesterol/PE did result in their aggregation. On the other hand, aggregation per se did not seem to be responsible for the inhibition of transfer since NBD-PS-containing vesicles composed of DOPC or DOPC/DOPE also aggregated, although NBD-PS transfer was unaffected.},

The intrusion, which takes place above the bulk saturation pressure, can be well described using a macroscopic capillary model. Once the material is saturated with water, extrusion takes place upon reduction of the externally applied pressure. Our results for the extrusion pressure can only be understood by assuming that the limiting extrusion mechanism is the nucleation of a vapor bubble inside the pores. A comparison of calculated and experimental nucleation pressures shows that a proper inclusion of line tension effects is necessary to account for the observed values of nucleation barriers. Negative line tensions of order 10(-11) J m(-1) are found for our system, in reasonable agreement with other experimental estimates of this quantity.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations were used to refine a theoretical model that describes the interaction of single polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules with $\alpha$-hemolysin ($\alpha$HL) nanopores. The simulations support the underlying assumptions of the model, that PEG decreases the pore conductance by binding cations (which reduces the number of mobile ions in the pore) and by volume exclusion, and provide bounds for fits to new experimental data. Estimation of cation binding indicates that four monomers coordinate a single K(+) in a crown-ether-like structure, with, on average, 1.5 cations bound to a PEG 29-mer at a bulk electrolyte concentration of 4 M KCl. Additionally, PEG is more cylindrical and has a larger cross-section area in the pore than in solution, although its volume is similar. Two key experimental quantities of PEG are described by the model: the ratio of single channel current in the presence of PEG to that in the polymer's absence (blockade depth) and the mean residence time of PEG in the pore. The refined theoretical model is simultaneously fit to the experimentally determined current blockade depth and the mean residence times for PEGs with 15 to 45 monomers, at applied transmembrane potentials of -40 to -80 mV and for three electrolyte concentrations. The model estimates the free energy of the PEG-cation complexes to be -5.3 kBT. Finally the entropic penalty of confining PEG to the pore is found to be inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration.},

abstract = {Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations are performed to study the adsorption of water in single-walled (6:6), (8:8), (10:10), (12:12), and (20:20) carbon nanotubes in the 248-548 K temperature range. At room temperature the resulting adsorption isotherms in (10:10) and wider single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNs) are characterized by negligible water uptake at low pressures, sudden and complete pore filling once a threshold pressure is reached, and wide adsorption/desorption hysteresis loops. The width of the hysteresis loops decreases as pore diameter narrows and it becomes negligible for water adsorption in (8:8) and (6:6) SWCNs. Results for the isosteric heat of adsorption, density profiles along the pore axis and across the pore radii, order parameter across the pore radii, and x-ray diffraction patterns are presented. Layered structures are observed when the internal diameter of the nanotubes is commensurate to the establishment of a hydrogen-bonded network. The structure of water in (8:8) and (10:10) SWCNs is ordered when the temperature is 298 and 248 K, respectively. By simulating adsorption isotherms at various temperatures, the hysteresis critical temperature, e.g., the lowest temperature at which no hysteresis can be detected, is determined for water adsorbed in (20:20), (12:12), and (10:10) SWCNs. The hysteresis critical temperature is lower than the vapor-liquid critical temperature for bulk Simple Point Charge-Extended (SPCE) water model.},

abstract = {GLIC is a homopentameric proton-gated, prokaryotic homologue of the Cys loop receptor family of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. Recently, crystal structures of GLIC hypothesized to represent an open channel state were published. To explore the channel structure in functional GLIC channels, we tested the ability of p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate to react with 30 individual cysteine substitution mutants in and flanking the M2 channel-lining segment in the closed state (pH 7.5) and in a submaximally activated state (pH 5.0). Nine mutants did not tolerate cysteine substitution and were not functional. From positions 10' to 27', p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate significantly modified the currents at pH 7.5 and 5.0 in all mutants except H234C (11'), I235C (12'), V241C (18'), T243C (20'), L245C (22'), and Y250C (27'), which were not functional, except for 12'. Currents for P246C (23') and K247C (24') were only significantly altered at pH 5.0. The reaction rates were all >1000 m(-1) s(-1). The reactive residues were more accessible in the activated than in the resting state. We infer that M2 is tightly associated with the adjacent transmembrane helices at the intracellular end but is more loosely packed from 10' to the extracellular end than the x-ray structures suggest. We infer that the charge selectivity filter is in the cytoplasmic half of the channel. We also show that below pH 5.0, GLIC desensitizes on a time scale of minutes and infer that the crystal structures may represent a desensitized state.},

abstract = {The importance of nanomotors in nanotechnology is akin to that of mechanical engines to daily life. The AAA+ superfamily is a class of nanomotors performing various functions. Their hexagonal arrangement facilitates bottom-up assembly for stable structures. The bacteriophage phi29 DNA translocation motor contains three coaxial rings: a dodecamer channel, a hexameric ATPase ring, and a hexameric pRNA ring. The viral DNA packaging motor has been believed to be a rotational machine. However, we discovered a revolution mechanism without rotation. By analogy, the earth revolves around the sun while rotating on its own axis. One-way traffic of dsDNA translocation is facilitated by five factors: (1) ATPase changes its conformation to revolve dsDNA within a hexameric channel in one direction; (2) the 30° tilt of the channel subunits causes an antiparallel arrangement between two helices of dsDNA and channel wall to advance one-way translocation; (3) unidirectional flow property of the internal channel loops serves as a ratchet valve to prevent reversal; (4) 5'-3' single-direction movement of one DNA strand along the channel wall ensures single direction; and (5) four electropositive layers interact with one strand of the electronegative dsDNA phosphate backbone, resulting in four relaying transitional pauses during translocation. The discovery of a riding system along one strand provides a motion nanosystem for cargo transportation and a tool for studying force generation without coiling, friction, and torque. The revolution of dsDNA among 12 subunits offers a series of recognition sites on the DNA backbone to provide additional spatial variables for nucleotide discrimination for sensing applications.},

abstract = {A practical approach that enables one to calculate the standard free energy of binding from a one-dimensional potential of mean force (PMF) is proposed. Umbrella sampling and the weighted histogram analysis method are used to generate a PMF along the reaction coordinate of binding. At each point, a restraint is applied orthogonal to the reaction coordinate to make possible the determination of the volume sampled by the ligand. The free energy of binding from an arbitrary unbound volume to the restrained bound form is calculated from the ratio of the PMF integrated over the bound region to that of the unbound. Adding the free energy changes from the standard-state volume to the unbound volume and from the restrained to the unrestrained bound state gives the standard free energy of binding. Exploration of the best choice of binding paths is also made. This approach is first demonstrated on a model binding system and then tested on the benzamidine−trypsin system for which reasonable agreement with experiment is found. A comparison is made with other methods to obtain the standard free energy of binding from the PMF.},

Hopefully over the next decade, more detailed molecular structures of entire Cys-loop receptors in drug-bound and drug-free conformations will become available. These, together with functional studies, will provide a clear picture of how these receptors participate in neurotransmission and how structural variations between receptor subtypes impart their unique characteristics. This insight should facilitate the design of novel and improved therapeutics to treat neurological disorders.

These modifications are heavily involved in transcriptional repression, gene regulation, development and the progression of diseases including cancer. We report a new single-molecule assay for the detection of DNA methylation using solid-state nanopores. Methylation is detected by selectively labeling methylation sites with MBD1 (MBD-1x) proteins, the complex inducing a 3 fold increase in ionic blockage current relative to unmethylated DNA. Furthermore, the discrimination of methylated and unmethylated DNA is demonstrated in the presence of only a single bound protein, thereby giving a resolution of a single methylated CpG dinucleotide. The extent of methylation of a target molecule could also be coarsely quantified using this novel approach. This nanopore-based methylation sensitive assay circumvents the need for bisulfite conversion, fluorescent labeling, and PCR and could therefore prove very useful in studying the role of epigenetics in human disease.},

Serotonin also activates ion channels directly, suggesting that it may also mediate rapid, excitatory responses. A complementary DNA clone containing the coding sequence of one of these rapidly responding channels, a 5HT3 subtype of the serotonin receptor, has been isolated by screening a neuroblastoma expression library for functional expression of serotonin-gated currents in Xenopus oocytes. The predicted protein product has many of the features shared by other members of the ligand-gated ion channel family. The pharmacological and electrophysiological characteristics of the cloned receptor are largely consistent with the properties of native 5HT3 receptors. Messenger RNA encoding this receptor is found in the brain, spinal cord, and heart. This receptor defines a new class of excitatory ligand-gated channels.},

abstract = {Among ion channels, only the nicotinic-receptor superfamily has evolved to generate both cation- and anion-selective members. Although other, structurally unrelated, neurotransmitter-gated cation channels exist, no other type of neurotransmitter-gated anion channel, and thus no other source of fast synaptic inhibitory signals, has been described so far. In addition to the seemingly straightforward electrostatic effect of the presence (in the cation-selective members) or absence (in the anion-selective ones) of a ring of pore-facing carboxylates, mutational studies have identified other features of the amino-acid sequence near the intracellular end of the pore-lining transmembrane segments (M2) that are also required to achieve the high charge selectivity shown by native channels. However, the mechanism underlying this more subtle effect has remained elusive and a subject of speculation. Here we show, using single-channel electrophysiological recordings to estimate the protonation state of native ionizable side chains, that anion-selective-type sequences favour whereas cation-selective-type sequences prevent the protonation of the conserved, buried basic residues at the intracellular entrance of the pore (the M2 0' position). We conclude that the previously unrecognized tunable charge state of the 0' ring of buried basic side chains is an essential feature of these channels' versatile charge-selectivity filter.},

abstract = {Phox homology (PX) domains, which have been identified in a variety of proteins involved in cell signaling and membrane trafficking, have been shown to interact with phosphoinositides (PIs) with different affinities and specificities. To elucidate the structural origin of the diverse PI specificity of PX domains, we determined the crystal structure of the PX domain from Bem1p that has been reported to bind phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P). We also measured the membrane binding properties of the PX domain and its mutants by surface plasmon resonance and monolayer techniques and calculated the electrostatic potentials for the PX domain in the absence and presence of bound PtdIns(4)P. The Bem1p PX domain contains a signature PI-binding site optimized for PtdIns(4)P binding and also harbors basic and hydrophobic residues on the membrane-binding surface. The membrane binding of the Bem1p PX domain is initiated by nonspecific electrostatic interactions between the cationic membrane-binding surface of the domain and anionic membrane surfaces, followed by the membrane penetration of hydrophobic residues. Unlike other PX domains, the Bem1p PX domain has high intrinsic membrane penetrating activity in the absence of PtdIns(4)P, suggesting that the partial membrane penetration may occur before specific PtdIns(4)P binding and last after the removal of PtdIns(4)P under certain conditions. This structural and functional study of the PtdIns(4)P-binding Bem1p PX domain provides new insight into the diverse PI specificities and membrane-binding mechanisms of PX domains.},

The OpdK structure reveals a monomeric, 18-stranded ?? barrel with a kidney-shaped central pore. The OpdK pore constriction is relatively wide for a substrate-specific channel (???8 ?? diameter), and it is lined by a positively charged patch of arginine residues on one side and an electronegative pocket on the opposite side-features likely to be important for substrate selection. Single-channel electrical recordings of OpdK show binding of vanillate to the channel, and they suggest that OpdK forms labile trimers in the outer membrane. Comparison of the OpdK structure with that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa OprD provides the first qualitative insights into the different substrate specificities of these closely related channels. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Ion channels gate at membrane-embedded domains by changing their conformation along the ion-conduction pathway. Inward rectifier K(+) (Kir) channels possess a unique extra-membrane cytoplasmic domain that extends this pathway. However, the relevance and contribution of this domain to ion permeation remain unclear. By qualitative X-ray crystallographic analysis, we found that the pore in the cytoplasmic domain of Kir3.2 binds cations in a valency-dependent manner, and does not allow the displacement of Mg(2+) by monovalent cations or spermine. Electrophysiological analyses revealed that the cytoplasmic pore of Kir3.2 selectively binds positively charged molecules, and has a higher affinity for Mg(2+) when it has a low probability of being open. The selective blocking of chemical modification of the side chain of pore-facing residues by Mg(2+) indicates that the mode of binding of Mg(2+) is likely to be similar to that observed in the crystal structure. These results indicate that the Kir3.2 crystal structure has a closed conformation with a negative electrostatic field potential at the cytoplasmic pore, the potential of which may be controlled by conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain to regulate ion diffusion along the pore.},

The resultant nanotubes have modifiable surfaces and inner pores of a uniform diameter defined by the constituent macrocycles. The self-assembling hydrophobic nanopores can mediate not only highly selective transmembrane ion transport, unprecedented for a synthetic nanopore, but also highly efficient transmembrane water permeability.

abstract = {The proton-gated ion channel from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC) is a prokaryotic homolog of the eukaryotic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that responds to the binding of neurotransmitter acetylcholine and mediates fast signal transmission. Recent emergence of a high-resolution crystal structure of GLIC captured in a potentially open state allowed detailed, atomiclevel insight into ion conduction and selectivity mechanisms in these channels. Herein, we have examined the barriers to ion conduction and origins of ion selectivity in the GLIC channel by the construction of potential-of-mean-force profiles for sodium and chloride ions inside the transmembrane region. Our calculations reveal that the GLIC channel is open for a sodium ion to transport, but presents a ???11 kcal/mol free energy barrier for a chloride ion. Our collective findings identify three distinct contributions to the observed preference for the permeant ions. First, there is a substantial contribution due to a ring of negatively charged glutamate residues (E-2') at the narrow intracellular end of the channel. The negative electrostatics of this region and the ability of the glutamate side chains to directly bind cations would strongly favor the passage of sodium ions while hindering translocation of chloride ions. Second, our results imply a significant hydrophobic contribution to selectivity linked to differences in the desolvation penalty for the sodium versus chloride ions in the central hydrophobic region of the pore. This hydrophobic contribution is evidenced by the large free energy barriers experienced by Cr in the middle of the pore for both GLIC and the E-2'A mutant. Finally, there is a distinct contribution arising from the overall negative electrostatics of the channel. ?? 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

@article{Tasneem2005a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acetylcholine receptor type ligand-gated ion channels (ART-LGIC; also known as Cys-loop receptors) are a superfamily of proteins that include the receptors for major neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, serotonin, glycine, GABA, glutamate and histamine, and for Zn2+ ions. They play a central role in fast synaptic signaling in animal nervous systems and so far have not been found outside of the Metazoa. RESULTS: Using sensitive sequence-profile searches we have identified homologs of ART-LGICs in several bacteria and a single archaeal genus, Methanosarcina. The homology between the animal receptors and the prokaryotic homologs spans the entire length of the former, including both the ligand-binding and channel-forming transmembrane domains. A sequence-structure analysis using the structure of Lymnaea stagnalis acetylcholine-binding protein and the newly detected prokaryotic versions indicates the presence of at least one aromatic residue in the ligand-binding boxes of almost all representatives of the superfamily. Investigation of the domain architectures of the bacterial forms shows that they may often show fusions with other small-molecule-binding domains, such as the periplasmic binding protein superfamily I (PBP-I), Cache and MCP-N domains. Some of the bacterial forms also occur in predicted operons with the genes of the PBP-II superfamily and the Cache domains. Analysis of phyletic patterns suggests that the ART-LGICs are currently absent in all other eukaryotic lineages except animals. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis and conserved sequence motifs also suggest that a subset of the bacterial forms is closer to the metazoan forms. CONCLUSIONS: From the information from the bacterial forms we infer that cation-pi or hydrophobic interactions with the ligand are likely to be a pervasive feature of the entire superfamily, even though the individual residues involved in the process may vary. The conservation pattern in the channel-forming transmembrane domains also suggests similar channel-gating mechanisms in the prokaryotic versions. From the distribution of charged residues in the prokaryotic M2 transmembrane segments, we expect that there will be examples of both cation and anion selectivity within the prokaryotic members. Contextual connections suggest that the prokaryotic forms may function as chemotactic receptors for low molecular weight solutes. The phyletic patterns and phylogenetic relationships suggest the possibility that the metazoan receptors emerged through an early lateral transfer from a prokaryotic source, before the divergence of extant metazoan lineages.},

abstract = {The quantitative experimental uncertainty in the structure of fully hydrated, biologically relevant, fluid (L$\alpha$) phase lipid bilayers has been too large to provide a firm base for applications or for comparison with simulations. Many structural methods are reviewed including modern liquid crystallography of lipid bilayers that deals with the fully developed undulation fluctuations that occur in the L$\alpha$ phase. These fluctuations degrade the higher order diffraction data in a way that, if unrecognized, leads to erroneous conclusions regarding bilayer structure. Diffraction measurements at high instrumental resolution provide a measure of these fluctuations. In addition to providing better structural determination, this opens a new window on interactions between bilayers, so the experimental determination of interbilayer interaction parameters is reviewed briefly. We introduce a new structural correction based on fluctuations that has not been included in any previous studies. Updated measurements, such as for the area compressibility modulus, are used to provide adjustments to many of the literature values of structural quantities. Since the gel (L$\beta$′) phase is valuable as a stepping stone for obtaining fluid phase results, a brief review is given of the lower temperature phases. The uncertainty in structural results for lipid bilayers is being reduced and best current values are provided for bilayers of five lipids.},

Here we present the X-ray structure at 2.9 A resolution of the bacterial Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel homologue (GLIC) at pH 4.6 in an apparently open conformation. This cationic channel is known to be permanently activated by protons. The structure is arranged as a funnel-shaped transmembrane pore widely open on the outer side and lined by hydrophobic residues. On the inner side, a 5 A constriction matches with rings of hydrophilic residues that are likely to contribute to the ionic selectivity. Structural comparison with ELIC, a bacterial homologue from Erwinia chrysanthemi solved in a presumed closed conformation, shows a wider pore where the narrow hydrophobic constriction found in ELIC is removed. Comparative analysis of GLIC and ELIC reveals, in concert, a rotation of each extracellular beta-sandwich domain as a rigid body, interface rearrangements, and a reorganization of the transmembrane domain, involving a tilt of the M2 and M3 alpha-helices away from the pore axis. These data are consistent with a model of pore opening based on both quaternary twist and tertiary deformation.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) play a central role in intercellular communication in the nervous system and are involved in fundamental processes such as attention, learning, and memory. They are oligomeric protein assemblies that convert a chemical signal into an ion flux through the postsynaptic membrane, but the molecular mechanism of gating ions has remained elusive. Here, we present atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the prokaryotic channels from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC) and Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC), whose crystal structures are thought to represent the active and the resting states of pLGICs, respectively, and of the eukaryotic glutamate-gated chloride channel from Caenorhabditis elegans (GluCl), whose open-channel structure was determined complexed with the positive allosteric modulator ivermectin. Structural observables extracted from the trajectories of GLIC and ELIC are used as progress variables to analyze the time evolution of GluCl, which was simulated in the absence of ivermectin starting from the structure with bound ivermectin. The trajectory of GluCl with ivermectin removed shows a sequence of structural events that couple agonist unbinding from the extracellular domain to ion-pore closing in the transmembrane domain. Based on these results, we propose a structural mechanism for the allosteric communication leading to deactivation/activation of the GluCl channel. This model of gating emphasizes the coupling between the quaternary twisting and the opening/closing of the ion pore and is likely to apply to other members of the pLGIC family.},

abstract = {The spontaneous filling of hydrophobic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by water observed both experimentally and from simulations is counterintuitive because confinement is generally expected to decrease both entropy and bonding, and remains largely unexplained. Here we report the entropy, enthalpy, and free energy extracted from molecular dynamics simulations of water confined in CNTs from 0.8 to 2.7-nm diameters. We find for all sizes that water inside the CNTs is more stable than in the bulk, but the nature of the favorable confinement of water changes dramatically with CNT diameter. Thus we find (i) an entropy (both rotational and translational) stabilized, vapor-like phase of water for small CNTs (0.8-1.0 nm), (ii) an enthalpy stabilized, ice-like phase for medium-sized CNTs (1.1-1.2 nm), and (iii) a bulk-like liquid phase for tubes larger than 1.4 nm, stabilized by the increased translational entropy as the waters sample a larger configurational space. Simulations with structureless coarse-grained water models further reveal that the observed free energies and sequence of transitions arise from the tetrahedral structure of liquid water. These results offer a broad theoretical basis for understanding water transport through CNTs and other nanostructures important in nanofluidics, nanofiltrations, and desalination.},

abstract = {Cell membranes are constitutively composed of thousands of different lipidic species, whose specific organization leads to functional heterogeneities. In particular, sphingolipids, cholesterol and some proteins associate among them to form stable nanoscale domains involved in recognition, signaling, membrane trafficking, etc. Atomic-detail information in the nanometer/second scale is still elusive to experimental techniques. In this context, molecular simulations on membrane systems have provided useful insights contributing to bridge this gap. Here we present the results of a series of simulations of biomembranes representing non-raft and raft-like nano-sized domains in order to analyze the particular structural and dynamical properties of these domains. Our results indicate that the smallest (5 nm) raft domains are able to preserve their distinctive structural and dynamical features, such as an increased thickness, higher ordering, lower lateral diffusion, and specific lipid-ion interactions. The insertion of a transmembrane protein helix into non-raft, extended raft-like, and raft-like nanodomain environments result in markedly different protein orientations, highlighting the interplay between the lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions.},

abstract = {The permeation of hydrophobic, cylindrical nanopores by water molecules and ions is investigated under equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium conditions by extensive molecular-dynamics simulations. Neglecting the chemical structure of the confining pore surface, we focus on the effects of pore radius and electric field on permeation. The simulations confirm the intermittent filling of the pore by water, reported earlier under equilibrium conditions for pore radii larger than a critical radius R(c). Below this radius, water can still permeate the pore under the action of a strong electric field generated by an ion concentration imbalance at both ends of the pore embedded in a structureless membrane. The water driven into the channel undergoes considerable electrostriction characterized by a mean density up to twice the bulk density and by a dramatic drop in dielectric permittivity which can be traced back to a considerable distortion of the hydrogen-bond network inside the pore. The free-energy barrier to ion permeation is estimated by a variant of umbrella sampling for Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+), and Cl(-) ions, and correlates well with known solvation free energies in bulk water. Starting from an initial imbalance in ion concentration, equilibrium is gradually restored by successive ion passages through the water-filled pore. At each passage the electric field across the pore drops, reducing the initial electrostriction, until the pore, of radius less than R(c), closes to water and hence to ion transport, thus providing a possible mechanism for voltage-dependent gating of hydrophobic pores.},

abstract = {We show that narrow hydrophobic pores have an intrinsic ion selectivity by using single-walled carbon nanotube membranes as a model. We examined pores of radius 3.4-6.1 A, and conducted molecular dynamics simulations to show that Na+, K+, and Cl- face different free energy barriers when entering hydrophobic pores. Most of the differences result from the different dehydration energies of the ions; however, changes in the solvation shell structure in the confined nanotube interior and van der Waals interactions in the small tubes can both play a role. Molecular dynamics simulations conducted under hydrostatic pressure show that carbon nanotube membranes can act as ion sieves, with the pore radius and pressure determining which ions will permeate through the membrane. This work suggests that the intrinsic ion selectivity of biological pores of differing radii might also play a role in determining their selectivity, in addition to the more common explanations based on electrostatic effects. In addition, "hydrophobic gating" can arise in continuous water-filled pores.},

In the presence of appropriate concentrations of Ca2+ and phosphate, the transfer rate of NBD-phosphatidylserine (NBD-PS) from vesicles composed of lipid extracts from human red blood cells was reduced by approximately 10-fold, while the transfer rates of NBD-phosphatidylcholine, -ethanolamine, -glycerol, -N-succinylethanolamine, and -phosphatidic acid were essentially unaffected. A systematic evaluation of the lipid composition needed to facilitate the Ca2+/phosphate-induced inhibition of NBD-PS transfer revealed that the process was dependent upon the inclusion of both cholesterol and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the donor vesicle population. Inhibition of NBD-PS transfer required the sequential addition of phosphate and Ca2+ to the vesicles, indicating that the combined interaction of Ca2+ and phosphate at the membrane surface was a prerequisite for inhibition to occur. Parallel experiments designed to determine the possible mechanism of this phenomenon showed that inhibition of NBD-PS transfer was not due to Ca2+-mediated phase separations or vesicle-vesicle fusion. However, the addition of Ca2+ and phosphate to vesicles composed of total red blood cell lipids or cholesterol/PE did result in their aggregation. On the other hand, aggregation per se did not seem to be responsible for the inhibition of transfer since NBD-PS-containing vesicles composed of DOPC or DOPC/DOPE also aggregated, although NBD-PS transfer was unaffected.},

The desired industrial goal is often difficult to achieve using the native form of the enzyme. Recent developments in protein engineering have revolutionized the development of commercially available enzymes into better industrial catalysts. Protein engineering aims at modifying the sequence of a protein, and hence its structure, to create enzymes with improved functional properties such as stability, specific activity, inhibition by reaction products, and selectivity towards non-natural substrates. Soluble enzymes are often immobilized onto solid insoluble supports to be reused in continuous processes and to facilitate the economical recovery of the enzyme after the reaction without any significant loss to its biochemical properties. Immobilization confers considerable stability towards temperature variations and organic solvents. Multipoint and multisubunit covalent attachments of enzymes on appropriately functionalized supports via linkers provide rigidity to the immobilized enzyme structure, ultimately resulting in improved enzyme stability. Protein engineering and immobilization techniques are sequential and compatible approaches for the improvement of enzyme properties. The present review highlights and summarizes various studies that have aimed to improve the biochemical properties of industrially significant enzymes.},

abstract = {Capsular polysaccharides form the outermost protective layer around many Gram-negative bacteria. Antibiotics aimed directly at weakening this layer are not yet available. In pathogenic Escherichia coli E69, a protein, Wza, forms a pore in the outer membrane that transports K30 capsular polysaccharide from its site of synthesis to the outside of the cell. This therefore represents a prospective antibiotic target. Here we test a variety of grommet-like mimics of K30 capsular polysaccharide on wild-type Wza and on mutant open forms of the pore by electrical recording in planar lipid bilayers. The most effective glycomimetic was the unnatural cyclic octasaccharide octakis(6-deoxy-6-amino)cyclomaltooctaose (am8$\gamma$CD), which blocks the $\alpha$-helix barrel of Wza, a site that is directly accessible from the external medium. This glycomimetic inhibited K30 polysaccharide transport in live E. coli E69. With the protective outer membrane disrupted, the bacteria can be recognized and killed by the human immune system.},

abstract = {The transmembrane domain of Klebsiella pneumoniae OmpA (KpOmpA) possesses four long extracellular loops that exhibit substantial sequence variability throughout OmpA homologs in Enterobacteria, in comparison with the highly conserved membrane-embedded $\beta$-barrel core. These loops are responsible for the immunological properties of the protein, including cellular and humoral recognition. In addition to key features revealed by structural elucidation of the KpOmpA transmembrane domain in detergent micelles, studies of protein dynamics provide insight into its function and/or mechanism of action. We have investigated the dynamics of KpOmpA in a lipid bilayer, using magic angle spinning solid-state NMR. The dynamics of the $\beta$-barrel and loop regions were probed by the spin-lattice relaxation times of the C($\alpha$) and C($\beta$) atoms of the serine and threonine residues, and by cross-polarization dynamics. The $\beta$-barrel core of the protein is rigid; the C-terminal halves of two of the four extracellular loops (L1 and L3), which are particularly long in KpOmpA, are highly mobile. The other two loops (L2 and L4), which are very similar to their homologs in Escherichia coli OmpA, and the N-terminal halves of L1 and L3 exhibit more restricted motions. We suggest a correlation between the sequence variability and the dynamics of certain loop regions, which accounts for their respective contributions to the structural and immunological properties of the protein.},

In our study, we have examined the nature of the highly charged helix-turn-helix motif (S3b and S4) to address how a highly charged peptide is stabilized within a bilayer in the presence of various transmembrane electrical potentials. Our double-bilayer simulation results show how the variation of the salt concentrations between the inner and outer bath establishes a transmembrane potential. Our results also show that important features of the peptide affected by changes in electrical potential are the center of mass depth, the swivel/kink degrees of conformation, and the hydrogen-bonding patterns. As the voltage gradient across the bilayer increased, the center of mass of the peptide shifted in a direction toward the outer bath. The peptide also has a higher percent helical content and the swivel/kink conformation is more rigid for nonpolarized systems where no voltage drop occurred between salt baths. Our results also provide some suggestions for how this domain may be affected by environmental changes as part of the voltage sensor in a K-channel.},

abstract = {Hydrogen bonding is of great importance in chemistry and biology (for general reviews see Pimental and McClellan, 1960; Huggins, 1971; Schuster et al., 1976). First suggested more than 60 years ago (by M. L. Huggins, in 1919), it was soon appreciated that such an interaction would be of importance in peptide and protein structures. This only became widely accepted and recognised, however, following the classic proposal by Linus Pauling of the $\sim$t-helix (Pauling et al., 1951) and parallel and antiparallel fl-pleated sheet (Pauling and Corey, 1951) configurations. The two structures are of prime importance, as they have been shown, through many protein structure determinations, to provide elements of regular structure (secondary structure) in almost all globular proteins. Further it is believed that the formation of hydrogen-bonded nuclei, in the form of cooperatively-interacting helices and/or elements of fl-structure, is critical to the folding of the polypeptide chain into its final, detailed structure (e.g. Anfinsen, 1972; Nagano, 1974; Lim, 1978).},

Our calculations predict the existence of at least three different pathways for the nucleation of droplets and bubbles in these confined fluids: axisymmetric annular bumps and lenses, and asymmetric droplets. The morphological transition between these different structures is driven by the existence of states of zero compressibility in the capillary. We show that the classical capillarity theory provides surprisingly accurate predictions for the work of formation of critical nuclei in cylindrical pores when line tension contributions to the free energy are taken into account.},

Membrane damage was demonstrated by the lysis of erythrocytes and protoplasts, the leakage of intracellular contents, the loss of the ability of Escherichia coli to plasmolyze in a hypertonic medium and the release of $\beta$-galactosidase activity in a permease-negative mutant of E. coli. In a suspension of Staphylococcus aureus the number of cells killed by an electric field correlated with the number that could not be converted to spheroplasts.2.2. Spores of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus polymyxa were resistant to electric field strengths up to 30 kV cm. The development of sensitivity during germination and outgrowth was due to the emergence of the vegetative cell from the protection afforded by the spore coat and cortex layers.3.3. The d.c.-pulse treatment caused loss of motility and synthesis of the induced enzyme $\beta$-galactosidase in vegetative bacteria, but no inhibitions were demonstrated with a number of isolated enzyme activities.4.4. It is proposed that the electric field causes an irreversible loss of the membrane's function as the semipermeable barrier between the bacterial cell and its environment, and that this is the cause of cell death.},

abstract = {The potassium channel from Streptomyces lividans is an integral membrane protein with sequence similarity to all known K+ channels, particularly in the pore region. X-ray analysis with data to 3.2 angstroms reveals that four identical subunits create an inverted teepee, or cone, cradling the selectivity filter of the pore in its outer end. The narrow selectivity filter is only 12 angstroms long, whereas the remainder of the pore is wider and lined with hydrophobic amino acids. A large water-filled cavity and helix dipoles are positioned so as to overcome electrostatic destabilization of an ion in the pore at the center of the bilayer. Main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms from the K+ channel signature sequence line the selectivity filter, which is held open by structural constraints to coordinate K+ ions but not smaller Na+ ions. The selectivity filter contains two K+ ions about 7.5 angstroms apart. This configuration promotes ion conduction by exploiting electrostatic repulsive forces to overcome attractive forces between K+ ions and the selectivity filter. The architecture of the pore establishes the physical principles underlying selective K+ conduction.},

abstract = {During experiments aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which long-chain carbon molecules are formed in interstellar space and circumstellar shells1, graphite has been vaporized by laser irradiation, producing a remarkably stable cluster consisting of 60 carbon atoms. Concerning the question of what kind of 60-carbon atom structure might give rise to a superstable species, we suggest a truncated icosahedron, a polygon with 60 vertices and 32 faces, 12 of which are pentagonal and 20 hexagonal. This object is commonly encountered as the football shown in Fig. 1. The C60 molecule which results when a carbon atom is placed at each vertex of this structure has all valences satisfied by two single bonds and one double bond, has many resonance structures, and appears to be aromatic.},

abstract = {The outer membrane protects Gram-negative bacteria against a harsh environment. At the same time, the embedded proteins fulfil a number of tasks that are crucial to the bacterial cell, such as solute and protein translocation, as well as signal transduction. Unlike membrane proteins from all other sources, integral outer membrane proteins do not consist of transmembrane alpha-helices, but instead fold into antiparallel beta-barrels. Over recent years, the atomic structures of several outer membrane proteins, belonging to six families, have been determined. They include the OmpA membrane domain, the OmpX protein, phospholipase A, general porins (OmpF, PhoE), substrate-specific porins (LamB, ScrY) and the TonB-dependent iron siderophore transporters FhuA and FepA. These crystallographic studies have yielded invaluable insight into and decisively advanced the understanding of the functions of these intriguing proteins. Our review is aimed at discussing their common principles and peculiarities as well as open questions associated with them.},

First suggested more than 60 years ago (by M. L. Huggins, in 1919), it was soon appreciated that such an interaction would be of importance in peptide and protein structures. This only became widely accepted and recognised, however, following the classic proposal by Linus Pauling of the $\sim$t-helix (Pauling et al., 1951) and parallel and antiparallel fl-pleated sheet (Pauling and Corey, 1951) configurations. The two structures are of prime importance, as they have been shown, through many protein structure determinations, to provide elements of regular structure (secondary structure) in almost all globular proteins. Further it is believed that the formation of hydrogen-bonded nuclei, in the form of cooperatively-interacting helices and/or elements of fl-structure, is critical to the folding of the polypeptide chain into its final, detailed structure (e.g. Anfinsen, 1972; Nagano, 1974; Lim, 1978).},

To investigate electroporation as a delivery method in cardiac tissue, embryonic chick hearts were studied for uptake of propidium iodide (PI) or DNA encoding either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase following electrical shock. PI uptake increased monotonically from 6% of heart tissue after 3 shocks to 77% with 12 shocks. GFP and luciferase expression varied in proportion to shock number, with detectable levels in all electrically treated hearts. Thus, electroporation promotes uptake of PI and DNA in cardiac tissue, suggesting further application of this method for therapeutic genes.

When transiting a nanopore, the highly negatively charged DNA interacts with a nanopore both electrically and hydrodynamically, causing a current blockage or a current enhancement at different ion concentrations. This effect was previously characterized using a phenomenological model that can be considered as the limit of the electro-hydrodynamics model presented here. We show theoretically that the effect of surface charge of a nanopore (or electro-osmotic effect) can be equivalently treated as modifications of electrophoretic mobilities of ions in the pore, providing an improved physical understanding of the current blockage (or enhancement).},

The shearing stress between the nanotube wall and the water molecules is identified as a key factor in determining the nanofluidic properties. Due to the effect of nanoscale confinement, the effective shearing stress is not only size sensitive but also strongly dependent on the fluid flow rate. Consequently, the nominal viscosity of the confined water decreases rapidly as the tube radius is reduced or when a faster flow rate is maintained. An infiltration experiment on a nanoporous carbon is performed to qualitatively validate these findings.},

abstract = {An invertebrate glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) has recently been crystallized in an open-pore state. This channel is homologous to the human Cys-loop receptor family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, including anion-selective GlyR and GABAR and cation-selective nAChR and 5HT(3). We implemented molecular dynamics (MD) in conjunction with an elastic network model to perturb the X-ray structure of GluCl and investigated the open channel stability and its ion permeation characteristics. Our study suggests that TM2 helical tilting may close GluCl near the hydrophobic constriction L254 (L9'), similar to its cation-selective homologues. Ion permeation characteristics were determined by Brownian dynamics simulations using a hybrid MD/continuum electrostatics approach to evaluate the free energy profiles for ion transport. Near the selectivity filter region (P243 or P-2'), the free energy barrier for Na(+) transport is over 4 k(B)T higher than that for Cl(-), indicating anion selectivity of the channel. Furthermore, three layers of positivity charged rings in the extracellular domain also contribute to charge selectivity and facilitate Cl(-) permeability over Na(+). Collectively, the charge selectivity of GluCl may be determined by overall electrostatic and ion dehydration effects, perhaps not deriving from a single region of the channel (the selectivity filter region near the intracellular entrance).},

abstract = {The X-ray structure of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) has recently provided structural insight into this family of ion channels at high resolution. The structure shows a homo-pentameric protein with a barrel-stave architecture that defines an ion-conduction pore located on the fivefold axis of symmetry. In this structure, the wide aqueous vestibule that is encircled by the extracellular ligand-binding domains of the five subunits narrows to a discontinuous pore that spans the lipid bilayer. The pore is constricted by bulky hydrophobic residues towards the extracellular side, which probably serve as barriers that prevent the diffusion of ions. This interrupted pore architecture in ELIC thus depicts a non-conducting conformation of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel, the thermodynamically stable state in the absence of bound ligand. As ligand binding promotes pore opening in these ion channels and the specific ligand for ELIC has not yet been identified, we have turned our attention towards a homologous protein from the cyanobacterium Gloebacter violaceus (GLIC). GLIC was shown to form proton-gated channels that are activated by a pH decrease on the extracellular side and that do not desensitize after activation. Both prokaryotic proteins, ELIC and GLIC form ion channels that are selective for cations over anions with poor discrimination among monovalent cations, characteristics that resemble the conduction properties of the cation-selective branch of the family that includes acetylcholine and serotonin receptors. Here we present the X-ray structure of GLIC at 3.1 A resolution. The structure reveals a conformation of the channel that is distinct from ELIC and that probably resembles the open state. In combination, both structures suggest a novel gating mechanism for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels where channel opening proceeds by a change in the tilt of the pore-forming helices.},

abstract = {This article describes the software suite GROMACS (Groningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) that was developed at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, in the early 1990s. The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License. It is maintained by a group of developers from the Universities of Groningen, Uppsala, and Stockholm, and the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz. Its Web site is http://www.gromacs.org.},

abstract = {The determinants of single channel conductance ($\gamma$) and ion selectivity within eukaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channels have traditionally been ascribed to amino acid residues within the second transmembrane domain and flanking sequences of their component subunits. However, recent evidence suggests that $\gamma$ is additionally controlled by residues within the intracellular and extracellular domains. We examined the influence of two anionic residues (Asp(113) and Asp(127)) within the extracellular vestibule of a high conductance human mutant 5-hydroxytryptamine type-3A (5-HT(3)A) receptor (5-HT(3)A(QDA)) upon $\gamma$, modulation of the latter by extracellular Ca(2+), and the permeability of Ca(2+) with respect to Cs(+) (P(Ca)/P(Cs)). Mutations neutralizing (Asp → Asn), or reversing (Asp → Lys), charge at the 113 locus decreased inward $\gamma$ by 46 and 58%, respectively, but outward currents were unaffected. The D127N mutation decreased inward $\gamma$ by 82% and also suppressed outward currents, whereas the D127K mutation caused loss of observable single channel currents. The forgoing mutations, except for D127K, which could not be evaluated, ameliorated suppression of inwardly directed single channel currents by extracellular Ca(2+). The P(Ca)/P(Cs) of 3.8 previously reported for the 5-HT(3)A(QDA) construct was reduced to 0.13 and 0.06 by the D127N and D127K mutations, respectively, with lesser, but clearly significant, effects caused by the D113N (1.04) and D113K (0.60) substitutions. Charge selectivity between monovalent cations and anions (P(Na)/P(Cl)) was unaffected by any of the mutations examined. The data identify two key residues in the extracellular vestibule of the 5-HT(3)A receptor that markedly influence $\gamma$, P(Ca)/P(Cs), and additionally the suppression of $\gamma$ by Ca(2+).},

To demonstrate the sensitivity and selectivity of example devices, we computed the probability distribution PX($\beta$) of the quantity $\beta$ representing the change in the logarithmic current through the pore due to the presence of a nucleobase X (X = adenine, thymine, guanine, or cytosine). We quantified the selectivity of the bilayer-graphene nanopores by showing that PX($\beta$) exhibits distinct peaks for each base X. To demonstrate that such discriminating sensing is a general feature of bilayer nanopores, the well-separated positions of these peaks were shown to be present for different pores, with alternative examples of electrical contacts.},

abstract = {We introduce two new computer models in which the influence of the finite potential mesh is, for most practical purposes, eliminated. The Quiet Particle-Mesh model (QPM) uses a Gaussian-shaped charge cloud and careful shaping of the potential solution in either real or transform space. The QPM model is measured to be 150 times less noisy than the conventional CIC model and is suitable for large collisionless plasma simulations with 105 or more particles. This is achieved at little or no cost in computing time. The hybrid Particle-Particle/Particle-Mesh model (PPPM), on the other hand, adds to the above mesh calculation contributions from nearby particles by direct summation. This model has a spatial resolution which is independent of the mesh spacing and may be a small fraction of a mesh cell. It is more time-consuming and is suitable for high-resolution sub-Debye length investigations with a smaller number of particles (∼104). Applied to molecular dynamics, the PPPM model can simulate systems with approximately 100 times the number of particles than conventional methods.},

@article{Benz1980,
abstract = {Charge-pulse experiments were performed on artificial lipid bilayer membranes with charging times in the range between 10 ns and 10 [mu]s. If the membranes are charged to voltages in the order of 100 mV, the membrane voltage at the end of the charge pulse is a linear function of the injected charge. However, if the membranes are charged to voltages in the range of 1 V, this relationship no longer holds and a reversible high conductance state occurs. This state is defined as an electrical breakdown and it does not allow the membranes to charge to higher voltages than the breakdown voltage, Vc. Between charging times of 300 ns and 5 [mu]s at 25�C and between 100 ns and 2 [mu]s at 40�C, Vc showed a strong dependence on the charging time of the membrane and decreased from 1.2 to 0.5 V (25�C) and from 1 to 0.4 V (40�C). For other charging times below and above these ranges, the breakdown voltage seemed to be constant. The results indicate that the breakdown phenomenon occurs in less than 10 ns. The pulse-length dependence of the breakdown voltage is consistent with the interpretation of the electrical breakdown mechanism in terms of the electromechanical model. However, it seems possible that below a charging time of the membrane of 300 ns (25�C) and 100 ns (40�C) other processes (such as the Born energy) become possible.},

abstract = {The 5-HT3 receptor is a neurotransmitter-gated ion channel. It is a member of the Cys-loop family of receptors, which also includes nicotinic acetylcholine, glycine and GABAA receptors. Each member of the family consists of an arrangement of five subunits surrounding a central ion-conducting pore. The 5-HT3 receptor binding site is composed of six loops from two adjacent subunits, and the critical ligand binding residues within these loops are well documented. There are a range of 5-HT3 receptor agonists and competitive antagonists, but it is the antagonists that dominate their clinical use. Studies have proposed a range of disease symptoms that might be amenable to 5-HT3 receptor selective compounds; however, so far only the treatment of emesis and irritable bowel syndrome have been fully realised. In this review, the authors look at the structure, function and distribution of 5-HT3 receptors and how this may influence their role in disease. The authors also describe the existing clinical applications of 5-HT3 antagonists and the future potential of these drugs.},

Available optogenetic proteins that directly move ions to achieve silencing are inefficient, pumping only a single ion per photon across the cell membrane rather than allowing many ions per photon to flow through a channel pore. Building on high-resolution crystal-structure analysis, pore vestibule modeling, and structure-guided protein engineering, we designed and characterized a class of channelrhodopsins (originally cation-conducting) converted into chloride-conducting anion channels. These tools enable fast optical inhibition of action potentials and can be engineered to display step-function kinetics for stable inhibition, outlasting light pulses and for orders-of-magnitude-greater light sensitivity of inhibited cells. The resulting family of proteins defines an approach to more physiological, efficient, and sensitive optogenetic inhibition.},

abstract = {RDL receptors are GABA-activated inhibitory Cys-loop receptors found throughout the insect CNS. They are a key target for insecticides. Here, we characterize the GABA binding site in RDL receptors using computational and electrophysiological techniques. A homology model of the extracellular domain of RDL was generated and GABA docked into the binding site. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted critical GABA binding interactions with aromatic residues F206, Y254, and Y109 and hydrophilic residues E204, S176, R111, R166, S176, and T251. These residues were mutated, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and their functions assessed using electrophysiology. The data support the binding mechanism provided by the simulations, which predict that GABA forms many interactions with binding site residues, the most significant of which are cation-$\pi$ interactions with F206 and Y254, H-bonds with E204, S205, R111, S176, T251, and ionic interactions with R111 and E204. These findings clarify the roles of a range of residues in binding GABA in the RDL receptor, and also show that molecular dynamics simulations are a useful tool to identify specific interactions in Cys-loop receptors. © 2012 Biophysical Society.},

However, limited functional data exist for the GluCl receptors. Before applying the structural insights from GluCl to mammalian Cys-loop receptors such as nicotinic acetylcholine and GABA receptors, it is important to ensure that established functional features of mammalian Cys-loop receptors are present in the more distantly related GluCl receptors. Here, we seek to identify ligand-binding interactions that are generally associated with Cys-loop receptors, including the frequently observed cation-$\pi$ interaction. Our studies were performed on the highly homologous GluCl$\beta$ receptor, because GluCl$\alpha$is not activated by glutamate in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Mutagenesis of the signal peptide and pore lining helix was performed to enhance functional expression and sensitivity to applied ligand, respectively. Conventional and unnatural amino acid mutagenesis indicate a strong cation-$\pi$ interaction between Y206 and the protonated amine of glutamate, as well as other important ionic and hydrogen bond interactions between the ligand and the binding site, consistent with the crystal structure.},

abstract = {Recently, cyclodextrins were shown to act as adapters for the pore-forming protein staphylococcal .alpha.-hemolysin (.alpha.HL). The bagel-shaped mols. bind in the lumen of the transmembrane channel formed by .alpha.HL and alter the properties of the pore. For example, the unitary conductance is reduced, and org. mols. can act as channel blockers by binding to the cavity within the cyclodextrin adapter. In a search for a class of adapters more versatile than the cyclodextrins and amenable to prepn. as libraries, cyclic peptides have now been examd. Four peptides, cyclo[(L-Arg-D-Leu)4-] ((RL)4), cyclo[(L-Glu-D-Leu)4-] ((EL)4), cyclo[(-L-Phe-D-N-(aminoethyl)-Ala-L-Phe-D-Ala)2-] (diNH3+-(FA)4), and cyclo[(-L-Phe-D-N-(carboxymethyl)-Ala-L-Phe-D-Ala)2-] (diCO2--(FA)4), became lodged within the .alpha.HL pore, altering the unitary conductance and ion selectivity. Further, the pos. charged peptides, (RL)4 and diNH3+-(FA)4, were able to act as binding sites for various small polyanions. For example, the second messenger IP3 bound to (RL)4 within the .alpha.HL pore. Therefore, the modulation of single-channel currents through pores contg. cyclic peptide adapters may prove useful for sensing a variety of mols.},

It begins with a brief history of soft nanotechnology. This history has followed a path involving a gradual shift from the promise of revolutionary electronics, nanorobotics, and other futuristic concepts, to the realization of evolutionary improvements in the technology for current challenges in information technology, medicine, and sustainability. Soft nanoscience is an area that is occupied principally by chemists, and is in many ways indistinguishable from "nanochemistry". The paper identifies the natural tendency of its practitioners--exemplified by the speakers at this Faraday Discussion--to focus on synthesis and structure, rather than on function and application, of nanostructures. Soft nanotechnology has the potential to apply to a wide variety of large-scale applied (information technology, healthcare cost reduction, sustainability, energy) and fundamental (molecular biochemistry, cell biology, charge transport in organic matter) problems.},

abstract = {Charge-pulse experiments were performed on artificial lipid bilayer membranes with charging times in the range between 10 ns and 10 [mu]s. If the membranes are charged to voltages in the order of 100 mV, the membrane voltage at the end of the charge pulse is a linear function of the injected charge. However, if the membranes are charged to voltages in the range of 1 V, this relationship no longer holds and a reversible high conductance state occurs. This state is defined as an electrical breakdown and it does not allow the membranes to charge to higher voltages than the breakdown voltage, Vc. Between charging times of 300 ns and 5 [mu]s at 25�C and between 100 ns and 2 [mu]s at 40�C, Vc showed a strong dependence on the charging time of the membrane and decreased from 1.2 to 0.5 V (25�C) and from 1 to 0.4 V (40�C). For other charging times below and above these ranges, the breakdown voltage seemed to be constant. The results indicate that the breakdown phenomenon occurs in less than 10 ns. The pulse-length dependence of the breakdown voltage is consistent with the interpretation of the electrical breakdown mechanism in terms of the electromechanical model. However, it seems possible that below a charging time of the membrane of 300 ns (25�C) and 100 ns (40�C) other processes (such as the Born energy) become possible.},

Notable examples include alpha-hemolysin protein nanopores in lipid membranes and solid-state nanopores in Si3N4. Here we report a new technique for fabricating silicon oxide nanopores with single-nanometre precision and direct visual feedback, using state-of-the-art silicon technology and transmission electron microscopy. First, a pore of 20 nm is opened in a silicon membrane by using electron-beam lithography and anisotropic etching. After thermal oxidation, the pore can be reduced to a single-nanometre when it is exposed to a high-energy electron beam. This fluidizes the silicon oxide leading to a shrinking of the small hole due to surface tension. When the electron beam is switched off, the material quenches and retains its shape. This technique dramatically increases the level of control in the fabrication of a wide range of nanodevices.},

The atoms to be pulled have been chosen to closely match the conditions of a previous experimental study by atomic force spectroscopy. The temporal evolution of the distance between different couples of atoms of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds and of the unbinding force have been analyzed for the various setups and by applying seven different pulling speed values. The observed variability in the response of the system has been traced back to the occurrence of different pathways during the unbinding process. Furthermore, an analysis of the unbinding force as a function of the pulling speed analyzed in the framework of the thermally activated model has allowed the extraction of the dissociation rate constant at equilibrium. These results have been discussed in connection with the transient character of the system and with the available experimental data by atomic force spectroscopy.},

The mean lifetime of the membranes is measured as a function of the membrane potential difference. The distribution functions for the membrane lifetime are obtained for various values of the applied voltage. A qualitative interpretation of the breakdown phenomenon is proposed, which is based upon the concept of structural defects of the type of throughgoing pores, whose development is favoured by the electric field. These pores are analogous to the nuclei in the theory of new phase formation.\nThe elucidation of the mechanism of BLM breakdown in the electricfield may provide an important tool for studying the electric breakdown of biological membranes and possibly the nature of background conductivity of membranes.},

These methods are grouped into two broad categories-mapping methods, which use information from one scale of representation to parameterize a lower resolution model, and bridging methods, which repeatedly connect different scales during simulation-and we provide examples of both classes at different levels of complexity. Collectively, these models illustrate the numerous approaches to information transfer between scales and demonstrate that the complexity required of the model depends in general on the nature of the information sought.},

abstract = {The outer membrane protein Wza, from Escherichia coli K30, forms an octameric complex that is essential for capsular polysaccharide export. Homologs of Wza are widespread in gram-negative bacterial pathogens where capsules are critical virulence determinants. Wza is unusual in that it spans the outer membrane using a barrel composed of amphipathic alpha-helices, rather than being a beta-barrel like almost all other outer membrane channels. The transmembrane helical barrel of Wza also forms the external opening to a hydrophilic translocation pathway that spans the periplasm. Here, we have probed the structure and function of the Wza complex using both cryo-electron microscopy and mutagenesis. The helical barrel structure is stable in detergent micelles under mildly acidic conditions but is destabilized at basic pH, although the overall quaternary structure is retained. Truncation of the C-terminal region that forms the helical barrel by 4 residues has no effect on the ability of Wza to oligomerize and support capsule export, but larger truncations of 18, 24 or 35 amino acids abolish its function. The bulk of the C-terminal domain is essential for the stability and assembly of the E. coli Wza complex.},

abstract = {Narrow hydrophobic regions are a common feature of biological channels, with possible roles in ion-channel gating. We study the principles that govern ion transport through narrow hydrophobic membrane pores by molecular dynamics simulation of model membranes formed of hexagonally packed carbon nanotubes. We focus on the factors that determine the energetics of ion translocation through such nonpolar nanopores and compare the resulting free-energy barriers for pores with different diameters corresponding to the gating regions in closed and open forms of potassium channels. Our model system also allows us to compare the results from molecular dynamics simulations directly to continuum electrostatics calculations. Both simulations and continuum calculations show that subnanometer wide pores pose a huge free-energy barrier for ions, but a small increase in the pore diameter to approximately 1 nm nearly eliminates that barrier. We also find that in those wider channels the ion mobility is comparable to that in the bulk phase. By calculating local electrostatic potentials, we show that the long range Coulomb interactions of ions are strongly screened in the wide water-filled channels. Whereas continuum calculations capture the overall energetics reasonably well, the local water structure, which is not accounted for in this model, leads to interesting effects such as the preference of hydrated ions to move along the pore wall rather than through the center of the pore.},

abstract = {The thermal conductivity of composites of carbon nanotubes and polyamide-6,6 has been investigated using reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in a full atomistic resolution. It is found, in line with experiments, that the composites have thermal conductivities, which are only moderately larger than that of pure polyamide. The composite conductivities are orders of magnitude less than what would be expected from naïve additivity arguments. This means that the intrinsic thermal conductivities of isolated nanotubes, which exceed the best-conducting metals, cannot be harnessed for heat transport, when the nanotubes are embedded in a polymer matrix. The main reason is the high interfacial thermal resistance between the nanotubes and the polymer, which was calculated in addition to the total composite thermal conductivity as well as that of the subsystem. It hinders heat to be transferred from the slow-conducting polymer into the fast-conducting nanotubes and back into the polymer. This interpretation is in line with the majority of recent simulation works. An alternative explanation, namely, the damping of the long-wavelength phonons in nanotubes by the polymer matrix is not supported by the present calculations. These modes provide most of the polymers heat conduction. An additional minor effect is caused by the anisotropic structure of the polymer phase induced by the nearby nanotube surfaces. The thermal conductivity of the polymer matrix increases slightly in the direction parallel to the nanotubes, whereas it decreases perpendicular to it.},

Recently, we redesigned ferric hydroxamate uptake component A (FhuA), a 22-??-stranded protein containing an N-terminal 160-residue cork domain (C). The cork domain and four large extracellular loops (4L) were deleted to obtain an unusually stiff engineered FhuA ??C/??4L nanopore. We employed water-soluble poly(ethylene glycols) and dextran polymers to examine the interior of FhuA ??C/??4L. When this nanopore was reconstituted into a synthetic planar lipid bilayer, addition of poly(ethylene glycols) produced modifications in the single-channel conductance, allowing for the evaluation of the nanopore diameter. Here, we report that FhuA ??C/??4L features an approximate conical internal geometry with the cis entrance smaller than the trans entrance, in accord with the asymmetric nature of the crystal structure of the wild-type FhuA protein. Further experiments with impermeable dextran polymers indicated an average internal diameter of ???2.4 nm, a conclusion we arrived at based upon the polymer-induced alteration of the access resistance contribution to the nanopore's total resistance. Molecular insights inferred from this work represent a platform for future protein engineering of FhuA that will be employed for specific tasks in biotechnological applications. ?? 2012 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Nanopores that approach molecular dimensions demonstrate exotic transport behaviour and are theoretically predicted to display discontinuities in the diameter dependence of interior ion transport because of structuring of the internal fluid. No experimental study has been able to probe this diameter dependence in the 0.5-2 nm diameter regime. Here we observe a surprising fivefold enhancement of stochastic ion transport rates for single-walled carbon nanotube centered at a diameter of approximately 1.6 nm. An electrochemical transport model informed from literature simulations is used to understand the phenomenon. We also observe rates that scale with cation type as Li(+)>K(+)>Cs(+)>Na(+) and pore blocking extent as K(+)>Cs(+)>Na(+)>Li(+) potentially reflecting changes in hydration shell size. Across several ion types, the pore-blocking current and inverse dwell time are shown to scale linearly at low electric field. This work opens up new avenues in the study of transport effects at the nanoscale.},

abstract = {The authors present a new molecular dynamics algorithm for sampling the canonical distribution. In this approach the velocities of all the particles are rescaled by a properly chosen random factor. The algorithm is formally justified and it is shown that, in spite of its stochastic nature, a quantity can still be defined that remains constant during the evolution. In numerical applications this quantity can be used to measure the accuracy of the sampling. The authors illustrate the properties of this new method on Lennard-Jones and TIP4P water models in the solid and liquid phases. Its performance is excellent and largely independent of the thermostat parameter also with regard to the dynamic properties.},

abstract = {Channel gating and proton conductance of the influenza A virus M2 channel result from complex pH-dependent interactions involving the pore-lining residues His37, Trp41, and Asp44. Protons diffusing from the outside of the virus protonate His37, which opens the Trp41 gate and allows one or more protons to move into the virus interior. The Trp41 gate gives rise to a strong asymmetry in the conductance, favoring rapid proton flux only when the outside is at acid pH. Here, we show that the proton currents recorded for mutants of Asp44, including D44N found in the A/FPV/Rostock/34 strain, lose this asymmetry. Moreover, NMR and MD simulations show that the mutations induce a conformational change similar to that induced by protonation of His37 at low pH, and decrease the structural stability of the hydrophobic seal associated with the Trp41 gate. Thus, Asp44 is able to determine two important properties of the M2 proton channel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Development of a high-throughput nanopore-based biosensor requires multiplexing of nanopore measurements. Electrical detection, however, poses a challenge, as each nanopore circuit must be electrically independent, which requires complex nanofluidics and embedded electrodes. Here, we present an optical method for simultaneous measurements of the ionic current across an array of solid-state nanopores, requiring no additional fabrication steps. Proof-of-principle experiments are conducted that show simultaneous optical detection and characterization of ssDNA and dsDNA using an array of pores. Through a comparison with electrical measurements, we show that optical measurements are capable of accessing equivalent transmembrane current information.},

abstract = {Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations are used to study the adsorption of water in single-walled (10:10), (12:12), and (20:20) carbon nanotubes at 298 K. Water is represented by the extended simple point charge model and the carbon atoms as Lennard-Jones spheres. The nanotubes are decorated with different amounts of oxygenated sites, represented as carbonyl groups. In the absence of carbonyl groups the simulated isotherms are characterized by negligible amounts of water uptake at low pressures, sudden and complete pore filling once a threshold pressure is reached, and wide adsorption-desorption hysteresis loops. In the presence of a few carbonyl groups the simulated adsorption isotherms are characterized by pore filling at lower pressures and by narrower adsorption-desorption hysteresis loops compared to the results obtained in the absence of carbonyl groups. Our results show that the distribution of the carbonyl groups has a strong effect on the adsorption isotherms. For carbonyl groups localized in a narrow section the adsorption of water may be gradual because a cluster of adsorbed water forms at low pressures and grows as the pressure increases. For carbonyl groups distributed along the nanotube the adsorption isotherm is of type V.},

abstract = {Markov state models of molecular kinetics (MSMs), in which the long-time statistical dynamics of a molecule is approximated by a Markov chain on a discrete partition of configuration space, have seen widespread use in recent years. This approach has many appealing characteristics compared to straightforward molecular dynamics simulation and analysis, including the potential to mitigate the sampling problem by extracting long-time kinetic information from short trajectories and the ability to straightforwardly calculate expectation values and statistical uncertainties of various stationary and dynamical molecular observables. In this paper, we summarize the current state of the art in generation and validation of MSMs and give some important new results. We describe an upper bound for the approximation error made by modeling molecular dynamics with a MSM and we show that this error can be made arbitrarily small with surprisingly little effort. In contrast to previous practice, it becomes clear that the best MSM is not obtained by the most metastable discretization, but the MSM can be much improved if non-metastable states are introduced near the transition states. Moreover, we show that it is not necessary to resolve all slow processes by the state space partitioning, but individual dynamical processes of interest can be resolved separately. We also present an efficient estimator for reversible transition matrices and a robust test to validate that a MSM reproduces the kinetics of the molecular dynamics data.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli lactose permease (LacY) transports sugar across the inner membrane of the bacterium using the proton motive force to accumulate sugar in the cytosol. We have probed lactose conduction across LacY using steered molecular dynamics, permitting us to follow molecular and energetic details of lactose interaction with the lumen of LacY during its permeation. Lactose induces a widening of the narrowest parts of the channel during permeation, the widening being largest within the periplasmic half-channel. During permeation, the water-filled lumen of LacY only partially hydrates lactose, forcing it to interact with channel lining residues. Lactose forms a multitude of direct sugar-channel hydrogen bonds, predominantly with residues of the flexible N-domain, which is known to contribute a major part of LacY's affinity for lactose. In the periplasmic half-channel lactose predominantly interacts with hydrophobic channel lining residues, whereas in the cytoplasmic half-channel key protein-substrate interactions are mediated by ionic residues. A major energy barrier against transport is found within a tight segment of the periplasmic half-channel where sugar hydration is minimal and protein-sugar interaction maximal. Upon unbinding from the binding pocket, lactose undergoes a rotation to permeate either half-channel with its long axis aligned parallel to the channel axis. The results hint at the possibility of a transport mechanism, in which lactose permeates LacY through a narrow periplasmic half-channel and a wide cytoplasmic half-channel, the opening of which is controlled by changes in protonation states of key protein side groups.},

abstract = {A wide variety of phytochemicals are consumed for their perceived health benefits. Many of these phytochemicals have been found to alter numerous cell functions, but the mechanisms underlying their biological activity tend to be poorly understood. Phenolic phytochemicals are particularly promiscuous modifiers of membrane protein function, suggesting that some of their actions may be due to a common, membrane bilayer-mediated mechanism. To test whether bilayer perturbation may underlie this diversity of actions, we examined five bioactive phenols reported to have medicinal value: capsaicin from chili peppers, curcumin from turmeric, EGCG from green tea, genistein from soybeans, and resveratrol from grapes. We find that each of these widely consumed phytochemicals alters lipid bilayer properties and the function of diverse membrane proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations show that these phytochemicals modify bilayer properties by localizing to the bilayer/solution interface. Bilayer-modifying propensity was verified using a gramicidin-based assay, and indiscriminate modulation of membrane protein function was demonstrated using four proteins: membrane-anchored metalloproteases, mechanosensitive ion channels, and voltage-dependent potassium and sodium channels. Each protein exhibited similar responses to multiple phytochemicals, consistent with a common, bilayer-mediated mechanism. Our results suggest that many effects of amphiphilic phytochemicals are due to cell membrane perturbations, rather than specific protein binding.},

abstract = {Liquid water's isothermal compressibility and isobaric heat capacity, and the magnitude of its thermal expansion coefficient, increase sharply on cooling below the equilibrium freezing point. Many experimental, theoretical and computational studies have sought to understand the molecular origin and implications of this anomalous behaviour. Of the different theoretical scenarios put forward, one posits the existence of a first-order phase transition that involves two forms of liquid water and terminates at a critical point located at deeply supercooled conditions. Some experimental evidence is consistent with this hypothesis, but no definitive proof of a liquid-liquid transition in water has been obtained to date: rapid ice crystallization has so far prevented decisive measurements on deeply supercooled water, although this challenge has been overcome recently. Computer simulations are therefore crucial for exploring water's structure and behaviour in this regime, and have shown that some water models exhibit liquid-liquid transitions and others do not. However, recent work has argued that the liquid-liquid transition has been mistakenly interpreted, and is in fact a liquid-crystal transition in all atomistic models of water. Here we show, by studying the liquid-liquid transition in the ST2 model of water with the use of six advanced sampling methods to compute the free-energy surface, that two metastable liquid phases and a stable crystal phase exist at the same deeply supercooled thermodynamic condition, and that the transition between the two liquids satisfies the thermodynamic criteria of a first-order transition. We follow the rearrangement of water's coordination shell and topological ring structure along a thermodynamically reversible path from the low-density liquid to cubic ice. We also show that the system fluctuates freely between the two liquid phases rather than crystallizing. These findings provide unambiguous evidence for a liquid-liquid transition in the ST2 model of water, and point to the separation of time scales between crystallization and relaxation as being crucial for enabling it.},

abstract = {Although general anesthetics are known to modulate the activity of ligand-gated ion channels in the Cys-loop superfamily, there is at present neither consensus on the underlying mechanisms, nor predictive models of this modulation. Viable models need to offer quantitative assessment of the relative importance of several identified anesthetic binding sites. However, to date, precise affinity data for individual sites has been challenging to obtain by biophysical means. Here, the likely role of pore block inhibition by the general anesthetics isoflurane and propofol of the prokaryotic pentameric channel GLIC is investigated by molecular simulations. Microscopic affinities are calculated for both single and double occupancy binding of isoflurane and propofol to the GLIC pore. Computations are carried out for an open-pore conformation in which the pore is restrained to crystallographic radius, and a closed-pore conformation that results from unrestrained molecular dynamics equilibration of the structure. The GLIC pore is predicted to be blocked at the micromolar concentrations for which inhibition by isofluorane and propofol is observed experimentally. Calculated affinities suggest that pore block by propofol occurs at signifcantly lower concentrations than those for which inhibition is observed: we argue that this discrepancy may result from binding of propofol to an allosteric site recently identified by X-ray crystallography, which may cause a competing gain-of-function effect. Affinities of isoflurane and propofol to the allosteric site are also calculated, and shown to be 3 mM for isoflurane and 10 $\mu$M for propofol; both anesthetics have a lower affinity for the allosteric site than for the unoccupied pore.},

abstract = {There is overwhelming evidence that ions are present near the vapor-liquid interface of aqueous salt solutions. Charged groups can also be driven to interfaces by attaching them to hydrophobic moieties. Despite their importance in many self-assembly phenomena, how ion-ion interactions are affected by interfaces is not understood. We use molecular simulations to show that the effective forces between small ions change character dramatically near the water vapor-liquid interface. Specifically, the water-mediated attraction between oppositely charged ions is enhanced relative to that in bulk water. Further, the repulsion between like-charged ions is weaker than that expected from a continuum dielectric description and can even become attractive as the ions are drawn to the vapor side. We show that thermodynamics of ion association are governed by a delicate balance of ion hydration, interfacial tension, and restriction of capillary fluctuations at the interface, leading to nonintuitive phenomena, such as water-mediated like charge attraction. "Sticky" electrostatic interactions may have important consequences on biomolecular structure, assembly, and aggregation at soft liquid interfaces. We demonstrate this by studying an interfacially active model peptide that changes its structure from $\alpha$-helical to a hairpin-turn-like one in response to charging of its ends.},

abstract = {To achieve the uptake of small, water-soluble nutrients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium, employs substrate-specific channels located within its outer membrane. In this paper, we present a detailed description of the single-channel characteristics of six members of the outer membrane carboxylate channel D (OccD) subfamily. Recent structural studies showed that the OccD proteins share common features, such as a closely related, monomeric, 18-stranded ??-barrel conformation and large extracellular loops, which are folded back into the channel lumen. Here, we report that the OccD proteins displayed single-channel activity with a unitary conductance covering an unusually broad range, between 20 and 670 pS, as well as a diverse gating dynamics. Interestingly, we found that cation selectivity is a conserved trait among all members of the OccD subfamily, bringing a new distinction between the members of the OccD subfamily and the anion-selective OccK channels. Conserved cation selectivity of the OccD channels is in accord with an increased specificity and selectivity of these proteins for positively charged, carboxylate-containing substrates. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Gene delivery to skeletal muscle is a promising strategy for the treatment of muscle disorders and for the systemic secretion of therapeutic proteins. However, present DNA delivery technologies have to be improved with regard to both the level of expression and interindividual variability. We report very efficient plasmid DNA transfer in muscle fibers by using square-wave electric pulses of low field strength (less than 300 V/cm) and of long duration (more than 1 ms). Contrary to the electropermeabilization-induced uptake of small molecules into muscle fibers, plasmid DNA has to be present in the tissue during the electric pulses, suggesting a direct effect of the electric field on DNA during electrotransfer. This i.m. electrotransfer method increases reporter and therapeutic gene expression by several orders of magnitude in various muscles in mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey. Moreover, i.m. electrotransfer strongly decreases variability. Stability of expression was observed for at least 9 months. With a pCMV-FGF1 plasmid coding for fibroblast growth factor 1, this protein was immunodetected in the majority of muscle fibers subjected to the electric pulses. DNA electrotransfer in muscle may have broad applications in gene therapy and in physiological, pharmacological, and developmental studies.},

To test whether a motif that promotes helix association in a soluble protein could do the same within a membrane, we designed a model transmembrane helix based on the GCN4 leucine zipper. We found in both detergent micelles and biological membranes that helix association is driven strongly by asparagine, independent of the rest of the hydrophobic leucine and/or valine sequence. Hydrogen bonding between membrane helices gives stronger associations than the packing of surfaces in glycophorin A helices, creating an opportunity to stabilize structures, but also implying a danger that non-specific interactions might occur. Thus, membrane proteins may fold to avoid exposure of strongly hydrogen bonding groups at their lipid exposed surfaces.},

abstract = {The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the prototypic member of the 'Cys-loop' superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels which mediate synaptic neurotransmission, and whose other members include receptors for glycine, gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin. Cryo-electron microscopy has yielded a three-dimensional structure of the nAChR in its closed state. However, the exact nature and location of the channel gate remains uncertain. Although the transmembrane pore is constricted close to its center, it is not completely occluded. Rather, the pore has a central hydrophobic zone of radius about 3 A. Model calculations suggest that such a constriction may form a hydrophobic gate, preventing movement of ions through a channel. We present a detailed and quantitative simulation study of the hydrophobic gating model of the nicotinic receptor, in order to fully evaluate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that the hydrophobic constriction of the nAChR pore indeed forms a closed gate. Potential of mean force (PMF) calculations reveal that the constriction presents a barrier of height about 10 kT to the permeation of sodium ions, placing an upper bound on the closed channel conductance of 0.3 pS. Thus, a 3 A radius hydrophobic pore can form a functional barrier to the permeation of a 1 A radius Na+ ion. Using a united-atom force field for the protein instead of an all-atom one retains the qualitative features but results in differing conductances, showing that the PMF is sensitive to the detailed molecular interactions.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous aquaporin channels are able to conduct water across cell membranes, combining the seemingly antagonist functions of a very high selectivity with a remarkable permeability. Whereas molecular details are obvious keys to perform these tasks, the overall efficiency of transport in such nanopores is also strongly limited by viscous dissipation arising at the connection between the nanoconstriction and the nearby bulk reservoirs. In this contribution, we focus on these so-called entrance effects and specifically examine whether the characteristic hourglass shape of aquaporins may arise from a geometrical optimum for such hydrodynamic dissipation. Using a combination of finite-element calculations and analytical modeling, we show that conical entrances with suitable opening angle can indeed provide a large increase of the overall channel permeability. Moreover, the optimal opening angles that maximize the permeability are found to compare well with the angles measured in a large variety of aquaporins. This suggests that the hourglass shape of aquaporins could be the result of a natural selection process toward optimal hydrodynamic transport. Finally, in a biomimetic perspective, these results provide guidelines to design artificial nanopores with optimal performances.},

abstract = {The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) mediates rapid excitatory responses through ligand-gated channels (5-HT3 receptors). Recombinant expression of the only identified receptor subunit (5-HT3A) yields functional 5-HT3 receptors. However, the conductance of these homomeric receptors (sub-picosiemens) is too small to be resolved directly, and contrasts with a robust channel conductance displayed by neuronal 5-HT3 receptors (9-17 pS). Neuronal 5-HT3 receptors also display a permeability to calcium ions and a current-voltage relationship that differ from those of homomeric receptors. Here we describe a new class of 5-HT3-receptor subunit (5-HT3B). Transcripts of this subunit are co-expressed with the 5-HT3A subunit in the amygdala, caudate and hippocampus. Heteromeric assemblies of 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits display a large single-channel conductance (16 pS), low permeability to calcium ions, and a current-voltage relationship which resembles that of characterized neuronal 5-HT3 channels. The heteromeric receptors also display distinctive pharmacological properties. Surprisingly, the M2 region of the 5-HT3B subunit lacks any of the structural features that are known to promote the conductance of related receptors. In addition to providing a new target for therapeutic agents, the 5-HT3B subunit will be a valuable resource for defining the molecular mechanisms of ion-channel function.},

abstract = {Interactions of Na(+), K(+), Rb(+), and Cs(+) ions within the selectivity filter of a potassium channel have been investigated via multiple molecular dynamics simulations (total simulation time, 48 ns) based on the high resolution structure of KcsA, embedded in a phospholipid bilayer. As in simulations based on a lower resolution structure of KcsA, concerted motions of ions and water within the filter are seen. Despite the use of a higher resolution structure and the inclusion of four buried water molecules thought to stabilize the filter, this region exhibits a significant degree of flexibility. In particular, pronounced distortion of filter occurs if no ions are present within it. The two most readily permeant ions, K(+) and Rb(+), are similar in their interactions with the selectivity filter. In contrast, Na(+) ions tend to distort the filter by binding to a ring of four carbonyl oxygens. The larger Cs(+) ions result in a small degree of expansion of the filter relative to the x-ray structure. Cs(+) ions also appear to interact differently with the gate region of the channel, showing some tendency to bind within a predominantly hydrophobic pocket. The four water molecules buried between the back of the selectivity filter and the remainder of the protein show comparable mobility to the surrounding protein and do not exchange with water molecules within the filter or the central cavity. A preliminary comparison of the use of particle mesh Ewald versus cutoff protocols for the treatment of long-range electrostatics suggests some difference in the kinetics of ion translocation within the filter.},

Here, we show that when five consecutive histidine residues replace amino acids 130-134 at the midpoint of the loop, they provide a switch with which pore activity can be (i) turned off by micromolar concentrations of divalent zinc ions and (ii) turned back on with the chelating agent EDTA. Planar bilayer recordings show that Zn2+ and EDTA can act on open channels from either side of the bilayer and thus demonstrate that the central loop lines part of the conductive pathway. Our results suggest that genetically-engineered pore-forming proteins might make useful components of metal ion sensors.},

To address this limitation, we introduce a correction algorithm and assembly strategy that uses short, high-fidelity sequences to correct the error in single-molecule sequences. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on reads generated by a PacBio RS instrument from phage, prokaryotic and eukaryotic whole genomes, including the previously unsequenced genome of the parrot Melopsittacus undulatus, as well as for RNA-Seq reads of the corn (Zea mays) transcriptome. Our long-read correction achieves >99.9% base-call accuracy, leading to substantially better assemblies than current sequencing strategies: in the best example, the median contig size was quintupled relative to high-coverage, second-generation assemblies. Greater gains are predicted if read lengths continue to increase, including the prospect of single-contig bacterial chromosome assembly.},

abstract = {Bacteria and eukaryotic cells contain geometry-sensing tools in their cytosol: protein motifs or domains that recognize the curvature, concave or convex, deep or shallow, of lipid membranes. These sensors contrast with classical lipid-binding domains by their extended structure and, sometimes, counterintuitive chemistry. Among the sensors are long amphipathic helices, such as the ALPS motif and the N-terminal region of $\alpha$-synuclein, whose apparent "design defects" translate into a remarkable ability to specifically adsorb to the surface of small vesicles. Fundamental differences in the lipid composition of membranes of the early and late secretory pathways probably explain why some sensors use mostly electrostatics whereas others take advantage of the hydrophobic effect. Membrane curvature sensors help to organize very diverse reactions, such as lipid transfer between membranes, the tethering of vesicles at the Golgi apparatus, and the assembly-disassembly cycle of protein coats.},

abstract = {This study develops a model for a single cell electroporated by an external electric field and uses it to investigate the effects of shock strength and rest potential on the transmembrane potential V(m) and pore density N around the cell. As compared to the induced potential predicted by resistive-capacitive theory, the model of electroporation predicts a smaller magnitude of V(m) throughout the cell. Both V(m) and N are symmetric about the equator with the same value at both poles of the cell. Larger shocks do not increase the maximum magnitude of V(m) because more pores form to shunt the excess stimulus current across the membrane. In addition, the value of the rest potential does not affect V(m) around the cell because the electroporation current is several orders of magnitude larger than the ionic current that supports the rest potential. Once the field is removed, the shock-induced V(m) discharges within 2 micros, but the pores persist in the membrane for several seconds. Complete resealing to preshock conditions requires approximately 20 s. These results agree qualitatively and quantitatively with the experimental data reported by Kinosita and coworkers for unfertilized sea urchin eggs exposed to large electric fields.},

@article{Beckstein2003a,
abstract = {Water plays a key role in biological membrane transport. In ion channels and water-conducting pores (aquaporins), one-dimensional confinement in conjunction with strong surface effects changes the physical behavior of water. In molecular dynamics simulations of water in short (0.8 nm) hydrophobic pores the water density in the pore fluctuates on a nanosecond time scale. In long simulations (460 ns in total) at pore radii ranging from 0.35 to 1.0 nm we quantify the kinetics of oscillations between a liquid-filled and a vapor-filled pore. This behavior can be explained as capillary evaporation alternating with capillary condensation, driven by pressure fluctuations in the water outside the pore. The free-energy difference between the two states depends linearly on the radius. The free-energy landscape shows how a metastable liquid state gradually develops with increasing radius. For radii > approximately 0.55 nm it becomes the globally stable state and the vapor state vanishes. One-dimensional confinement affects the dynamic behavior of the water molecules and increases the self diffusion by a factor of 2-3 compared with bulk water. Permeabilities for the narrow pores are of the same order of magnitude as for biological water pores. Water flow is not continuous but occurs in bursts. Our results suggest that simulations aimed at collective phenomena such as hydrophobic effects may require simulation times >50 ns. For water in confined geometries, it is not possible to extrapolate from bulk or short time behavior to longer time scales.},

Challenges include control of nanopore diameters and surface chemistry, modification of the translocation times of single-molecule analytes through nanopores, and prevention of non-specific interactions with pore walls. Here, inspired by the olfactory sensilla of insect antennae, we show that coating nanopores with a fluid lipid bilayer tailors their surface chemistry and allows fine-tuning and dynamic variation of pore diameters in subnanometre increments. Incorporation of mobile ligands in the lipid bilayer conferred specificity and slowed the translocation of targeted proteins sufficiently to time-resolve translocation events of individual proteins. Lipid coatings also prevented pores from clogging, eliminated non-specific binding and enabled the translocation of amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) oligomers and fibrils. Through combined analysis of their translocation time, volume, charge, shape and ligand affinity, different proteins were identified.},

abstract = {The detection of organic molecules is important in many areas, including medicine, environmental monitoring and defence. Stochastic sensing is an approach that relies on the observation of individual binding events between analyte molecules and a single receptor. Engineered transmembrane protein pores are promising sensor elements for stochastic detection, and in their simplest manifestation they produce a fluctuating binary ('on/off') response in the transmembrane electrical current. The frequency of occurrence of the fluctuations reveals the concentration of the analyte, and its identity can be deduced from the characteristic magnitude and/or duration of the fluctuations. Genetically engineered versions of the bacterial pore-forming protein alpha-haemolysin have been used to identify and quantify divalent metal ions in solution. But it is not immediately obvious how versatile binding sites for organic ligands might be obtained by engineering of the pore structure. Here we show that stochastic sensing of organic molecules can be procured from alpha-haemolysin by equipping the channel with an internal, non-covalently bound molecular 'adapter' which mediates channel blocking by the analyte. We use cyclodextrins as the adapters because these fit comfortably inside the pore and present a hydrophobic cavity suitable for binding a variety of organic analytes. Moreover, a single sensing element of this sort can be used to analyse a mixture of organic molecules with different binding characteristics. We envisage the use of other adapters, so that the pore could be 'programmed' for a range of sensing functions.},

abstract = {The transformation between a gel and a fluid phase in dipalmitoyl- phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers has been simulated using a coarse grained (CG) model by cooling bilayer patches composed of up to 8000 lipids. The critical step in the transformation process is the nucleation of a gel cluster consisting of 20-80 lipids, spanning both monolayers. After the formation of the critical cluster, a fast growth regime is entered. Growth slows when multiple gel domains start interacting, forming a percolating network. Long-lived fluid domains remain trapped and can be metastable on a microsecond time scale. From the temperature dependence of the rate of cluster growth, the line tension of the fluid-gel interface was estimated to be 3??2 pN. The reverse process is observed when heating the gel phase. No evidence is found for a hexatic phase as an intermediate stage of melting. The hysteresis observed in the freezing and melting transformation is found to depend both on the system size and on the time scale of the simulation. Extrapolating to macroscopic length and time scales, the transition temperature for heating and cooling converges to 295??5 K, in semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental value for DPPC (315 K). The phase transformation is associated with a drop in lateral mobility of the lipids by two orders of magnitude, and an increase in the rotational correlation time of the same order of magnitude. The lipid headgroups, however, remain fluid. These observations are in agreement with experimental findings, and show that the nature of the ordered phase obtained with the CG model is indeed a gel rather than a crystalline phase. Simulations performed at different levels of hydration furthermore show that the gel phase is stabilized at low hydration. A simulation of a small DPPC vesicle reveals that curvature has the opposite effect. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The 5-HT(3) receptor is a pentameric serotonin-gated ion channel, which mediates rapid excitatory neurotransmission and is the target of a therapeutically important class of anti-emetic drugs, such as granisetron. We report crystal structures of a binding protein engineered to recognize the agonist serotonin and the antagonist granisetron with affinities comparable to the 5-HT(3) receptor. In the serotonin-bound structure, we observe hydrophilic interactions with loop E-binding site residues, which might enable transitions to channel opening. In the granisetron-bound structure, we observe a critical cation-$\pi$ interaction between the indazole moiety of the ligand and a cationic centre in loop D, which is uniquely present in the 5-HT(3) receptor. We use a series of chemically tuned granisetron analogues to demonstrate the energetic contribution of this electrostatic interaction to high-affinity ligand binding in the human 5-HT(3) receptor. Our study offers the first structural perspective on recognition of serotonin and antagonism by anti-emetics in the 5-HT(3) receptor.},

Whereas most studies so far focused on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules, exploration of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is of great interest as well, for example to employ such a nanopore device to read out the sequence. Here, we study the translocation of long random-sequence ssDNA through nanopores. Using atomic force microscopy, we observe the ssDNA to hybridize into a random coil, forming blobs of around 100 nm in diameter for 7 kb ssDNA. These large entangled structures have to unravel, when they arrive at the pore entrance. Indeed, we observe strong blockade events with a translocation time that is exponentially dependent on voltage, tau approximately e(-V/V(0)). Interestingly, this is very different than for dsDNA, for which tau approximately 1/V. We report translocations of ssDNA but also of ssDNA-dsDNA constructs where we compare the conductance-blockade levels for ssDNA versus dsDNA as a function of voltage.},

abstract = {Structural studies of membrane proteins are still hampered by difficulties of finding appropriate membrane-mimicking media that maintain protein structure and function. Phospholipid nanodiscs seem promising to overcome the intrinsic problems of detergent-containing environments. While nanodiscs can offer a near-native environment, the large particle size complicates their routine use in the structural analysis of membrane proteins by solution NMR. Here, we introduce nanodiscs assembled from shorter ApoA-I protein variants that are of markedly smaller diameter and show that the resulting discs provide critical improvements for the structure determination of membrane proteins by NMR. Using the bacterial outer-membrane protein OmpX as an example, we demonstrate that the combination of small nanodisc size, high deuteration levels of protein and lipids, and the use of advanced non-uniform NMR sampling methods enable the NMR resonance assignment as well as the high-resolution structure determination of polytopic membrane proteins in a detergent-free, near-native lipid bilayer setting. By applying this method to bacteriorhodopsin, we show that our smaller nanodiscs can also be beneficial for the structural characterization of the important class of seven-transmembrane helical proteins. Our set of engineered nanodiscs of subsequently smaller diameters can be used to screen for optimal NMR spectral quality for small to medium-sized membrane proteins while still providing a functional environment. In addition to their key improvements for de novo structure determination, due to their smaller size these nanodiscs enable the investigation of interactions between membrane proteins and their (soluble) partner proteins, unbiased by the presence of detergents that might disrupt biologically relevant interactions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acetylcholine receptor type ligand-gated ion channels (ART-LGIC; also known as Cys-loop receptors) are a superfamily of proteins that include the receptors for major neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, serotonin, glycine, GABA, glutamate and histamine, and for Zn2+ ions. They play a central role in fast synaptic signaling in animal nervous systems and so far have not been found outside of the Metazoa. RESULTS: Using sensitive sequence-profile searches we have identified homologs of ART-LGICs in several bacteria and a single archaeal genus, Methanosarcina. The homology between the animal receptors and the prokaryotic homologs spans the entire length of the former, including both the ligand-binding and channel-forming transmembrane domains. A sequence-structure analysis using the structure of Lymnaea stagnalis acetylcholine-binding protein and the newly detected prokaryotic versions indicates the presence of at least one aromatic residue in the ligand-binding boxes of almost all representatives of the superfamily. Investigation of the domain architectures of the bacterial forms shows that they may often show fusions with other small-molecule-binding domains, such as the periplasmic binding protein superfamily I (PBP-I), Cache and MCP-N domains. Some of the bacterial forms also occur in predicted operons with the genes of the PBP-II superfamily and the Cache domains. Analysis of phyletic patterns suggests that the ART-LGICs are currently absent in all other eukaryotic lineages except animals. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis and conserved sequence motifs also suggest that a subset of the bacterial forms is closer to the metazoan forms. CONCLUSIONS: From the information from the bacterial forms we infer that cation-pi or hydrophobic interactions with the ligand are likely to be a pervasive feature of the entire superfamily, even though the individual residues involved in the process may vary. The conservation pattern in the channel-forming transmembrane domains also suggests similar channel-gating mechanisms in the prokaryotic versions. From the distribution of charged residues in the prokaryotic M2 transmembrane segments, we expect that there will be examples of both cation and anion selectivity within the prokaryotic members. Contextual connections suggest that the prokaryotic forms may function as chemotactic receptors for low molecular weight solutes. The phyletic patterns and phylogenetic relationships suggest the possibility that the metazoan receptors emerged through an early lateral transfer from a prokaryotic source, before the divergence of extant metazoan lineages.},

Previous computational studies revealed that the obstruction of the channel by lipid headgroups can be long-lived, in the range of nanoseconds, and that pore-length-matching membrane mimetics could speed up water permeability. To test the hypothesis of lipid-channel interactions modulating channel permeability, we designed different gramicidin A derivatives with attached acyl chains. By combining extensive molecular-dynamics simulations and single-channel water permeation measurements, we show that by tuning lipid-channel interactions, these modifications reduce the presence of lipid headgroups in the pore, which leads to a clear and selective increase in their water permeability.},

Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and experiment, we investigate the temperature-dependent intrusion/adsorption of water molecules into hydrophobic nanopores (carbon nanotubes and nanoporous carbon) and the underlying mechanisms. The critical infiltration pressure is reduced for elevated temperature or increased pore size. The variation of wettability is related to the thermally responsive fluid characteristics, such as the surface tension and contact angle, which arise from the variations of multiple atomic variables including the confined water density, hydrogen bond, and dipole orientation. With thermal perturbation, most of these physical quantities are found to be more significantly influenced in the confined nanoenvironment than in the bulk. By utilizing the prominent thermal effect at the nanoscale, the feasibility and prospective efficiency of employing nanofluidics for energy storage, actuation, and thermal monitoring are discussed.},

We used bioinformatic modeling of the ChR2 structure to identify the putative cationic pathway within the channel, which is formed by a system of inner cavities that are uniquely present in this microbial rhodopsin. Site-directed mutagenesis combined with patch clamp analysis in HeLa cells was used to determine key residues involved in ChR2 conductance and selectivity. Among them, Gln-56 is important for ion conductance, whereas Ser-63, Thr-250, and Asn-258 are previously unrecognized residues involved in ion selectivity and photocurrent kinetics. This study widens the current structural information on ChR2 and can assist in the design of new improved variants for specific biological applications.},

abstract = {The cardiac muscle protein titin, responsible for developing passive elasticity and extensibility of muscle, possesses about 40 immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains in its I-band region. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) have been successfully combined to investigate the reversible unfolding of individual Ig domains. However, previous SMD studies of titin I-band modules have been restricted to I27, the only structurally known Ig domain from the distal region of the titin I-band. In this paper we report SMD simulations unfolding I1, the first structurally available Ig domain from the proximal region of the titin I-band. The simulations are carried out with a view toward upcoming atomic force microscopy experiments. Both constant velocity and constant force stretching have been employed to model mechanical unfolding of oxidized I1, which has a disulfide bond bridging beta-strands C and E, as well as reduced I1, in which the disulfide bridge is absent. The simulations reveal that I1 is protected against external stress mainly through six interstrand hydrogen bonds between its A and B beta-strands. The disulfide bond enhances the mechanical stability of oxidized I1 domains by restricting the rupture of backbone hydrogen bonds between the A'- and G-strands. The disulfide bond also limits the maximum extension of I1 to approximately 220 A. Comparison of the unfolding pathways of I1 and I27 are provided and implications to AFM experiments are discussed.},

abstract = {A molecular dynamics (MD) scheme is combined with a distributed circuit model for a self-consistent analysis of the transient membrane response for cells subjected to an ultrashort (nanosecond) high-intensity (approximately 0.01-V/nm spatially averaged field) voltage pulse. The dynamical, stochastic, many-body aspects are treated at the molecular level by resorting to a course-grained representation of the membrane lipid molecules. Coupling the Smoluchowski equation to the distributed electrical model for current flow provides the time-dependent transmembrane fields for the MD simulations. A good match between the simulation results and available experimental data is obtained. Predictions include pore formation times of about 5-6 ns. It is also shown that the pore formation process would tend to begin from the anodic side of an electrically stressed membrane. Furthermore, the present simulations demonstrate that ions could facilitate pore formation. This could be of practical importance and have direct relevance to the recent observations of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum in cells subjected to such ultrashort, high-intensity pulses.},

abstract = {Aquaporins are transmembrane channels found in cell membranes of all life forms. We examine their apparently paradoxical property, facilitation of efficient permeation of water while excluding protons, which is of critical importance to preserving the electrochemical potential across the cell membrane. We have determined the structure of the Escherichia coli aquaglyceroporin GlpF with bound water, in native (2.7 angstroms) and in W48F/F200T mutant (2.1 angstroms) forms, and carried out 12-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations that define the spatial and temporal probability distribution and orientation of a single file of seven to nine water molecules inside the channel. Two conserved asparagines force a central water molecule to serve strictly as a hydrogen bond donor to its neighboring water molecules. Assisted by the electrostatic potential generated by two half-membrane spanning loops, this dictates opposite orientations of water molecules in the two halves of the channel, and thus prevents the formation of a "proton wire," while permitting rapid water diffusion. Both simulations and observations revealed a more regular distribution of channel water and an increased water permeability for the W48F/F200T mutant.},

abstract = {Using rational membrane protein design, we were recently able to obtain a ??-barrel protein nanopore that was robust under an unusually broad range of experimental circumstances. This protein nanopore was based upon the native scaffold of the bacterial ferric hydroxamate uptake component A (FhuA) of Escherichia coli. In this work, we expanded the examinations of the open-state current of this engineered protein nanopore, also called FhuA ??C/??4L, employing an array of lipid bilayer systems that contained charged and uncharged as well as conical and cylindrical lipids. Remarkably, systematical single-channel analysis of FhuA ??C/??4L indicated that most of its biophysical features, such as the unitary conductance and the stability of the open-state current, were not altered under the conditions tested in this work. However, electrical recordings at high transmembrane potentials revealed that the presence of conical phospholipids within the bilayer catalyzes the first, stepwise current transition of the FhuA ??C/??4L protein nanopore to a lower-conductance open state. This study reinforces the stability of the open-state current of the engineered FhuA ??C/??4L protein nanopore under various experimental conditions, paving the way for further critical developments in biosensing and molecular biomedical diagnosis. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Serial multiscale methods that parameterize low-resolution coarse-grained models with data from high-resolution models have studied long time or length scale phenomena that cannot be investigated with atomically detailed models. Parallel multiscale methods that directly couple high- and low-resolution models have efficiently explored slow structural transitions and the importance of long-wavelength fluctuations for biological molecules. The success of such models relies upon new theories and methods for constructing accurate multiscale bridges that transfer information between models with different resolutions.},

abstract = {Protein nanopores have attracted much interest for nucleic acid sequencing, chemical sensing, and protein folding at the single molecule level. The outer membrane protein OmpG from E. coli stands out because it forms a nanopore from a single polypeptide chain. This property allows the separate engineering of each of the seven extracellular loops that control access to the pore. The longest of these loops, loop 6, has been recognized as the main gating loop that closes the pore at low pH values and opens it at high pH values. A method was devised to pin each of the loops to the embedding membrane and measure the single-pore conductances of the resulting constructs. The electrophysiological and complementary NMR measurements show that the pinning of individual loops alters the structure and dynamics of neighboring and distant loops in a correlated fashion. Pinning loop 6 generates a constitutively open pore and patterns of concerted loop motions control access to the OmpG nanopore.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes offer exciting opportunities for devising highly-sensitive detectors of specific molecules in biology and the environment. Detection limits as low as 10(-11) M have already been achieved using nanotube-based sensors. We propose the design of a biosensor comprised of functionalized carbon nanotube pores embedded in a silicon-nitride or other membrane, fluorofullerene-Fragment antigen-binding (Fab fragment) conjugates, and polymer beads with complementary Fab fragments. We show by using molecular and stochastic dynamics that conduction through the (9, 9) exohydrogenated carbon nanotubes is 20 times larger than through the Ion Channel Switch ICS(TM) biosensor, and fluorofullerenes block the nanotube entrance with a dissociation constant as low as 37 pM. Under normal operating conditions and in the absence of analyte, fluorofullerenes block the nanotube pores and the polymer beads float around in the reservoir. When analyte is injected into the reservoir the Fab fragments attached to the fluorofullerene and polymer bead crosslink to the analyte. The drag of the much larger polymer bead then acts to pull the fluorofullerene from the nanotube entrance, thereby allowing the flow of monovalent cations across the membrane. Assuming a tight seal is formed between the two reservoirs, such a biosensor would be able to detect one channel opening and thus one molecule of analyte making it a highly sensitive detection design.},

abstract = {$\beta$-Barrel membrane proteins are found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. They are important for pore formation, membrane anchoring, and enzyme activity. These proteins are also often responsible for bacterial virulence. Due to difficulties in experimental structure determination, they are sparsely represented in the protein structure databank. We have developed a computational method for predicting structures of the transmembrane (TM) domains of $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins. Based on physical principles, our method can predict structures of the TM domain of $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins of novel topology, including those from eukaryotic mitochondria. Our method is based on a model of physical interactions, a discrete conformational state space, an empirical potential function, as well as a model to account for interstrand loop entropy. We are able to construct three-dimensional atomic structure of the TM domains from sequences for a set of 23 nonhomologous proteins (resolution 1.8-3.0 \AA). The median rmsd of TM domains containing 75-222 residues between predicted and measured structures is 3.9 \AA for main chain atoms. In addition, stability determinants and protein-protein interaction sites can be predicted. Such predictions on eukaryotic mitochondria outer membrane protein Tom40 and VDAC are confirmed by independent mutagenesis and chemical cross-linking studies. These results suggest that our model captures key components of the organization principles of $\beta$-barrel membrane protein assembly.},

abstract = {Nanopore technology employs a nanoscale hole in an insulating membrane to stochastically sense with high throughput individual biomolecules in solution. The generality of the nanopore detection principle and the ease of single-molecule detection suggest many potential applications of nanopores in biotechnology. Recent progress has been made with nanopore fabrication and sophistication, as well as with applications in DNA/protein mapping, biomolecular structure analysis, protein detection, and DNA sequencing. In addition, concepts for DNA sequencing devices have been suggested, and computational efforts have been made. The state of the nanopore field is maturing and given the right type of nanopore and operating conditions, nearly every application could revolutionize medicine in terms of speed, cost, and quality. In this review, we summarize progress in nanopores for biotechnological applications over the past 2-3 years.},

The study shows that current computational resources are powerful enough to generate a truly electrified interface, as we show the predicted effect of the field on the overall charge distribution.

abstract = {Aromatic residues are frequently found in helical and beta-barrel integral membrane proteins enriched at the membrane-water interface. Although the importance of these residues in membrane protein folding has been rationalized by thermodynamic partition measurements using peptide model systems, their contribution to the stability of bona fide membrane proteins has never been demonstrated. Here, we have investigated the contribution of interfacial aromatic residues to the thermodynamic stability of the beta-barrel outer membrane protein OmpA from Escherichia coli in lipid bilayers by performing extensive mutagenesis and equilibrium folding experiments. Isolated interfacial tryptophanes contribute -2.0 kcal/mol, isolated interfacial tyrosines contribute -2.6 kcal/mol, and isolated interfacial phenylalanines contribute -1.0 kcal/mol to the stability of this protein. These values agree well with the prediction from the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale, except for tyrosine residues, which contribute more than has been expected from the peptide models. Double mutant cycle analysis reveals that interactions between aromatic side chains become significant when their centroids are separated by less than 6 A but are nearly insignificant above 7 A. Aromatic-aromatic side chain interactions are on the order of -1.0 to -1.4 kcal/mol and do not appear to depend on the type of aromatic residue. These results suggest that the clustering of aromatic side chains at membrane interfaces provides an additional heretofore not yet recognized driving force for the folding and stability of integral membrane proteins.},

Surprisingly, the templated assembly is unique for (9, 9) CNTs and not observed for smaller or larger CNTs. The microscopic analysis based on the potential of mean force reveals that the highly selective assembly of (9, 9) CNTs into COF-8 is thermodynamically favorable, in contrast to other CNTs.

abstract = {Voltage-gated proton (Hv1) channels play important roles in the respiratory burst, in pH regulation, in spermatozoa, in apoptosis, and in cancer metastasis. Unlike other voltage-gated cation channels, the Hv1 channel lacks a centrally located pore formed by the assembly of subunits. Instead, the proton permeation pathway in the Hv1 channel is within the voltage-sensing domain of each subunit. The gating mechanism of this pathway is still unclear. Mutagenic and fluorescence studies suggest that the fourth transmembrane (TM) segment (S4) functions as a voltage sensor and that there is an outward movement of S4 during channel activation. Using thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis, we find that the conserved positively charged residues in S4 are stabilized by countercharges in the other TM segments both in the closed and open states. We constructed models of both the closed and open states of Hv1 channels that are consistent with the mutant cycle analysis. These structural models suggest that electrostatic interactions between TM segments in the closed state pull hydrophobic residues together to form a hydrophobic plug in the center of the voltage-sensing domain. Outward S4 movement during channel activation induces conformational changes that remove this hydrophobic plug and instead insert protonatable residues in the center of the channel that, together with water molecules, can form a hydrogen bond chain across the channel for proton permeation. This suggests that salt bridge networks and the hydrophobic plug function as the gate in Hv1 channels and that outward movement of S4 leads to the opening of this gate.},

abstract = {Nanosecond, megavolt-per-meter pulses--higher power but lower total energy than the electroporative pulses used to introduce normally excluded material into biological cells--produce large intracellular electric fields without destructively charging the plasma membrane. Nanoelectropulse perturbation of mammalian cells causes translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) to the outer face of the cell, intracellular calcium release, and in some cell types a subsequent progression to apoptosis. Experimental observations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of membranes in pulsed electric fields presented here support the hypothesis that nanoelectropulse-induced PS externalization is driven by the electric potential that appears across the lipid bilayer during a pulse and is facilitated by the poration of the membrane that occurs even during pulses as brief as 3 ns. MD simulations of phospholipid bilayers in supraphysiological electric fields show a tight association between PS externalization and membrane pore formation on a nanosecond time scale that is consistent with experimental evidence for electropermeabilization and anode-directed PS translocation after nanosecond electric pulse exposure, suggesting a molecular mechanism for nanoelectroporation and nanosecond PS externalization: electrophoretic migration of the negatively charged PS head group along the surface of nanometer-diameter electropores initiated by field-driven alignment of water dipoles at the membrane interface.},

abstract = {Beta-barrel membrane proteins occur in the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. The membrane-spanning sequences of beta-barrel membrane proteins are less hydrophobic than those of alpha-helical membrane proteins, which is probably the main reason why completely different folding and membrane assembly pathways have evolved for these two classes of membrane proteins. Some beta-barrel membrane proteins can be spontaneously refolded into lipid bilayer model membranes in vitro. They may also have this ability in vivo although lipid and protein chaperones likely assist with their assembly in appropriate target membranes. This review summarizes recent work on the thermodynamic stability and the mechanism of membrane insertion of beta-barrel membrane proteins in lipid model and biological membranes. How lipid compositions affect folding and assembly of beta-barrel membrane proteins is also reviewed. The stability of these proteins in membranes is not as large as previously thought (<10 kcal/mol) and is modulated by elastic forces of the lipid bilayer. Detailed kinetic studies indicate that beta-barrel membrane proteins fold in distinct steps with several intermediates that can be characterized in vitro. Formation of the barrel is synchronized with membrane insertion and all beta-hairpins insert simultaneously in a concerted pathway.},

Several suppressor mutations have been identified that restore export of the mutant lambda receptor protein. Mapping experiments show that the suppressor phenotype is the result of mutations in any of at least three different chromosomal loci. One class of suppressor mutations, the class containing the largest number of independent isolates, maps in the major ribosomal gene cluster, suggesting that the suppressor phenotype is the consequence of an altered ribosomal protein. This class of suppressors phenotypically suppresses all known export-defective mutations, internal to the signal sequence region of the lamB gene.

abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels composed of subunits that consist of an extracellular domain that carries the ligand-binding site and a distinct ion-pore domain. Signal transduction results from the allosteric coupling between the two domains: the distance from the binding site to the gate of the pore domain is 50 A. Normal mode analysis with a C(alpha) Gaussian network of a new structural model of the neuronal alpha7 nAChR showed that the lowest mode involves a global quaternary twist motion that opens the ion pore. A molecular probe analysis, in which the network is modified at each individual amino acid residue, demonstrated that the major effect is to change the frequency, but not the form, of the twist mode. The largest effects were observed for the ligand-binding site and the Cys-loop. Most (24/27) of spontaneous mutations known to cause congenital myasthenia and autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy are located either at the interface between subunits or, within a given subunit, at the interface between rigid blocks. These interfaces are modified significantly by the twist mode. The present analysis, thus, supports the quaternary twist model of the nAChR allosteric transition and provides a qualitative interpretation of the effect of the mutations responsible for several receptor pathologies.},

Here, we present a new WHAM implementation, termed g_wham, which is distributed freely with the GROMACS molecular simulation suite. g_wham estimates statistical errors using the technique of bootstrap analysis. Three bootstrap methods are supported: (i) bootstrapping new trajectories based on the umbrella histograms, (ii) bootstrapping of complete histograms, and (iii) Bayesian bootstrapping of complete histograms, that is, bootstrapping via the assignment of random weights to the histograms. Because methods ii and iii consider only complete histograms as independent data points, these methods do not require the accurate calculation of autocorrelation times. We demonstrate that, given sufficient sampling, bootstrapping new trajectories allows for an accurate error estimate. In the presence of long autocorrelations, however, (Bayesian) bootstrapping of complete histograms yields a more reliable error estimate, whereas bootstrapping of new trajectories may underestimate the error. In addition, we emphasize that the incorporation of autocorrelations into WHAM reduces the bias from limited sampling, in particular, when computing periodic PMFs in inhomogeneous systems such as solvated lipid membranes or protein channels.

Three bootstrap methods are supported: (i) bootstrapping new trajectories based on the umbrella histograms, (ii) bootstrapping of complete histograms, and (iii) Bayesian bootstrapping of complete histograms, that is, bootstrapping via the assignment of random weights to the histograms. Because methods ii and iii consider only complete histograms as independent data points, these methods do not require the accurate calculation of autocorrelation times. We demonstrate that, given sufficient sampling, bootstrapping new trajectories allows for an accurate error estimate. In the presence of long autocorrelations, however, (Bayesian) bootstrapping of complete histograms yields a more reliable error estimate, whereas bootstrapping of new trajectories may underestimate the error. In addition, we emphasize that the incorporation of autocorrelations into WHAM reduces the bias from limited sampling, in particular, when computing periodic PMFs in inhomogeneous systems such as solvated lipid membranes or protein channels.},

abstract = {A modified invertebrate glutamate-gated Cl(-) channel (GluCl $\alpha$$\beta$) was previously employed to allow pharmacologically induced silencing of electrical activity in CNS neurons upon exposure to the anthelmintic drug ivermectin (IVM). Usefulness of the previous receptor was limited by 1) the high concentration of IVM necessary to elicit a consistent silencing phenotype, raising concern about potential side effects, and 2) the variable extent of neuronal spike suppression, due to variations in the co-expression levels of the fluorescent protein-tagged $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits. To address these issues, mutant receptors generated via rational protein engineering strategies were examined for improvement. Introduction of a gain-of-function mutation (L9'F) in the second transmembrane domain of the $\alpha$ subunit appears to facilitate $\beta$ subunit incorporation and substantially increase heteromeric GluCl $\alpha$$\beta$ sensitivity to IVM. Removal of an arginine-based endoplasmic reticulum retention motif (RSR mutated to AAA) from the intracellular loop of the $\beta$ subunit further promotes heteromeric expression at the plasma membrane possibly by preventing endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of the $\beta$ subunit rather than simply reducing endoplasmic reticulum retention. A monomeric XFP (mXFP) mutation that prevents fluorescent protein dimerization complements the mutant channel effects. Expression of the newly engineered GluCl opt $\alpha$-mXFP L9'F + opt $\beta$-mXFP Y182F RSR_AAA receptor in dissociated neuronal cultures markedly increases conductance and reduces variability in spike suppression at 1 nm IVM. This receptor, named "GluClv2.0," is an improved tool for IVM-induced silencing.},

To use the elastic model approach further for developing the details of protein mechanisms, it becomes essential to expand this model to include the added details of the directions of individual residue fluctuations.

In the presence of cholesterol, recombinant VDAC-1 can form voltage-gated channels in phospholipid bilayers similar to those of the native protein. NMR measurements revealed the binding sites of VDAC-1 for the Bcl-2 protein Bcl-x(L), for reduced beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and for cholesterol.

abstract = {Nanopores have demonstrated an extraordinary ability to allow water molecules to pass through their interiors at rates far exceeding expectations based on continuum theory. Moreover, simulation studies suggest that particular nanoscale pores have the potential to discriminate between water and salts as well as to distinguish between a range of different ion types. Some of the unusual features of transport in these nanopores have been elucidated with molecular dynamics simulation, specifically the spontaneous filling and rapid transport of water, the rejection of ions and the selection between ions. The main focus of this review, however, is the physical mechanisms which act to produce such remarkable behaviour at this scale, drawing on the many studies that have been conducted in the last decade. Since molecular dynamics simulations allow the motion of individual atoms to be followed over time, they have the potential to provide fundamental insight into the reasons why transport in nanoscale pores differs from expectations based on macroscopic theory. Gaining an understanding of the mechanisms of transport in these tiny pores should guide future experiments in this area aimed at developing novel technologies and improving existing membrane separation techniques.},

abstract = {Electric impulses (8 kV/cm, 5 microseconds) were found to increase greatly the uptake of DNA into cells. When linear or circular plasmid DNA containing the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (TK) gene is added to a suspension of mouse L cells deficient in the TK gene and the cells are then exposed to electric fields, stable transformants are formed that survive in the HAT selection medium. At 20 degrees C after the application of three successive electric impulses followed by 10 min to allow DNA entry there result 95 (+/- 3) transformants per 10(6) cells and per 1.2 micrograms DNA. Compared with biochemical techniques, the electric field method of gene transfer is very simple, easily applicable, and very efficient. Because the mechanism of DNA transport through cell membranes is not known, a simple physical model for the enhanced DNA penetration into cells in high electric fields is proposed. According to this ' electroporation model' the interaction of the external electric field with the lipid dipoles of a pore configuration induces and stabilizes the permeation sites and thus enhances cross membrane transport.},

These theoretical results were then compared with data from mutagenesis experiments, in which the response of the 5-HT(3) receptor was measured when the proline at the apex of the M2-M3 transmembrane domain loop was mutated. The strong correlation between the experimental and the theoretical data supports the existence of a trans-cis proline switch for opening the 5-HT(3) receptor ion channel.},

However, the interactions between the PEGylated drugs and biomembranes are not clearly understood. In this study, we employed atomic-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to consider the behavior of two drug molecules functionalized with PEG (tetraphenylporphyrin used in cancer phototherapy and biochanin A belonging to the isoflavone family) in the presence of a lipid bilayer. The commonly held view is that functionalization of a drug molecule with a polymer acts as an entropic barrier, inhibiting the penetration of the drug molecule through a cell membrane. Our results indicate that in the bloodstream there is an additional source of electrostatic repulsive interactions between the PEGylated drugs and the lipid bilayer. Both the PEG chain and lipids can bind Na(+) ions, thus effectively becoming positively charged molecules. This leads to an extra repulsive effect resulting from the presence of salt in the bloodstream. Thus, our study sheds further light on the role of PEG in drug delivery.},

abstract = {Interactions between salt ions and lipid components of biological membranes are essential for the structure, stability, and functions of the membranes. The specific ionic composition of aqueous buffers inside and outside of the cell is known to differ considerably. To model such a situation we perform atomistic molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of a single-component phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayer which separates two aqueous reservoirs with and without NaCl salt. To implement the difference in electrolyte composition near two membrane sides, a double bilayer setup (i.e., two bilayers in a simulation box) is employed. It turns out that monovalent salt, being in contact with one leaflet only, induces a pronounced asymmetry in the structural, electrostatic, and dynamical properties of bilayer leaflets after 50 ns of MD simulations. Binding of sodium ions to the carbonyl region of the leaflet which is in contact with salt results in the formation of "Na-lipids" complexes and, correspondingly, reduces mobility of lipids of this leaflet. In turn, attractive interactions of chloride ions (mainly located in the aqueous phase close to the water-lipid interface) with choline lipid groups lead to a substantial (more vertical) reorientation of postphatidylcholine headgroups of the leaflet adjoined to salt. The difference in headgroup orientation on two sides of a bilayer, being coupled with salt-induced reorientation of water dipoles, leads to a notable asymmetry in the charge-density profiles and electrostatic potentials of bilayer constitutes of the two leaflets. Although the overall charge density of the bilayer is found to be almost insensitive to the presence of salt, a slight asymmetry in the charge distribution between the two bilayer leaflets results in a nonzero potential difference of about 85 mV between the two water phases. Thus, a transmembrane potential of the order of the membrane potential in a cell can arise without ionic charge imbalance between two aqueous compartments.},

The 5-HT3 receptor binding site is composed of six loops from two adjacent subunits, and the critical ligand binding residues within these loops are well documented. There are a range of 5-HT3 receptor agonists and competitive antagonists, but it is the antagonists that dominate their clinical use. Studies have proposed a range of disease symptoms that might be amenable to 5-HT3 receptor selective compounds; however, so far only the treatment of emesis and irritable bowel syndrome have been fully realised.

abstract = {The transport of biomolecules across cell boundaries is central to cellular function. While structures of many membrane channels are known, the permeation mechanism is known only for a select few. Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computational method that can provide an accurate description of permeation events at the atomic level, which is required for understanding the transport mechanism. However, due to the relatively short time scales accessible to this method, it is of limited utility. Here, we present a method for all-atom simulation of electric field-driven transport of large solutes through membrane channels, which in tens of nanoseconds can provide a realistic account of a permeation event that would require a millisecond simulation using conventional MD. In this method, the average distribution of the electrostatic potential in a membrane channel under a transmembrane bias of interest is determined first from an all-atom MD simulation. This electrostatic potential, defined on a grid, is subsequently applied to a charged solute to steer its permeation through the membrane channel. We apply this method to investigate permeation of DNA strands, DNA hairpins, and alpha-helical peptides through alpha-hemolysin. To test the accuracy of the method, we computed the relative permeation rates of DNA strands having different sequences and global orientations. The results of the G-SMD simulations were found to be in good agreement in experiment.},

abstract = {We have used membrane surface charge to modulate the structural dynamics of an integral membrane protein, phospholamban (PLB), and thereby its functional inhibition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA). It was previously shown by electron paramagnetic resonance, in vesicles of neutral lipids, that the PLB cytoplasmic domain is in equilibrium between an ordered T state and a dynamically disordered R state and that phosphorylation of PLB increases the R state and relieves SERCA inhibition, suggesting that R is less inhibitory. Here, we sought to control the T/R equilibrium by an alternative means-varying the lipid headgroup charge, thus perturbing the electrostatic interaction of PLB's cationic cytoplasmic domain with the membrane surface. We resolved the T and R states not only by electron paramagnetic resonance in the absence of SERCA but also by time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer from SERCA to PLB, thus probing directly the SERCA-PLB complex. Compared to neutral lipids, anionic lipids increased both the T population and SERCA inhibition, while cationic lipids had the opposite effects. In contrast to conventional models, decreased inhibition was not accompanied by decreased binding. We conclude that PLB binds to SERCA in two distinct structural states of the cytoplasmic domain: an inhibitory T state that interacts strongly with the membrane surface and a less inhibitory R state that interacts more strongly with the anionic SERCA cytoplasmic domain. Modulating membrane surface charge provides an effective way of investigating the correlation between structural dynamics and function of integral membrane proteins.},

abstract = {Electric fields promote pore formation in both biological and model membranes. We clamped unmodified planar bilayers at 150-550 mV to monitor transient single pores for a long period of time. We observed fast transitions between different conductance levels reflecting opening and closing of metastable lipid pores. Although mean lifetime of the pores was 3 +/- 0.8 ms (250 mV), some pores remained open for up to approximately 1 s. The mean amplitude of conductance fluctuations (approximately 500 pS) was independent of voltage and close for bilayers of different area (40,000 and 10 microm(2)), indicating the local nature of the conductive defects. The distribution of pore conductance was rather broad (dispersion of approximately 250 pS). Based on the conductance value and its dependence of the ion size, the radius of the average pore was estimated as approximately 1 nm. Short bursts of conductance spikes (opening and closing of pores) were often separated by periods of background conductance. Within the same burst the conductance between spikes was indistinguishable from the background. The mean time interval between spikes in the burst was much smaller than that between adjacent bursts. These data indicate that opening and closing of lipidic pores proceed through some electrically invisible (silent) pre-pores. Similar pre-pore defects and metastable conductive pores might be involved in remodeling of cell membranes in different biologically relevant processes.},

Despite the importance of PI(4)P in Golgi trafficking and its manipulation by pathogens, the structural bases for PI(4)P-dependent membrane recruitment remain poorly defined. Here, we determined the crystal structure of a DrrA fragment including the P4M domain in complex with dibutyl PI(4)P and investigated the determinants of phosphoinositide recognition and membrane targeting. Headgroup recognition involves an elaborate network of direct and water-mediated interactions with basic and polar residues in the context of a deep, constrictive binding pocket. An adjacent hydrophobic helical element packs against the acyl chains and inserts robustly into PI(4)P-containing monolayers.

On the basis of their differential blockade currents, we can rapidly discriminate between both single- and double-stranded nucleic-acid molecules, as well as separate purine-based homopolymers from pyrimidine-based homopolymers. Molecule identification is facilitated through the application of high voltages ( approximately 600 mV), which contribute to the entropic stretching of these highly flexible molecules. This striking sensitivity to relatively small differences in the underlying polymer structure greatly improves the prospects for using nanopore-based devices for DNA or RNA mapping.},

abstract = {The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) serves as the major pore for metabolites and electrolytes in the outer mitochondrial membrane. To refine our understanding of ion permeation through this channel we performed an extensive Brownian (BD) and molecular dynamics (MD) study on the mouse VDAC isoform 1 wild-type and mutants (K20E, D30K, K61E, E158K and K252E). The selectivity and the conductance of the wild-type and of the variant channels computed from the BD trajectories are in agreement with experimental data. The calculated selectivity is shown to be very sensitive to slight conformational changes which may have some bearing on the variability of the selectivity values measured on the VDAC open state. The MD and BD free energy profiles of the ion permeation suggest that the pore region comprising the N-terminal helix and the barrel band encircling it predominantly controls the ion transport across the channel. The overall 12 $\mu$s BD and 0.9 $\mu$s MD trajectories of the mouse VDAC isoform 1 wild-type and mutants feature no distinct pathways for ion diffusion and no long-lived ion-protein interactions. The dependence of ion distribution in the wild-type channel with the salt concentration can be explained by an ionic screening of the permanent charges of the protein arising from the pore. Altogether these results bolster the role of electrostatic features of the pore as the main determinant of VDAC selectivity towards inorganic anions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Recent experiments [Kim JS, Wu Z, Morrow AR, Yethiraj A, Yethiraj A (2012) J Phys Chem B 116(39):12007-12013] have found that the self-diffusion of water (Dw) can either be enhanced or suppressed around CsI and NaCl, respectively, relative to that of neat water. Here we show that unlike classical empirical potentials, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations successfully reproduce the qualitative trends observed experimentally. These types of phenomena have often been rationalized in terms of the "structure-making" or "structure-breaking" effects of different ions on the solvent, although the microscopic origins of these features have remained elusive. Rather than disrupting the network in a significant manner, the electrolytes studied here cause rather subtle changes in both structural and dynamical properties of water. In particular, we show that water in the ab initio molecular dynamics simulations is characterized by dynamic heterogeneity, which turns out to be critical in reproducing the experimental trends.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are carried out to investigate the permeation of nanometer-sized cylindrical pores connecting two reservoirs, by water molecules and by a reference Lennard-Jones fluid. Water molecules penetrate a channel of fixed length only beyond a minimum radius. Near threshold, permeation is found to be intermittent and sensitive to other physical parameters, including the polarizability of the medium (e.g., a cell membrane) embedding the channel. Once the molecules fill the pore, the confined water exhibits properties (mean density, diffusivity, hydrogen bonding) surprisingly close to those of the bulk. The intermittent behavior near the threshold is analyzed in terms of a Landau-like grand potential regarded as a function of the pore occupancy. The grand potential, which is determined using a biased sampling technique, generally exhibits two minima, associated with the “empty” and “filled” states, separated by a potential barrier (transition state). No intermittent filling of identical pores is observed in the possible case of the reference Lennard-Jones fluid over a wide range of physical conditions, pointing to the specific role of hydrogen bonding for intermittent behavior. A careful analysis of the MD-generated configurations shows that the filled state nucleates around a chain of hydrogen-bonded molecules spanning the pore. © 2003 American Institute of Physics. © 2003 American Institute of Physics},

abstract = {Enteropathogenic bacteria, exemplified by Escherichia coli, rely on acid-resistance systems (ARs) to survive the acidic environment of the stomach. AR3 consumes intracellular protons through decarboxylation of arginine (Arg) in the cytoplasm and exchange of the reaction product agmatine (Agm) with extracellular Arg. The latter process is mediated by the Arg:Agm antiporter AdiC, which is activated in response to acidic pH and remains fully active at pH 6.0 and below. Despite our knowledge of structural information, the molecular mechanism by which AdiC senses acidic pH remains completely unknown. Relying on alanine-scanning mutagenesis and an in vitro proteoliposome-based transport assay, we have identified Tyr74 as a critical pH sensor in AdiC. The AdiC variant Y74A exhibited robust transport activity at all pH values examined while maintaining stringent substrate specificity for Arg:Agm. Replacement of Tyr74 by Phe, but not by any other amino acid, led to the maintenance of pH-dependent substrate transport. These observations, in conjunction with structural information, identify a working model for pH-induced activation of AdiC in which a closed conformation is disrupted by cation-$\pi$ interactions between proton and the aromatic side chain of Tyr74.},

abstract = {Improving our understanding of the mechanisms and effects of anesthetics is a critically important part of neuroscience. The currently dominant theory is that anesthetics and similar molecules act by binding to Cys-loop receptors in the postsynaptic terminal of nerve cells and potentiate or inhibit their function. Although structures for some of the most important mammalian channels have still not been determined, a number of important results have been derived from work on homologous cationic channels in bacteria. However, partly due to the lack of a nervous system in bacteria, there are a number of questions about how these results relate to higher organisms. The recent determination of a structure of the eukaryotic chloride channel, GluCl, is an important step toward accurate modeling of mammalian channels, because it is more similar in function to human Cys-loop receptors such as GABAAR or GlyR. One potential issue with using GluCl to model other receptors is the presence of the large ligand ivermectin (IVM) positioned between all five subunits. Here, we have performed a series of microsecond molecular simulations to study how the dynamics and structure of GluCl change in the presence versus absence of IVM. When the ligand is removed, subunits move at least 2 \AA closer to each other compared to simulations with IVM bound. In addition, the pore radius shrinks to 1.2 \AA, all of which appears to support a model where IVM binding between subunits stabilizes an open state, and that the relaxed nonIVM conformations might be suitable for modeling other channels. Interestingly, the presence of IVM also has an effect on the structure of the important loop C located at the neurotransmitter-binding pocket, which might help shed light on its partial agonist behavior. © 2013 Biophysical Society.},

Discrete conductance steps are observed, reflecting voltage-dependent transmembrane channels. These exist in clusters which are activated by voltage. After activation, channels close with increasing potentials and reopen reversibly at lower voltage. Depending on the sign of the potential, two distinct closed states of the pores are observed. Cooperative interactions, hysteresis effects, relaxation times, and values of channel conductance depend on cluster size. These properties provide the reference data for the reconstitution of membrane function from individual components. Planar bilayers were formed from vesicles containing either solubilized matrix protein in a homogeneous trimeric state or bacterial glycolipid (lipopolysaccharide), or both. Activation of channel conductance required the presence of glycolipid and the formation of channel clusters, leading to conductance properties of the channels closely resembling those observed in native outer membranes. At very low concentrations of trimers, irreversible association to clusters by lateral diffusion was observed. Nearly quantitative recoveries of channels allowed the assignment of three pores per trimer.},

abstract = {The 5-HT(3) receptor is a pentameric serotonin-gated ion channel, which mediates rapid excitatory neurotransmission and is the target of a therapeutically important class of anti-emetic drugs, such as granisetron. We report crystal structures of a binding protein engineered to recognize the agonist serotonin and the antagonist granisetron with affinities comparable to the 5-HT(3) receptor. In the serotonin-bound structure, we observe hydrophilic interactions with loop E-binding site residues, which might enable transitions to channel opening. In the granisetron-bound structure, we observe a critical cation-$\pi$ interaction between the indazole moiety of the ligand and a cationic centre in loop D, which is uniquely present in the 5-HT(3) receptor. We use a series of chemically tuned granisetron analogues to demonstrate the energetic contribution of this electrostatic interaction to high-affinity ligand binding in the human 5-HT(3) receptor. Our study offers the first structural perspective on recognition of serotonin and antagonism by anti-emetics in the 5-HT(3) receptor.},

Although thermal fluctuations significantly reduce the absolute values of activation barriers, DeltaG*, we find a scaling exponent (v = 1.9 +/- 0.1) that agrees within statistical limits with the saddle-point approximation, DeltaG* proportional to D-2. Devising a method to measure a microscopic analogue of the contact angle theta from simulations, we find good agreement with the continuum prediction, DeltaG* proportional to 1/cos theta. Combining the known result for the magnitude of the activation barrier and the evaporation rate of molecular water in a specified molecular confinement (Leung, K.; Luzar, A.; Bratko, D. Phys. Rev.

Here we show that the prokaryotic homolog ELIC also is activated by GABA and is modulated by benzodiazepines with effects comparable to those at GABA(A) receptors. Crystal structures reveal important features of GABA recognition and indicate that benzodiazepines, depending on their concentration, occupy two possible sites in ELIC. An intrasubunit site is adjacent to the GABA-recognition site but faces the channel vestibule. A second intersubunit site partially overlaps with the GABA site and likely corresponds to a low-affinity benzodiazepine-binding site in GABA(A) receptors that mediates inhibitory effects of the benzodiazepine flurazepam.

abstract = {The creation of switchable and tunable nanodevices displaying transport properties similar to those observed in biological pores poses a major challenge in molecular nanotechnology. Here, we describe the construction of a fully "abiotic" nanodevice whose transport properties can be accurately controlled by manipulating the proton concentration in the surrounding environment. The ionic current switching characteristics displayed by the nanochannels resemble the typical behavior observed in many biological channels that fulfill key pH-dependent transport functions in living organisms, that is, the nanochannel can be switched from an "off" state to an "on" state in response to a pH drop. The construction of such a chemical nanoarchitecture required the integration of stable and ductile macromolecular building blocks constituted of pH-responsive poly(4-vinyl pyridine) brushes into solid state nanopores that could act as gate-keepers managing and constraining the flow of ionic species through the confined environment. In this context, we envision that the integration of environmental stimuli-responsive brushes into solid-state nanochannels would provide a plethora of new chemical alternatives for molecularly design robust signal-responsive "abiotic" devices mimicking the function of proton-gated ion channels commonly encountered in biological membranes.},

abstract = {A Flory-Huggins type lattice approach is used to describe theoretically a heterogeneous mixture composed of an ionic liquid (IL) and a nonionic liquid (nIL). It is analyzed, how the behavior of the system depends on the difference in the affinities of the cations and the anions to the neutral molecules (i.e., on the "amphiphilicity" of the IL with respect to the nIL). It is proved that if the difference in the affinities is not large, two macrophases coexist in the mixture; if the difference exceeds a certain threshold value, the mixture becomes microheterogeneous: depending on its composition, it can turn either into ion clusters dispersed over the phase having low concentration of ions, or into clusters of neutral molecules dispersed over the phase having high concentration of ions. If the system is not close to the critical point, the ion clusters can be only small: the maximal ratio of their diameter to an ion diameter is of the order of ten; however, the clusters of nonionic molecules can be large, if the difference in the affinities has a certain value. It is predicted also that cavities can nucleate inside an IL, and clusters of ions can appear in a saturated vapor of an IL.},

abstract = {The mechanism of sorting, to the outer membrane, of the 325-residue Escherichia coli protein OmpA has been investigated. It is thought to traverse the membrane eight times in antiparallel beta-strands, forming an amphiphilic beta-barrel which encompasses residues 1 to about 170; the COOH-terminal moiety is periplasmic. A mutant, carrying the substitutions Leu164----Pro and Val166----Asp within the last beta-strand (residues 160-170), has been described which was unable to assemble in the membrane (Klose, M., MacIntyre, S., Schwarz, H., and Henning, U. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 13297-13302). Linkers were inserted between the codons for residues 164 and 165 of the mutant protein. Of 13 different genes recovered, five encoded proteins which had regained the ability to assemble in the membrane. The properties of the mutant proteins, together with a structure prediction method, indicate the following rules for the final beta-strand to be compatible with, or possibly initiate, membrane insertion: (i) it must be amphiphilic or hydrophobic while its primary structure as such is fairly unimportant, (ii) it must extend over at least 9 residues, and (iii) it must not contain a proline residue around its center. One of the genes recovered coded for OmpA up to residue 164 and then followed by 10 linker-encoded residues. This 174-residue polypeptide was assembled in the membrane but did not, in contrast to all other proteins, expose sites sensitive to trypsin at the inner face of the membrane. This behavior agrees perfectly well with the OmpA model.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Porins are channel-forming membrane proteins that confer solute permeability to the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. In Escherichia coli, major nonspecific porins are matrix porin (OmpF) and osmoporin (OmpC), which show high sequence homology. In response to high osmolarity of the medium, OmpC is expressed at the expense of OmpF porin. Here, we study osmoporin of the pathogenic Klebsiella pneumoniae (OmpK36), which shares 87% sequence identity with E. coliOmpC in an attempt to establish why osmoporin is best suited to function at high osmotic pressure. RESULTS: The crystal structure of OmpK36 has been determined to a resolution of 3.2 A by molecular replacement with the model of OmpF. The structure of OmpK36 closely resembles that of the search model. The homotrimeric structure is composed of three hollow 16-stranded antiparallel beta barrels, each delimiting a separate pore. Most insertions and deletions with respect to OmpF are found in the loops that protrude towards the cell exterior. A characteristic ten-residue insertion in loop 4 contributes to the subunit interface. At the pore constriction, the replacement of an alanine by a tyrosine residue does not alter the pore profile of OmpK36 in comparison with OmpF because of the different course of the mainchain. Functionally, as characterized in lipid bilayers and liposomes, OmpK36 resembles OmpC with decreased conductance and increased cation selectivity in comparison with OmpF. CONCLUSIONS: The osmoporin structure suggests that not an altered pore size but an increase in charge density is the basis for the distinct physico-chemical properties of this porin that are relevant for its preferential expression at high osmotic strength.},

abstract = {Measurements of voltage changes in response to charge separation within membrane proteins can offer fundamental information on mechanisms of charge transport and displacement processes. A recent example is provided by studies of cytochrome c oxidase. However, the interpretation of the observed voltage changes in terms of the number of charge equivalents and transfer distances is far from being trivial or unique. Using continuum approaches to describe the voltage generation may involve significant uncertainties and reliable microscopic simulations are not yet available. Here, we attempt to solve this problem by using a coarse-grained model of membrane proteins, which includes an explicit description of the membrane, the electrolytes, and the electrodes. The model evaluates the gating charges and the electrode potentials (c.f. measured voltage) upon charge transfer within the protein. The accuracy of the model is evaluated by a comparison of measured voltage changes associated with electron and proton transfer in bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers to those calculated using our coarse-grained model. The calculations reproduce the experimental observations and thus indicate that the method is of general use. Interestingly, it is found that charge-separation processes with different spatial directions (but the same distance perpendicular to the membrane) can give similar observed voltage changes, which indicates that caution should be exercised when using simplified interpretation of the relationship between charge displacement and voltage changes.},

We demonstrate that the ionic current through the engineered Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A, MspA, has the ability to distinguish all four DNA nucleotides and resolve single-nucleotides in single-stranded DNA when double-stranded DNA temporarily holds the nucleotides in the pore constriction. Passing DNA with a series of double-stranded sections through MspA provides proof of principle of a simple DNA sequencing method using a nanopore.

abstract = {The K+ selectivity filter catalyses the dehydration, transfer and rehydration of a K+ ion in about ten nanoseconds. This physical process is central to the production of electrical signals in biology. Here we show how nearly diffusion-limited rates are achieved, by analysing ion conduction and the corresponding crystallographic ion distribution in the selectivity filter of the KcsA K+ channel. Measurements with K+ and its slightly larger analogue, Rb+, lead us to conclude that the selectivity filter usually contains two K+ ions separated by one water molecule. The two ions move in a concerted fashion between two configurations, K+-water-K+-water (1,3 configuration) and water-K+-water-K+ (2,4 configuration), until a third ion enters, displacing the ion on the opposite side of the queue. For K+, the energy difference between the 1,3 and 2,4 configurations is close to zero, the condition of maximum conduction rate. The energetic balance between these configurations is a clear example of evolutionary optimization of protein function.},

abstract = {In the current report, we provide a quantitative analysis of the convergence of the sampling of conformational space accomplished in molecular dynamics simulations of membrane proteins of duration in the order of 10 nanoseconds. A set of proteins of diverse size and topology is considered, ranging from helical pores such as gramicidin and small beta-barrels such as OmpT, to larger and more complex structures such as rhodopsin and FepA. Principal component analysis of the C(alpha)-atom trajectories was employed to assess the convergence of the conformational sampling in both the transmembrane domains and the whole proteins, while the time-dependence of the average structure was analyzed to obtain single-domain information. The membrane-embedded regions, particularly those of small or structurally simple proteins, were found to achieve reasonable convergence. By contrast, extra-membranous domains lacking secondary structure are often markedly under-sampled, exhibiting a continuous structural drift. This drift results in a significant imprecision in the calculated B-factors, which detracts from any quantitative comparison to experimental data. In view of such limitations, we suggest that similar analyses may be valuable in simulation studies of membrane protein dynamics, in order to attach a level of confidence to any biologically relevant observations.},

abstract = {We present the first atomic-resolution observations of permeation and gating in a K(+) channel, based on molecular dynamics simulations of the Kv1.2 pore domain. Analysis of hundreds of simulated permeation events revealed a detailed conduction mechanism, resembling the Hodgkin-Keynes "knock-on" model, in which translocation of two selectivity filter-bound ions is driven by a third ion; formation of this knock-on intermediate is rate determining. In addition, at reverse or zero voltages, we observed pore closure by a novel "hydrophobic gating" mechanism: A dewetting transition of the hydrophobic pore cavity-fastest when K(+) was not bound in selectivity filter sites nearest the cavity-caused the open, conducting pore to collapse into a closed, nonconducting conformation. Such pore closure corroborates the idea that voltage sensors can act to prevent pore collapse into the intrinsically more stable, closed conformation, and it further suggests that molecular-scale dewetting facilitates a specific biological function: K(+) channel gating. Existing experimental data support our hypothesis that hydrophobic gating may be a fundamental principle underlying the gating of voltage-sensitive K(+) channels. We suggest that hydrophobic gating explains, in part, why diverse ion channels conserve hydrophobic pore cavities, and we speculate that modulation of cavity hydration could enable structural determination of both open and closed channels.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the properties of pores formed by OmpF porin from Escherichia coli, based on a molecular dynamics simulation of the OmpF trimer, 318 palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine lipids, 27 Na+ ions, and 12,992 water molecules. After equilibration and a nanosecond production run, the OmpF trimer exhibits a C-alpha root mean square deviation from the crystal structure of 0.23 nm and a stable secondary structure. No evidence is found for large-scale motions of the L3 loop. We investigate the pore dimensions, conductance, and the properties of water inside the pore. This water forms a complicated pattern, even when averaged over 1 ns of simulation time. Around the pore constriction zone the water dipoles are highly structured in the plane of the membrane, oriented by the strong transversal electric field. In addition, there is a net orientation along the pore axis pointing from the extracellular to the intracellular side of the bilayer. The diffusion coefficients of water inside the pore are greatly reduced compared to bulk. We compare our results to results from model pores (Breed et al., 1996. Biophys.

abstract = {Advances in modern computational methods and technology make it possible to carry out extensive molecular dynamics simulations of complex membrane proteins based on detailed atomic models. The ultimate goal of such detailed simulations is to produce trajectories in which the behavior of the system is as realistic as possible. A critical aspect that requires consideration in the case of biological membrane systems is the existence of a net electric potential difference across the membrane. For meaningful computations, it is important to have well validated methodologies for incorporating the latter in molecular dynamics simulations. A widely used treatment of the membrane potential in molecular dynamics consists of applying an external uniform electric field E perpendicular to the membrane. The field acts on all charged particles throughout the simulated system, and the resulting applied membrane potential V is equal to the applied electric field times the length of the periodic cell in the direction perpendicular to the membrane. A series of test simulations based on simple membrane-slab models are carried out to clarify the consequences of the applied field. These illustrative tests demonstrate that the constant-field method is a simple and valid approach for accounting for the membrane potential in molecular dynamics studies of biomolecular systems.

Emerging structural information and functional studies have revealed distinctive features of metal transport. Among these are the relevance of multifaceted events involving metal transfer among participating proteins, the importance of coordination geometry at transmembrane transport sites, and the presence of the largely irreversible steps associated with vectorial transport.

In the three other methods, e is evaluated from the probability distribution p( M) of the dipole moment norm. This distribution is itself evaluated in three different ways: (i) from multiple simulations involving a M-dependent biasing potential (umbrella-sampling method), (ii) from multiple simulations involving a constrained dipole moment norm (M-constraint method),or (iii) from fitting of incomplete p( M) estimates to a Maxwell distribution (fitting method). The four methods are shown to converge to an identical estimate of e=61+-1 for SPC water (256 molecules, reaction-field electrostatics). The convergence properties, advantages, and drawbacks of the different methods are analyzed in detail.},

abstract = {Anion/cation selectivity is a critical property of ion channels and underpins their physiological function. Recently, there have been numerous mutagenesis studies, which have mapped sites within the ion channel-forming segments of ligand-gated ion channels that are determinants of the ion selectivity. Site-directed mutations to specific amino acids within or flanking the M2 transmembrane segments of the anion-selective glycine, GABAA and GABAC receptors and the cation-selective nicotinic acetylcholine and serotonin (type 3) receptors have revealed discrete, equivalent regions within the ion channel that form the principal selectivity filter, leading to plausible molecular mechanisms and mathematical models to describe how ions preferentially permeate these channels. In particular, the dominant factor determining anion/cation selectivity seems to be the sign and exposure of charged amino acids lining the selectivity filter region of the open channel. In addition, the minimum pore diameter, which can be influenced by the presence of a local proline residue, also makes a contribution to such ion selectivity in LGICs with smaller diameters increasing anion/cation selectivity and larger ones decreasing it. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) and 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT(3)) receptors are cation-selective ion channels of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) superfamily. Multiple lines of evidence adduced over the last 30 years indicate that the lining of the channel of such receptors is formed by the alpha-helical second transmembrane (TM2) domain and flanking sequences contributed by each of the five subunits present within the receptor complex. Specific amino acid residues within, and adjacent to, the TM2 domain influence single channel conductance, ion selectivity, and other aspects of receptor function that include gating and desensitization. However, more recent work has revealed important structural determinants of single channel conductance and ion selectivity that are not associated with the TM2 domain. Direct experimental evidence indicates that the intracellular domain of eukaryotic pLGICs, in particular a region of the loop linking TM3 and TM4 termed the membrane-associated (MA) stretch, exerts a strong influence upon ion channel biophysics. Moreover, recent computational approaches, complemented by experimentation, implicate the extracellular domain as an additional important determinant of ion conduction. This brief review describes how our knowledge of ion conduction and selectivity in cation-selective pLGICs has evolved beyond TM2.},

Therefore, in an effort to relate electrophysiological measurements on MscS and properties of the MscS crystal conformation, we report here MscS's response to voltage and pressure as determined by patch-clamp experiments, as well as MscS electrostatics and transport properties as determined through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the protein embedded in a lipid bilayer, a 224,000-atom system. The experiments reveal that MscS is a slightly anion-selective channel with a conductance of approximately 1 ns, activated by pressure and inactivated in a voltage-dependent manner. On the other hand, the simulations, covering over 200 ns and including biasing electrostatic potentials, show that MscS restrained to the crystal conformation exhibits low conductance; unrestrained it increases the channel radius upon application of a large electrostatic bias and exhibits then ion conduction that matches experimentally determined conductances. The simulated conductance stems mainly from Cl- ions.},

Recently, a much simpler alternative for PMF calculations has become available, namely, using Jarzynski's equality in steered molecular dynamics simulations. So far, there have been a few comparisons of the two methods and mostly in simple systems that do not reflect the complexities of protein-ligand systems. Here, we use both methods to calculate the PMF for ion permeation and ligand binding to ion channels. Comparison of results indicate that Jarzynski's method suffers from relaxation problems in complex systems and would require much longer simulation times to yield reliable PMFs for protein-ligand systems.},

abstract = {We suggest that bubbles are the bistable hydrophobic gates responsible for the on-off transitions of single channel currents. In this view, many types of channels gate by the same physical mechanism-dewetting by capillary evaporation-but different types of channels use different sensors to modulate hydrophobic properties of the channel wall and thereby trigger and control bubbles and gating. Spontaneous emptying of channels has been seen in many simulations. Because of the physics involved, such phase transitions are inherently sensitive, unstable threshold phenomena that are difficult to simulate reproducibly and thus convincingly. We present a thermodynamic analysis of a bubble gate using morphometric density functional theory of classical (not quantum) mechanics. Thermodynamic analysis of phase transitions is generally more reproducible and less sensitive to details than simulations. Anesthetic actions of inert gases-and their interactions with hydrostatic pressure (e.g., nitrogen narcosis)-can be easily understood by actions on bubbles. A general theory of gas anesthesia may involve bubbles in channels. Only experiments can show whether, or when, or which channels actually use bubbles as hydrophobic gates: direct observation of bubbles in channels is needed. Existing experiments show thin gas layers on hydrophobic surfaces in water and suggest that bubbles nearly exist in bulk water.},

This exposed the cytoplasmic surface of the RMs, with its attached ribosomes, to the cis chamber. Addition of 100 microM puromycin to the cis side caused a large increase in membrane conductance, presumably the result of puromycin-induced clearance of nascent protein chains from the lumen of protein-conducting channels. When puromycin was added at low concentrations (0.33 microM), single channels of 220 pS were observed. These closed when the salt concentration was raised to levels at which ribosomes detach from the membrane (150-400 mM), indicating that the attached ribosome keeps the channel in an open conformation.

This structure reveals architectural elements unique to eukaryotic Cys-loop receptors, explains the mechanistic consequences of multiple human disease mutations and shows an unexpected structural role for a conserved N-linked glycan. The receptor was crystallized bound to a previously unknown agonist, benzamidine, opening a new avenue for the rational design of GABAAR modulators. The channel region forms a closed gate at the base of the pore, representative of a desensitized state.

abstract = {Mechanosensitive channel large (MscL) encodes the large conductance mechanosensitive channel of the Escherichia coli inner membrane that protects bacteria from lysis upon osmotic shock. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of MscL gating, we have comprehensively substituted Gly(22) with all other common amino acids. Gly(22) was highlighted in random mutagenesis screens of E. coli MscL (, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 95:11471-11475). By analogy to the recently published MscL structure from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (, Science. 282:2220-2226), Gly(22) is buried within the constriction that closes the pore. Substituting Gly(22) with hydrophilic residues decreased the threshold pressure at which channels opened and uncovered an intermediate subconducting state. In contrast, hydrophobic substitutions increased the threshold pressure. Although hydrophobic substitutions had no effect on growth, similar to the effect of an MscL deletion, channel hyperactivity caused by hydrophilic substitutions correlated with decreased proliferation. These results suggest a model for gating in which Gly(22) moves from a hydrophobic, and through a hydrophilic, environment upon transition from the closed to open conformation.},

abstract = {The evolutionary trajectory of a protein through sequence space is constrained by its function. Collections of sequence homologs record the outcomes of millions of evolutionary experiments in which the protein evolves according to these constraints. Deciphering the evolutionary record held in these sequences and exploiting it for predictive and engineering purposes presents a formidable challenge. The potential benefit of solving this challenge is amplified by the advent of inexpensive high-throughput genomic sequencing.
        In this paper we ask whether we can infer evolutionary constraints from a set of sequence homologs of a protein. The challenge is to distinguish true co-evolution couplings from the noisy set of observed correlations. We address this challenge using a maximum entropy model of the protein sequence, constrained by the statistics of the multiple sequence alignment, to infer residue pair couplings. Surprisingly, we find that the strength of these inferred couplings is an excellent predictor of residue-residue proximity in folded structures. Indeed, the top-scoring residue couplings are sufficiently accurate and well-distributed to define the 3D protein fold with remarkable accuracy.
        We quantify this observation by computing, from sequence alone, all-atom 3D structures of fifteen test proteins from different fold classes, ranging in size from 50 to 260 residues., including a G-protein coupled receptor. These blinded inferences are de novo, i.e., they do not use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The co-evolution signals provide sufficient information to determine accurate 3D protein structure to 2.7–4.8 \AA C$\alpha$-RMSD error relative to the observed structure, over at least two-thirds of the protein (method called EVfold, details at http://EVfold.org). This discovery provides insight into essential interactions constraining protein evolution and will facilitate a comprehensive survey of the universe of protein structures, new strategies in protein and drug design, and the identification of functional genetic variants in normal and disease genomes.},

We describe the structure of a bacterial homolog (KpBest) of hBest1 and functional characterizations of both channels. KpBest is a pentamer that forms a five-helix transmembrane pore, closed by three rings of conserved hydrophobic residues, and has a cytoplasmic cavern with a restricted exit. From electrophysiological analysis of structure-inspired mutations in KpBest and hBest1, we find a sensitive control of ion selectivity in the bestrophins, including reversal of anion/cation selectivity, and dramatic activation by mutations at the cytoplasmic exit. A homology model of hBest1 shows the locations of disease-causing mutations and suggests possible roles in regulation.
Insight into a retinal degeneration disease
Human bestrophin 1 (hBest1) is a membrane protein that forms a chloride channel in the retinal pigment epithelium. Mutations in hBest1 can lead to a retinal degeneration disease known as Best disease. Yang et al. describe the structure of KpBest, a bacterial homolog of hBest1. KpBest forms a pentamer with an ion channel at its center. In contrast to hBest1, KpBest1 is a sodium channel. The structure suggests a mechanism for ion selectivity that was confirmed by mutagenesis of KpBest and hBest1. A model of the hBest1 channel structure based on the KpBest structure reveals how mutations cause disease.

A double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule is trapped when the electric field near the nanopore attracts and immobilizes a non-end segment of the molecule across the nanopore orifice without inducing a folded molecule translocation. In this demonstration of the phenomenon, the ionic current through the nanopore decreases when the dsDNA molecule is trapped by the nanopore. By contrast, a translocating dsDNA molecule under the same conditions causes an ionic current increase.

abstract = {Corynebacterium jeikeium, a resident of human skin, is often associated with multidrug resistant nosocomial infections in immunodepressed patients. C. jeikeium K411 belongs to mycolic acid-containing actinomycetes, the mycolata and contains a channel-forming protein as judged from reconstitution experiments with artificial lipid bilayer experiments. The channel-forming protein was present in detergent treated cell walls and in extracts of whole cells using organic solvents. A gene coding for a 40 amino acid long polypeptide possibly responsible for the pore-forming activity was identified in the known genome of C. jeikeium by its similar chromosomal localization to known porH and porA genes of other Corynebacterium strains. The gene jk0268 was expressed in a porin deficient Corynebacterium glutamicum strain. For purification temporarily histidine-tailed or with a GST-tag at the N-terminus, the homogeneous protein caused channel-forming activity with an average conductance of 1.25 nS in 1M KCl identical to the channels formed by the detergent extracts. Zero-current membrane potential measurements of the voltage dependent channel implied selectivity for anions. This preference is according to single-channel analysis caused by some excess of cationic charges located in the channel lumen formed by oligomeric alpha-helical wheels. The channel has a suggested diameter of 1.4 nm as judged from the permeability of different sized hydrated anions using the Renkin correction factor. Surprisingly, the genome of C. jeikeium contained only one gene coding for a cell wall channel of the PorA/PorH type found in other Corynebacterium species. The possible evolutionary relationship between the heterooligomeric channels formed by certain Corynebacterium strains and the homooligomeric pore of C. jeikeium is discussed.},

abstract = {Successive parameterizations of the GROMOS force field have been used successfully to simulate biomolecular systems over a long period of time. The continuing expansion of computational power with time makes it possible to compute ever more properties for an increasing variety of molecular systems with greater precision. This has led to recurrent parameterizations of the GROMOS force field all aimed at achieving better agreement with experimental data. Here we report the results of the latest, extensive reparameterization of the GROMOS force field. In contrast to the parameterization of other biomolecular force fields, this parameterization of the GROMOS force field is based primarily on reproducing the free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation for a range of compounds. This approach was chosen because the relative free enthalpy of solvation between polar and apolar environments is a key property in many biomolecular processes of interest, such as protein folding, biomolecular association, membrane formation, and transport over membranes. The newest parameter sets, 53A5 and 53A6, were optimized by first fitting to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of pure liquids of a range of small polar molecules and the solvation free enthalpies of amino acid analogs in cyclohexane (53A5). The partial charges were then adjusted to reproduce the hydration free enthalpies in water (53A6). Both parameter sets are fully documented, and the differences between these and previous parameter sets are discussed.},

abstract = {As background for appreciating the still-unsolved problems of monovalent anion selectivity, we summarize the facts and intepretations that seem reasonably well established. In section II we saw that specific effects of monovalent anions on biological and physical systems define qualitative patterns, in that only certain sequences of anion effects are observed. For example, the 4 halides can be permitted on paper as 4! = 24 sequences, yet only 5 of these sequences have been observed in nature as potency sequences. In addition, there are quantitative regularities in anion potency that permit the construction of so-called empirical selectivity isotherms (Figs. 4 and 13). That is, a given potency sequence is found to be associated with only a certain modest range of selectivity ratios. The sequences and isotherms apply to effects with a nonequilibrium component (e.g., permeability and conductance sequences) as well as to purely equilibrium effects. Since students of cation selectivity have had difficulty accepting this conclusion, we discuss the reasons why it is not as paradoxical as it at first seems. In sections III and IV we develop four theoretical models to account for the observed anion potency sequences as sequences of equilibrium binding energies. Two of these models involve calculation of electrostatic binding energies between anions and monopolar or dipolar cationic sites, assuming anions as well as sites to be rigid and nonpolarizable. The other two models use thermochemically measured binding energies between anions and thealkali cations or occasionally alkaline-earth cations, which in fact approximate rigid, nonpolarizable spheres. All four models consider the anion selectivity pattern of a given cationic site to be determined by anion differences in the balance between hydration energies and ion-site binding energies. Site differences in anion selectivity pattern are attributed to site differences in radius, charge, coordination number, or dipole length. These models succeed in predicting all five observed selectivity sequences of the halides. The models predict in addition the possible existence of two further halide sequences that arise from very strong sites and that have not yet been observed in nature. For polyatomic anions the predictions agree approximately but not completely with observations. Thyroidlike systems, which greatly prefer iodide over other halides,re interpreted as having the weakest sites. Site hydration is predicted to affect the magnitude but not the sequence of potency ratios. For the thyroidlike systems, observed potency ratios are smaller than would be expected if anions were completely dehydrated at biological sites.},

abstract = {Nanopores in membranes have a range of potential applications. Biomimetic design of nanopores aims to mimic key functions of biological pores within a stable template structure. Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to test whether a simple $\beta$-barrel protein nanopore can be modified to incorporate a hydrophobic barrier to permeation. Simulations have been used to evaluate functional properties of such nanopores, using water flux as a proxy for ionic conductance. The behavior of these model pores has been characterized as a function of pore size and of the hydrophobicity of the amino acid side chains lining the narrow central constriction of the pore. Potential of mean force calculations have been used to calculate free energy landscapes for water and for ion permeation in selected models. These studies demonstrate that a hydrophobic barrier can indeed be designed into a $\beta$-barrel protein nanopore, and that the height of the barrier can be adjusted by modifying the number of consecutive rings of hydrophobic side chains. A hydrophobic barrier prevents both water and ion permeation even though the pore is sterically unoccluded. These results both provide insights into the nature of hydrophobic gating in biological pores and channels, and furthermore demonstrate that simple design features may be computationally transplanted into $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins to generate functionally complex nanopores.},

abstract = {Monolayer graphene is one of the most interesting materials applicable to next-generation electronic devices due to its transport properties. However, realization of graphene devices requires suitable nanoscale lithography as well as a method to open a band gap in monolayer graphene. Nanoscale hydrogenation and oxidation are promising methods to open an energy band gap by modification of surface structures and to fabricate nanostructures such as graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). Until now it has been difficult to fabricate nanoscale devices consisting of both hydrogenated and oxidized graphene because the hydrogenation of graphene requires a complicated process composed of large-scale chemical modification, nanoscale patterning, and etching. We report on nanoscale hydrogenation and oxidation of graphene under normal atmospheric conditions and at room temperature without etching, wet process, or even any gas treatment by controlling just an external bias through atomic force microscope lithography. Both the lithographically defined nanoscale hydrogenation and oxidation have been confirmed by micro-Raman spectroscopy measurements. Patterned hydrogenated and oxidized graphene show insulating behaviors, and their friction values are several times larger than those of graphene. These differences can be used for fabricating electronic or electromechanical devices based on graphene.},

@article{Tokman2013,
abstract = {Electroporation is the formation of permeabilizing structures in the cell membrane under the influence of an externally imposed electric field. The resulting increased permeability of the membrane enables a wide range of biological applications, including the delivery of normally excluded substances into cells. While electroporation is used extensively in biology, biotechnology, and medicine, its molecular mechanism is not well understood. This lack of knowledge limits the ability to control and fine-tune the process. In this article we propose a novel molecular mechanism for the electroporation of a lipid bilayer based on energetics analysis. Using molecular dynamics simulations we demonstrate that pore formation is driven by the reorganization of the interfacial water molecules. Our energetics analysis and comparisons of simulations with and without the lipid bilayer show that the process of poration is driven by field-induced reorganization of water dipoles at the water-lipid or water-vacuum interfaces into more energetically favorable configurations, with their molecular dipoles oriented in the external field. Although the contributing role of water in electroporation has been noted previously, here we propose that interfacial water molecules are the main players in the process, its initiators and drivers. The role of the lipid layer, to a first-order approximation, is then reduced to a relatively passive barrier. This new view of electroporation simplifies the study of the problem, and opens up new opportunities in both theoretical modeling of the process and experimental research to better control or to use it in new, innovative ways.},

abstract = {KcsA is a proton-activated, voltage-modulated K(+) channel that has served as the archetype pore domain in the Kv channel superfamily. Here, we have used synthetic antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) as crystallographic chaperones to determine the structure of full-length KcsA at 3.8 A, as well as that of its isolated C-terminal domain at 2.6 A. The structure of the full-length KcsA-Fab complex reveals a well-defined, 4-helix bundle that projects approximately 70 A toward the cytoplasm. This bundle promotes a approximately 15 degree bending in the inner bundle gate, tightening its diameter and shifting the narrowest point 2 turns of helix below. Functional analysis of the full-length KcsA-Fab complex suggests that the C-terminal bundle remains whole during gating. We suggest that this structure likely represents the physiologically relevant closed conformation of KcsA.},

abstract = {We described in two previous papers a method for the joint refinement of the structure of fluid bilayers using neutron and x-ray diffraction data (Wiener, M. C., and S. H. White 1991a, b. Biophys. J. 59: 162-173 and 174-185). An essential part of the method is the appropriate scaling of the diffraction data. Here we describe the scaling of the neutron data and the determination of the transbilayer distribution of double bonds in liquid-crystalline (L alpha phase) phospholipid bilayers of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC). The distribution was determined by neutron diffraction of oriented multilayers (66% RH) of DOPC specifically deuterated at the 9- and 10-position of both acyl chains. The double-bond distribution is described accurately by a pair of Gaussian functions each located at a position Zcc = 7.88 +/- 0.09 A from the bilayer center with 1/e-halfwidths of Acc = 4.29 +/- 0.16 A. Previously, we determined the transbilayer distribution of bromine atoms in a specifically halogenated lipid, 1-oleoyl-2-9,10-dibromostearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (OBPC), and showed it to be an isomorphous replacement for DOPC (Wiener, M. C., and S. H. White, 1991c. Biochemistry. In press). A comparison of the double-bond and bromine profiles indicates that the positions of the centers of the deuterated double bond and the brominated methylene Gaussian distributions are equal within experimental error and that each label undergoes similar average thermal motions with respect to the bilayer normal. The observation that the average position of a label on both acyl chains (the deuterated double bonds) is similar to the average position of a label on the 2-chain alone (the brominated methylenes) indicates that the maximum separation along the bilayer normal between the double bonds of the acyl chains is 1 A or less. The fully-resolved transbilayer water distribution, previously determined at lower resolution (Jacobs, R. E., and S. H. White. 1989. Biochemistry. 28:3421-3437), was obtained from the analysis of neutron diffraction data of DOPC hydrated with a D20/H20 mixture. The water distribution is described accurately by a pair of Gaussian functions each located at a position Zw = 22.51 +/- 0.77 A from the bilayer center with 1/e-half widths of Aw = 4.63 +/- 0.48A. We present the relative absolute neutron and x-ray structure factors of DOPC at 66% RH that will be used to solve the complete structure of DOPC which will be presented in a later paper of this series.},

abstract = {The lipid bilayer membranes are Nature's dynamic structural motifs that individualize cells and keep ions, proteins, biopolymers and metabolites confined in the appropriate location. The compartmentalization and isolation of these molecules from the external media facilitate the sophisticated functions and connections between the different biological processes accomplished by living organisms. However, cells require assistance from minimal energy shortcuts for the transport of molecules across membranes so that they can interact with the exterior and regulate their internal environments. Ion channels and pores stand out from all other possible transport mechanisms due to their high selectivity and efficiency in discriminating and transporting ions or molecules across membrane barriers. Nevertheless, the complexity of these smart "membrane holes" has driven researchers to develop simpler artificial structures with comparable performance to the natural systems. As a broad range of supramolecular interactions have emerged as efficient tools for the rational design and preparation of stable 3D superstructures, these results have stimulated the creativity of chemists to design synthetic mimics of natural active macromolecules and even to develop artificial structures with functions and properties. In this Account, we highlight results from our laboratories on the construction of artificial ion channel models that exploit the self-assembly of conformationally flat cyclic peptides (CPs) into supramolecular nanotubes. Because of the straightforward synthesis of the cyclic peptide monomers and the complete control over the internal diameter and external surface properties of the resulting hollow tubular suprastructure, CPs are the optimal candidates for the fabrication of ion channels. The ion channel activity and selective transport of small molecules by these structures are examples of the great potential that cyclic peptide nanotubes show for the construction of functional artificial transmembrane transporters. Our experience to date suggests that the next steps for achieving conceptual devices with better performance and selectivity will derive from the topological control over cyclic peptide assembly and the functionalization of the lumen.},

abstract = {5-HT(3) receptors are members of the Cys loop family of ligand-gated ion channels. We used the substituted cysteine accessibility method to identify amino acid residues in the channel forming domain, M2 that face the water-accessible surface and to locate their position in the ion conduction pathway. Cysteine was substituted for each residue, one at a time, in the M2 segment (Asp(274)-Asp(298)). 5-Hydroxytryptamine EC(50) values for functional mutants did not vary from wild type (1.4 +/- 0.2 microm) by more than 10-fold, and five mutants were nonfunctional. Covalent modification of the mutant receptors with sulfydryl reagents revealed 11 residues to be water-accessible, with a pattern consistent with an alpha-helix except at Leu(285) and Leu(293). The data suggest that charge selectivity begins at a more cytoplasmic level than Val(291). Modification at some positions (Val(291), Leu(293), Ile(294), Leu(287), and Ser(280)) resulted in channels that were locked open. Reaction rates with accessible cysteines were voltage-dependent at some residues, suggesting that access occurs via the ion channel. Overall the data observed are similar but not identical to that reported for other members of the family and confirms the high degree of structural and functional homology between receptors in the Cys loop receptor family.},

abstract = {The SLC13 transporter family, whose members play key physiological roles in the regulation of fatty acid synthesis, adiposity, insulin resistance, and other processes, catalyzes the transport of Krebs cycle intermediates and sulfate across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. SLC13 transporters are part of the divalent anion:Na(+) symporter (DASS) family that includes several well-characterized bacterial members. Despite sharing significant sequence similarity, the functional characteristics of DASS family members differ with regard to their substrate and coupling ion dependence. The publication of a high resolution structure of dimer VcINDY, a bacterial DASS family member, provides crucial structural insight into this transporter family. However, marrying this structural insight to the current functional understanding of this family also demands a comprehensive analysis of the transporter's functional properties. To this end, we purified VcINDY, reconstituted it into liposomes, and determined its basic functional characteristics. Our data demonstrate that VcINDY is a high affinity, Na(+)-dependent transporter with a preference for C4- and C5-dicarboxylates. Transport of the model substrate, succinate, is highly pH dependent, consistent with VcINDY strongly preferring the substrate's dianionic form. VcINDY transport is electrogenic with succinate coupled to the transport of three or more Na(+) ions. In contrast to succinate, citrate, bound in the VcINDY crystal structure (in an inward-facing conformation), seems to interact only weakly with the transporter in vitro. These transport properties together provide a functional framework for future experimental and computational examinations of the VcINDY transport mechanism.},

abstract = {The dynamics of confined water in capillaries and nanotubes suggests that gating of ion channels may involve not only changes of the pore geometry, but also transitions between water-filled and empty states in certain locations. The recently solved heptameric structure of the small mechanosensitive channel of Escherichia coli, MscS, has revealed a relatively wide (7-15 A) yet highly hydrophobic transmembrane pore. Continuum estimations based on the properties of pore surface suggest low conductance and a thermodynamic possibility of dewetting. To test the predictions we performed molecular dynamics simulations of MscS filled with flexible TIP3P water. Irrespective to the initial conditions, several independent 6-ns simulations converged to the same stable state with the pore water-filled in the wider part, but predominantly empty in the narrow hydrophobic part, displaying intermittent vapor-liquid transitions. The polar gain-of-function substitution L109S in the constriction resulted in a stable hydration of the entire pore. Steered passages of Cl(-) ions through the narrow part of the pore consistently produced partial ion dehydration and required a force of 200-400 pN to overcome an estimated barrier of 10-20 kcal/mole, implying negligibly low conductance. We conclude that the crystal structure of MscS does not represent an open state. We infer that MscS gate, which is similar to that of the nicotinic ACh receptor, involves a vapor-lock mechanism where limited changes of geometry or surface polarity can locally switch the regime between water-filled (conducting) and empty (nonconducting) states.},

abstract = {Ion channels catalyze the permeation of charged molecules across cell membranes and are essential for many vital physiological functions, including nerve and muscle activity. To understand better the mechanisms underlying ion conduction and valence selectivity of narrow ion channels, we have employed free energy techniques to calculate the potential of mean force (PMF) for ion movement through the prototypical gramicidin A channel. Employing modern all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) force fields with umbrella sampling methods that incorporate one hundred 1-2 ns trajectories, we find that it is possible to achieve semi-quantitative agreement with experimental binding and conductance measurements. We also examine the sensitivity of the MD-PMF results to the choice of MD force field and compare PMFs for potassium, calcium and chloride ions to explore the basis for the valence selectivity of this narrow and uncharged ion channel. A large central barrier is observed for both anions and divalent ions, consistent with lack of experimental conductance. Neither anion or divalent cation is seen to be stabilized inside the channel relative to the bulk electrolyte and each leads to large disruptions to the protein and membrane structure when held deep inside the channel. Weak binding of calcium ions outside the channel corresponds to a free energy well that is too shallow to demonstrate channel blocking. Our findings emphasize the success of the MD-PMF approach and the sensitivity of ion energetics to the choice of biomolecular force field.},

abstract = {Normal mode analysis (NMA) is a powerful tool for predicting the possible movements of a given macromolecule. It has been shown recently that half of the known protein movements can be modelled by using at most two low-frequency normal modes. Applications of NMA cover wide areas of structural biology, such as the study of protein conformational changes upon ligand binding, membrane channel opening and closure, potential movements of the ribosome, and viral capsid maturation. Another, newly emerging field of NMA is related to protein structure determination by X-ray crystallography, where normal mode perturbed models are used as templates for diffraction data phasing through molecular replacement (MR). Here we present ElN\'{e}mo, a web interface to the Elastic Network Model that provides a fast and simple tool to compute, visualize and analyse low-frequency normal modes of large macro-molecules and to generate a large number of different starting models for use in MR. Due to the ‘rotation-translation-block’ (RTB) approximation implemented in ElN\'{e}mo, there is virtually no upper limit to the size of the proteins that can be treated. Upon input of a protein structure in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format, ElN\'{e}mo computes its 100 lowest-frequency modes and produces a comprehensive set of descriptive parameters and visualizations, such as the degree of collectivity of movement, residue mean square displacements, distance fluctuation maps, and the correlation between observed and normal-mode-derived atomic displacement parameters (B-factors). Any number of normal mode perturbed models for MR can be generated for download. If two conformations of the same (or a homologous) protein are available, ElN\'{e}mo identifies the normal modes that contribute most to the corresponding protein movement.

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels are targets of general anesthetics. Although the search for discrete anesthetic binding sites has achieved some degree of success, little is known regarding how anesthetics work after the events of binding. Using the crystal structures of the bacterial Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), which is sensitive to a variety of general anesthetics, we performed multiple molecular dynamics simulations in the presence and absence of the general anesthetic isoflurane. Isoflurane bound to several locations within GLIC, including the transmembrane pocket identified crystallographically, the extracellular (EC) domain, and the interface of the EC and transmembrane domains. Isoflurane also entered the channel after the pore was dehydrated in one of the simulations. Isoflurane disrupted the quaternary structure of GLIC, as evidenced in a striking association between the binding and breakage of intersubunit salt bridges in the EC domain. The pore-lining helix experienced lateral and inward radial tilting motion that contributed to the channel closure. Isoflurane binding introduced strong anticorrelated motions between different subunits of GLIC. The demonstrated structural and dynamical modulations by isoflurane aid in the understanding of the underlying mechanism of anesthetic inhibition of GLIC and possibly other homologous pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. ?? 2011 Biophysical Society.},

Methylated cytosine can also be distinguished from the four standard DNA bases: guanine, adenine, thymine and cytosine. The operating conditions are compatible with the exonuclease, and the kinetic data show that the nucleotides have a high probability of translocation through the nanopore and, therefore, of not being registered twice.

For these membranes the elastic area expansivity modulus increases from approximately 200 to 600 dyn/cm, and the tension at lysis increases from 5.7 to 13.2 dyn/cm, i.e., the membranes become more cohesive with increasing cholesterol content. The critical membrane voltage, Vc, required for breakdown was also found to increase with increasing cholesterol from 1.1 to 1.8 V at zero membrane tension. We have modeled the behavior in terms of the bilayer expansivity. Membrane area can be increased by either tensile or electrocompressive stresses. Both can store elastic energy in the membrane and eventually cause breakdown at a critical area dilation or critical energy. The model predicts a relation between tension and voltage at breakdown and this relation is verified experimentally for the three reconstituted membrane systems studied here.},

abstract = {In this study we concentrate on replacing side chains as a subtask of model building by homology. Two problems arise. How to determine potential low energy rotamers? And how to avoid the combinatorial explosion that results from the combination of many residues for which multiple good rotamers are predicted? We attempt to solve these problems by choosing position-specific rather than generalized rotamers and by sorting the residues that have to be modelled as a function of their freedom in rotamer space. The practical advantages of our method are the quality of the models for cases of high backbone similarity, the small amount of human intervention needed, and the fact that the method automatically estimates the reliability with which each residue has been modeled. Other methods described in this issue are probably more suitable if large backbone rearrangements or loop insertions and deletions need to be modeled.},

@article{Pourmousa2014,
abstract = {Although dehydroergosterol (DHE) is one of the most commonly used cholesterol (CHOL) reporters, it has remained unclear why it performs well compared with most other CHOL analogues and what its possible limitations are. We present a comprehensive study of the properties of DHE using a combination of time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, quantum-mechanical electronic structure computations, and classical atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We first establish that DHE mimics CHOL behavior, as previous studies have suggested, and then move on to elucidate and discuss the particular properties that render DHE so superior. We found that the main reason why DHE mimics CHOL so well is due to its ability to stand upright in a membrane in a manner that is almost identical to that of CHOL. The minor difference in how DHE and CHOL tilt with respect to membrane normal has only faint effects on structural membrane properties, and even the lateral pressure profiles of model membranes with CHOL or DHE are almost identical. These results suggest that the mechanical/elastic effects of DHE on the function of mechanically sensitive membrane proteins are not substantially different from those of CHOL. Our study highlights similar dynamical behavior of CHOL and DHE, which implies that DHE can mimic CHOL in processes with free energies close to the thermal energy.},

Typhi, reproduces many of the acute symptoms of typhoid fever in an animal model. We identify specific carbohydrate moieties on specific surface glycoproteins that serve as receptors for typhoid toxin, which explains its broad cell target specificity. We present the atomic structure of typhoid toxin, which shows an unprecedented A2B5 organization with two covalently linked A subunits non-covalently associated to a pentameric B subunit. The structure provides insight into the toxin's receptor-binding specificity and delivery mechanisms and reveals how the activities of two powerful toxins have been co-opted into a single, unique toxin that can induce many of the symptoms characteristic of typhoid fever. These findings may lead to the development of potentially life-saving therapeutics against typhoid fever.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels are an important family of membrane proteins and play key roles in physiological processes, including signal transduction at chemical synapses. Here, we study the conformational changes associated with the opening and closing of the channel pore. Based on recent crystal structures of two prokaryotic members of the family in open and closed states, respectively, mixed elastic network models are constructed for the transmembrane domain. To explore the conformational changes in the gating transition, a coarse-grained transition path is computed that smoothly connects the closed and open conformations of the channel. We find that the conformational transition involves no major rotations of the transmembrane helices, and is instead characterized by a concerted tilting of helices M2 and M3. In addition, helix M2 changes its bending state, which results in an early closure of the pore during the open-to-closed transition. ?? 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria serves as a protective barrier against the external environment but is rendered selectively permeable to nutrients and waste by proteins called porins. Other outer membrane proteins (OMPs) provide the membrane with a variety of other functions including active transport, catalysis, pathogenesis and signal transduction. A relatively small number of crystal or NMR structures of these proteins are known, and it is therefore essential that the maximum possible information be extracted. In this respect, computational techniques enable extrapolation from time- and space-averaged static structures to dynamic, physiological events. Electrostatics approaches have been used to investigate the structures of porins. The stochastic simulation of ion trajectories through these channels has been possible with Brownian dynamics, which treats the membrane and solvent approximately, enabling the prediction of conduction properties. Molecular dynamics has also been applied, enabling fully atomistic descriptions of 'virtual outer membranes'. This has provided atomic resolution descriptions of solute permeation through porins. It has also yielded insights into the dynamics of gating in active transporters and ion channels, as well as providing clues to catalytic mechanisms in outer membrane enzymes. Additionally, simulations are beginning to reveal the common features of interactions between membrane proteins and lipids, with biological implications for OMP folding, stability and mechanism. Future prospects include the simulation of longer, larger and more complex outer membrane systems, with more accurate descriptions of inter-atomic forces.},

abstract = {Strongly inwardly rectifying potassium channels exhibit potent and steeply voltage-dependent block by intracellular polyamines. To locate the polyamine binding site, we have examined the effects of polyamine blockade on the rate of MTSEA modification of cysteine residues strategically substituted in the pore of a strongly rectifying Kir channel (Kir6.2[N160D]). Spermine only protected cysteines substituted at a deep location in the pore, between the "rectification controller" residue (N160D in Kir6.2, D172 in Kir2.1) and the selectivity filter, against MTSEA modification. In contrast, blockade with a longer synthetic polyamine (CGC-11179) also protected cysteines substituted at sites closer to the cytoplasmic entrance of the channel. Modification of a cysteine at the entrance to the inner cavity (169C) was unaffected by either spermine or CGC-11179, and spermine was clearly "locked" into the inner cavity (i.e., exhibited a dramatically slower exit rate) following modification of this residue. These data provide physical constraints on the spermine binding site, demonstrating that spermine stably binds at a deep site beyond the "rectification controller" residue, near the extracellular entrance to the channel.},

abstract = {The transport of water in nanoconfined geometries is different from bulk phase and has tremendous implications in nanotechnology and biotechnology. Here molecular dynamics is used to compute the self-diffusion coefficient D of water within nanopores, around nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes and proteins. For almost 60 different cases, D is found to scale linearly with the sole parameter $\theta$ as D($\theta$) = D(B)[1+(D(C)/D(B)-1)$\theta$], with DB and DC the bulk and totally confined diffusion of water, respectively. The parameter $\theta$ is primarily influenced by geometry and represents the ratio between the confined and total water volumes. The D($\theta$) relationship is interpreted within the thermodynamics of supercooled water. As an example, such relationship is shown to accurately predict the relaxometric response of contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging. The D($\theta$) relationship can help in interpreting the transport of water molecules under nanoconfined conditions and tailoring nanostructures with precise modulation of water mobility.},

The components of ion channels are asymmetrically distributed between membrane surfaces, which are significant for the implementation of the complex biological function. Inspired by this natural asymmetrical design, here we develop a biomimetic asymmetric responsive single nanochannel system that displays the advanced feature of providing control over pH- and temperature-tunable asymmetric ionic transport properties through asymmetric modifications inside the single nanochannels, which could be considered as a primal platform for the simulation of different ionic transport processes as well as the enhancement of the functionality of ion channels.},

These membrane proteins are present in all kingdoms of life with a high degree of sequence conservation. To gain insight into the determinants of ion selectivity, we have determined the crystal structure of Staphylococcus capitis DMT (ScaDMT), a close prokaryotic homolog of the family. ScaDMT shows a familiar architecture that was previously identified in the amino acid permease LeuT. The protein adopts an inward-facing conformation with a substrate-binding site located in the center of the transporter. This site is composed of conserved residues, which coordinate Mn(2+), Fe(2+) and Cd(2+) but not Ca(2+). Mutations of interacting residues affect ion binding and transport in both ScaDMT and human DMT1. Our study thus reveals a conserved mechanism for transition-metal ion selectivity within the SLC11 family.},

abstract = {The capacity of numerous bacterial species to tolerate antibiotics and other toxic compounds arises in part from the activity of energy-dependent transporters. In Gram-negative bacteria, many of these transporters form multicomponent 'pumps' that span both inner and outer membranes and are driven energetically by a primary or secondary transporter component. A model system for such a pump is the acridine resistance complex of Escherichia coli. This pump assembly comprises the outer-membrane channel TolC, the secondary transporter AcrB located in the inner membrane, and the periplasmic AcrA, which bridges these two integral membrane proteins. The AcrAB-TolC efflux pump is able to transport vectorially a diverse array of compounds with little chemical similarity, thus conferring resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics. Homologous complexes are found in many Gram-negative species, including in animal and plant pathogens. Crystal structures are available for the individual components of the pump and have provided insights into substrate recognition, energy coupling and the transduction of conformational changes associated with the transport process. However, how the subunits are organized in the pump, their stoichiometry and the details of their interactions are not known. Here we present the pseudo-atomic structure of a complete multidrug efflux pump in complex with a modulatory protein partner from E. coli. The model defines the quaternary organization of the pump, identifies key domain interactions, and suggests a cooperative process for channel assembly and opening. These findings illuminate the basis for drug resistance in numerous pathogenic bacterial species.},

abstract = {Opening of ion channels directly by tension in the surrounding membrane appears to be the most ancient and simple mechanism of gating. Bacterial mechanosensitive channels MscL and MscS are the best-studied tension-gated nanopores, yet the key physical factors that define their gating are still hotly debated. Here we present estimations, simulations and experimental results showing that hydration of the pore might be one of the major parameters defining the thermodynamics and kinetics of mechanosensitive channel gating. We associate closing of channel pores with complete dehydration of the hydrophobic gate (occlusion by 'vapor lock') and formation of two water-vapor interfaces above and below the constriction. The opening path is the expansion of these interfaces, ultimately leading to wetting of the hydrophobic pore, which does not appear to be the exact reverse of the closing path, thus producing hysteresis. We discuss specifically the role of polar groups (glycines) buried in narrow closed conformations but exposed in the open states that change the wetting characteristics of the pore lining and stabilize conductive states of the channels.},

abstract = {DNA molecules tethered inside a protein pore can be used as a tool to probe distance and electrical potential. The approach and its limitations were tested with alpha-hemolysin, a pore of known structure. A single oligonucleotide was attached to an engineered cysteine to allow the binding of complementary DNA strands inside the wide internal cavity of the extramembranous domain of the pore. The reversible binding of individual oligonucleotides produced transient current blockades in single channel current recordings. To probe the internal structure of the pore, oligonucleotides with 5' overhangs of deoxyadenosines and deoxythymidines up to nine bases in length were used. The characteristics of the blockades produced by the oligonucleotides indicated that single-stranded overhangs of increasing length first approach and then thread into the transmembrane beta-barrel. The distance from the point at which the DNA was attached and the internal entrance to the barrel is 43 A, consistent with the lengths of the DNA probes and the signals produced by them. In addition, the tethered DNAs were used to probe the electrical potential within the protein pore. Binding events of oligonucleotides with an overhang of five bases or more, which threaded into the beta-barrel, exhibited shorter residence times at higher applied potentials. This finding is consistent with the idea that the main potential drop is across the alpha-hemolysin transmembrane beta-barrel, rather than the entire length of the lumen of the pore. It therefore explains why the kinetics and thermodynamics of formation of short duplexes within the extramembranous cavity of the pore are similar to those measured in solution, and bolsters the idea that a "DNA nanopore" provides a useful means for examining duplex formation at the single molecule level.},

abstract = {High unitary Cl(-) conductance in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl(-) channel requires a functionally unique, positively charged lysine residue (K95) in the inner vestibule of the channel pore. Here we used a mutagenic approach to investigate the ability of other sites in the pore to host this important positive charge. The loss of conductance observed in the K95Q mutation was >50% rescued by substituting a lysine for each of five different pore-lining amino acids, suggesting that the exact location of the fixed positive charge is not crucial to support high conductance. Moving the positive charge also restored open-channel blocker interactions that are lost in K95Q. Introducing a second positive charge in addition to that at K95 did not increase conductance at any site, but did result in a striking increase in the strength of block by divalent Pt(NO(2))(4)(2-) ions. Based on the site dependence of these effects, we propose that although the exact location of the positive charge is not crucial for normal pore properties, transplanting this charge to other sites results in a diminution of its effectiveness that appears to depend on its location along the axis of the pore.},

abstract = {Sensitivity and specificity are two most important factors to take into account for molecule sensing, chemical detection and disease diagnosis. A perfect sensitivity is to reach the level where a single molecule can be detected. An ideal specificity is to reach the level where the substance can be detected in the presence of many contaminants. The rapidly progressing nanopore technology is approaching this threshold. A wide assortment of biomotors and cellular pores in living organisms perform diverse biological functions. The elegant design of these transportation machineries has inspired the development of single molecule detection based on modulations of the individual current blockage events. The dynamic growth of nanotechnology and nanobiotechnology has stimulated rapid advances in the study of nanopore based instrumentation over the last decade, and inspired great interest in sensing of single molecules including ions, nucleotides, enantiomers, drugs, and polymers such as PEG, RNA, DNA, and polypeptides. This sensing technology has been extended to medical diagnostics and third generation high throughput DNA sequencing. This review covers current nanopore detection platforms including both biological pores and solid state counterparts. Several biological nanopores have been studied over the years, but this review will focus on the three best characterized systems including ??-hemolysin and MspA, both containing a smaller channel for the detection of single stranded DNA, as well as bacteriophage phi29 DNA packaging motor connector that contains a larger channel for the passing of double stranded DNA. The advantage and disadvantage of each system are compared; their current and potential applications in nanomedicine, biotechnology, and nanotechnology are discussed. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Cellular membranes separate distinct aqueous compartments, but can be breached by transient hydrophilic pores. A large energetic cost prevents pore formation, which is largely dependent on the composition and structure of the lipid bilayer. The softness of bilayers and the disordered structure of pores make their characterization difficult. We use molecular-dynamics simulations with atomistic detail to study the thermodynamics, kinetics, and mechanism of pore formation and closure in DLPC, DMPC, and DPPC bilayers, with pore formation free energies of 17, 45, and 78 kJ/mol, respectively. By using atomistic computer simulations, we are able to determine not only the free energy for pore formation, but also the enthalpy and entropy, which yields what is believed to be significant new insights in the molecular driving forces behind membrane defects. The free energy cost for pore formation is due to a large unfavorable entropic contribution and a favorable change in enthalpy. Changes in hydrogen bonding patterns occur, with increased lipid-water interactions, and fewer water-water hydrogen bonds, but the total number of overall hydrogen bonds is constant. Equilibrium pore formation is directly observed in the thin DLPC lipid bilayer. Multiple long timescale simulations of pore closure are used to predict pore lifetimes. Our results are important for biological applications, including the activity of antimicrobial peptides and a better understanding of membrane protein folding, and improve our understanding of the fundamental physicochemical nature of membranes.},

abstract = {We perform molecular dynamics simulations of narrow single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in aqueous urea to investigate the structure and dynamical behavior of urea molecules inside the SWNT. Even at low urea concentrations (e.g., 0.5 M), we have observed spontaneous and continuous filling of SWNT with a one-dimensional urea wire (leaving very few water molecules inside the SWNT). The urea wire is structurally ordered, both translationally and orientationally, with a contiguous hydrogen-bonded network and concerted urea's dipole orientations. Interestingly, despite the symmetric nature of the whole system, the potential energy profile of urea along the SWNT is asymmetric, arising from the ordering of asymmetric urea partial charge distribution (or dipole moment) in confined environment. Furthermore, we study the kinetics of confined urea and find that the permeation of urea molecules through the SWNT decreases significantly (by a factor of ∼20) compared to that of water molecules, due to the stronger dispersion interaction of urea with SWNT than water, and a maximum in urea permeation happens around a concentration of 5 M. These findings might shed some light on the better understanding of unique properties of molecular wires (particularly the wires formed by polar organic small molecules) confined within both artificial and biological nanochannels, and are expected to have practical applications such as the electronic devices for signal transduction and multiplication at the nanoscale.},

abstract = {Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is essential for most Gram-negative bacteria and has crucial roles in protection of the bacteria from harsh environments and toxic compounds, including antibiotics. Seven LPS transport proteins (that is, LptA-LptG) form a trans-envelope protein complex responsible for the transport of LPS from the inner membrane to the outer membrane, the mechanism for which is poorly understood. Here we report the first crystal structure of the unique integral membrane LPS translocon LptD-LptE complex. LptD forms a novel 26-stranded $\beta$-barrel, which is to our knowledge the largest $\beta$-barrel reported so far. LptE adopts a roll-like structure located inside the barrel of LptD to form an unprecedented two-protein 'barrel and plug' architecture. The structure, molecular dynamics simulations and functional assays suggest that the hydrophilic O-antigen and the core oligosaccharide of the LPS may pass through the barrel and the lipid A of the LPS may be inserted into the outer leaflet of the outer membrane through a lateral opening between strands $\beta$1 and $\beta$26 of LptD. These findings not only help us to understand important aspects of bacterial outer membrane biogenesis, but also have significant potential for the development of novel drugs against multi-drug resistant pathogenic bacteria.},

abstract = {A general approach for the computational design of enzymes to catalyze arbitrary reactions is a goal at the forefront of the field of protein design. Recently, computationally designed enzymes have been produced for three chemical reactions through the synthesis and screening of a large number of variants. Here, we present an iterative approach that has led to the development of the most catalytically efficient computationally designed enzyme for the Kemp elimination to date. Previously established computational techniques were used to generate an initial design, HG-1, which was catalytically inactive. Analysis of HG-1 with molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and X-ray crystallography indicated that the inactivity might be due to bound waters and high flexibility of residues within the active site. This analysis guided changes to our design procedure, moved the design deeper into the interior of the protein, and resulted in an active Kemp eliminase, HG-2. The cocrystal structure of this enzyme with a transition state analog (TSA) revealed that the TSA was bound in the active site, interacted with the intended catalytic base in a catalytically relevant manner, but was flipped relative to the design model. MD analysis of HG-2 led to an additional point mutation, HG-3, that produced a further threefold improvement in activity. This iterative approach to computational enzyme design, including detailed MD and structural analysis of both active and inactive designs, promises a more complete understanding of the underlying principles of enzymatic catalysis and furthers progress toward reliably producing active enzymes.},

abstract = {A highly sensitive and reliable method to sense and identify a single chemical at extremely low concentrations and high contamination is important for environmental surveillance, homeland security, athlete drug monitoring, toxin/drug screening, and earlier disease diagnosis. This article reports a method for precise detection of single chemicals. The hub of the bacteriophage phi29 DNA packaging motor is a connector consisting of 12 protein subunits encircled into a 3.6 nm channel as a path for dsDNA to enter during packaging and to exit during infection. The connector has previously been inserted into a lipid bilayer to serve as a membrane-embedded channel. Herein we report the modification of the phi29 channel to develop a class of sensors to detect single chemicals. The lysine-234 of each protein subunit was mutated to cysteine, generating 12-SH ring lining the channel wall. Chemicals passing through this robust channel and interactions with the SH group generated extremely reliable, precise, and sensitive current signatures as revealed by single channel conductance assays. Ethane (57 Da), thymine (167 Da), and benzene (105 Da) with reactive thioester moieties were clearly discriminated upon interaction with the available set of cysteine residues. The covalent attachment of each analyte induced discrete stepwise blockage in current signature with a corresponding decrease in conductance due to the physical blocking of the channel. Transient binding of the chemicals also produced characteristic fingerprints that were deduced from the unique blockage amplitude and pattern of the signals. This study shows that the phi29 connector can be used to sense chemicals with reactive thioesters or maleimide using single channel conduction assays based on their distinct fingerprints. The results demonstrated that this channel system could be further developed into very sensitive sensing devices.},

abstract = {Both scientists and engineers are interested in the design and fabrication of synthetic nanofluidic architectures that mimic the gating functions of biological ion channels. The effort to build such structures requires interdisciplinary efforts at the intersection of chemistry, materials science, and nanotechnology. Biological ion channels and synthetic nanofluidic devices have some structural and chemical similarities, and therefore, they share some common features in regulating the traverse ionic flow. In the past decade, researchers have identified two asymmetric ion transport phenomena in synthetic nanofluidic structures, the rectified ionic current and the net diffusion current. The rectified ionic current is a diode-like current-voltage response that occurs when switching the voltage bias. This phenomenon indicates a preferential direction of transport in the nanofluidic system. The net diffusion current occurs as a direct product of charge selectivity and is generated from the asymmetric diffusion through charged nanofluidic channels. These new ion transport phenomena and the elaborate structures that occur in biology have inspired us to build functional nanofluidic devices for both fundamental research and practical applications. In this Account, we review our recent progress in the design and fabrication of biomimetic solid-state nanofluidic devices with asymmetric ion transport behavior. We demonstrate the origin of the rectified ionic current and the net diffusion current. We also identify several influential factors and discuss how to build these asymmetric features into nanofluidic systems by controlling (1) nanopore geometry, (2) surface charge distribution, (3) chemical composition, (4) channel wall wettability, (5) environmental pH, (6) electrolyte concentration gradient, and (7) ion mobility. In the case of the first four features, we build these asymmetric features directly into the nanofluidic structures. With the final three, we construct different environmental conditions in the electrolyte solutions on either side of the nanochannel. The novel and well-controlled nanofluidic phenomena have become the foundation for many promising applications, and we have highlighted several representative examples. Inspired by the electrogenic cell of the electric eel, we have demonstrated a proof-of-concept nanofluidic reverse electrodialysis system (NREDS) that converts salinity gradient energy into electricity by means of net diffusion current. We have also constructed chirality analysis systems into nanofluidic architectures and monitored these sensing events as the change in the degree of ionic current rectification. Moreover, we have developed a biohybrid nanosystem, in which we reconstituted the F0F1-ATPase on a liposome-coated, solid-state nanoporous membrane. By applying a transmembrane proton concentration gradient, the biohybrid nanodevice can synthesize ATP in vitro. These findings have improved our understanding of the asymmetric ion transport phenomena in synthetic nanofluidic systems and offer innovative insights into the design of functional nanofluidic devices.},

abstract = {Switchable ion channels that are made of membrane proteins play different roles in cellular circuits. Since gating nanopore channels made of proteins can only work in the environment of lipid membrane, they are not fully compatible to the application requirement as a component of those nanodevice systems in which lipid membranes are hard to establish. Here we report a synthetic nanopore-DNA system where single solid-state conical nanopores can be reversibly gated by switching DNA motors immobilized inside the nanopores. High- (on-state) and low- (off-state) conductance states were found within this nanopore-DNA system corresponding to the single-stranded and i-motif structures of the attached DNA motors. The highest gating efficiency indicated as current ratio of on-state versus off-state was found when the length of the attached DNA molecule matched the tip diameter of the nanopore well. This novel nanopore-DNA system, which was gated by collective folding of structured DNA molecules responding to the external stimulus, provided an artificial counterpart of switchable protein-made nanopore channels. The concept of this DNA motor-driven nanopore switch can be used to build novel, biologically inspired nanopore machines with more precisely controlled functions in the near future by replacing the DNA molecules with other functional biomolecules, such as polypeptides or protein enzymes.},

abstract = {Neurotransmitter binding to Cys-loop receptors promotes a prodigious transmembrane flux of several million ions/s, but to date, structural determinants of ion flux have been identified flanking the membrane-spanning region. Using x-ray crystallography, sequence analysis, and single-channel recording, we identified a novel determinant of ion conductance near the point of entry of permeant ions. Co-crystallization of acetylcholine-binding protein with sulfate anions revealed coordination of SO4(2-) with a ring of lysines at a position equivalent to 24 A above the lipid membrane in homologous Cys-loop receptors. Analysis of multiple sequence alignments revealed that residues equivalent to the ring of lysines are negatively charged in cation-selective receptors but are positively charged in anion-selective receptors. Charge reversal of side chains at homologous positions in the nicotinic receptor from the motor end plate decreases unitary conductance up to 80%. Selectivity filters stemming from transmembrane alpha-helices have similar pore diameters and compositions of amino acids. These findings establish that when the channel opens under a physiological electrochemical gradient, permeant ions are initially stabilized within the extracellular vestibule of Cys-loop receptors, and this stabilization is a major determinant of ion conductance.},

abstract = {G-protein-gated inward rectifier K(+) (GIRK) channels allow neurotransmitters, through G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation, to control cellular electrical excitability. In cardiac and neuronal cells this control regulates heart rate and neural circuit activity, respectively. Here we present the 3.5 \AA resolution crystal structure of the mammalian GIRK2 channel in complex with $\beta$$\gamma$ G-protein subunits, the central signalling complex that links G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation to K(+) channel activity. Short-range atomic and long-range electrostatic interactions stabilize four $\beta$$\gamma$ G-protein subunits at the interfaces between four K(+) channel subunits, inducing a pre-open state of the channel. The pre-open state exhibits a conformation that is intermediate between the closed conformation and the open conformation of the constitutively active mutant. The resultant structural picture is compatible with 'membrane delimited' activation of GIRK channels by G proteins and the characteristic burst kinetics of channel gating. The structures also permit a conceptual understanding of how the signalling lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and intracellular Na(+) ions participate in multi-ligand regulation of GIRK channels.},

However, uncontrolled electrophoresis of DNA through these nanopores is too fast for accurate base reads. Here, we describe forward and reverse ratcheting of DNA templates through the $\alpha$-hemolysin nanopore controlled by phi29 DNA polymerase without the need for active voltage control. DNA strands were ratcheted through the pore at median rates of 2.5-40 nucleotides per second and were examined at one nucleotide spatial precision in real time. Up to 500 molecules were processed at ∼130 molecules per hour through one pore. The probability of a registry error (an insertion or deletion) at individual positions during one pass along the template strand ranged from 10% to 24.5% without optimization. This strategy facilitates multiple reads of individual strands and is transferable to other nanopore devices for implementation of DNA sequence analysis.},

The crystal structure of Orai from Drosophila melanogaster, determined at 3.35 angstrom resolution, reveals that the calcium channel is composed of a hexameric assembly of Orai subunits arranged around a central ion pore. The pore traverses the membrane and extends into the cytosol. A ring of glutamate residues on its extracellular side forms the selectivity filter. A basic region near the intracellular side can bind anions that may stabilize the closed state. The architecture of the channel differs markedly from other ion channels and gives insight into the principles of selective calcium permeation and gating.},

abstract = {The accurate prediction of membrane-insertion probability for arbitrary protein sequences is a critical challenge to identifying membrane proteins and determining their folded structures. Although algorithms based on sequence statistics have had moderate success, a complete understanding of the energetic factors that drive the insertion of membrane proteins is essential to thoroughly meeting this challenge. In the last few years, numerous attempts to define a free-energy scale for amino-acid insertion have been made, yet disagreement between most experimental and theoretical scales persists. However, for a recently resolved water-to-bilayer scale, it is found that molecular dynamics simulations that carefully mimic the conditions of the experiment can reproduce experimental free energies, even when using the same force field as previous computational studies that were cited as evidence of this disagreement. Therefore, it is suggested that experimental and simulation-based scales can both be accurate and that discrepancies stem from disparities in the microscopic processes being considered rather than methodological errors. Furthermore, these disparities make the development of a single universally applicable membrane-insertion free energy scale difficult.},

Here functional pentameric assembly of truncated fragments comprising the ligand-binding N-terminal ectodomains and the first three transmembrane helices, M1-M3, of both the inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha1 and the 5HT(3)A receptor subunits was found to be rescued by coexpressing the complementary fourth transmembrane helix, M4. Alanine scanning identified multiple aromatic residues in M1, M3 and M4 as key determinants of GlyR assembly. Homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that these residues define an interhelical aromatic network, which we propose determines the geometry of M1-M4 tetrahelical packing such that nascent pLGIC subunits must adopt a closed fivefold symmetry. Because pLGIC ectodomains form random nonstoichiometric oligomers, proper pentameric assembly apparently depends on intersubunit interactions between extracellular domains and intrasubunit interactions between transmembrane segments.},

abstract = {The pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment of liquid and pumpable products contaminated with microorganisms has attracted significant interest from the pulsed power and bioscience research communities particularly because the inactivation mechanism is non-thermal, thereby allowing retention of the original nutritional and flavour characteristics of the product. Although the biological effects of PEF have been studied for several decades, the physical mechanisms of the interaction of the fields with microorganisms is still not fully understood. The present work is a study of the dynamics of the electrical field both in a PEF treatment chamber with dielectric barriers and in the plasma (cell) membrane of a microbial cell. It is shown that the transient process can be divided into three physical phases, and models for these phases are proposed and briefly discussed. The complete dynamics of the time development of the electric field in a spherical dielectric shell representing the cellular membrane is then obtained using an analytical solution of the Ohmic conduction problem. It was found that the field in the membrane reaches a maximum value that could be two orders of magnitude higher than the original Laplacian electrical field in the chamber, and this value was attained in a time comparable to the field relaxation time in the chamber. Thus, the optimal duration of the field during PEF treatment should be equal to such a time.},

Here we show that, while the AMBER ff03 potential is known to favor helical structures, a simple correction to the backbone potential (ff03*) results in an unbiased energy function. We take as examples the 35-residue ??-helical Villin HP35 and 37 residue ??-sheet Pin WW domains, which had not previously been folded with the same force field. Starting from unfolded configurations, simulations of both proteins in Amber ff03* in explicit solvent fold to within 2.0 ?? RMSD of the experimental structures. This demonstrates that a simple backbone correction results in a more transferable force field, an important requirement if simulations are to be used to interpret folding mechanism. ?? 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Accurate free-energy calculations provide mechanistic insights into molecular recognition and conformational equilibrium. In this work, we performed free-energy calculations to study the thermodynamic properties of different states of molecular systems in their equilibrium basin, and obtained accurate absolute binding free-energy calculations for protein-ligand binding using a newly developed M2 algorithm. We used a range of Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG)-in/out p38?? mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors as our test cases. We also focused on the flexible DFG motif, which is closely connected to kinase activation and inhibitor binding. Our calculations explain the coexistence of DFG-in and DFG-out states of the loop and reveal different components (e.g., configurational entropy and enthalpy) that stabilize the apo p38?? conformations. To study novel ligand-binding modes and the key driving forces behind them, we computed the absolute binding free energies of 30 p38?? inhibitors, including analogs with unavailable experimental structures. The calculations revealed multiple stable, complex conformations and changes in p38?? and inhibitor conformations, as well as balance in several energetic terms and configurational entropy loss. The results provide relevant physics that can aid in designing inhibitors and understanding protein conformational equilibrium. Our approach is fast for use with proteins that contain flexible regions for structure-based drug design. ?? 2012 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were modified with 8-hydroxyquinoline and used for the removal of Cu(II), Pb(II), Cd(II) and Zn(II) from aqueous solutions. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed the successful modification of the MWCNTs with 8-hydroxyquinoline. The adsorption parameters, such as the amount of MWCNTs used, temperature, pH, ionic strength, metal ion concentration, and competition among metal ions, were studied and optimized. The results showed that most of the metals were removed from aqueous solution using 250mg of MWCNTs at pH 7.0 and 298K in 0.01M KNO 3 after 10min of adsorption. The results also showed that the competition between the target heavy metals was in the order of Cu(II)>Pb(II)≈Zn(II)>Cd(II) for % adsorption. The recycling, desorption and regeneration of the MWCNTs were evaluated and the results demonstrated that most of the metal ions desorbed at pH values lower than 2.0, and the MWCNTs could be used for up to three cycles of adsorption/desorption without losing efficiency. The pristine and modified MWCNTs were used to remove the target heavy metals from two real samples collected from the Red Sea and a wastewater treatment plant. Both pristine and modified MWCNTs were capable of removing the heavy metals from the real samples. In general, the modification of MWCNTs with 8-hydroxyquinoline significantly enhanced the removal of heavy metals from aqueous solution. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

Here, we introduce an oligomer family that efficiently self-assembles by means of reversible covalent anchoring of nucleobase recognition units onto simple oligo-dipeptide backbones [thioester peptide nucleic acids (tPNAs)] and undergoes dynamic sequence modification in response to changing templates in solution. The oligomers specifically self-pair with complementary tPNA strands and cross-pair with RNA and DNA in Watson-Crick fashion. Thus, tPNA combines base-pairing interactions with the side-chain functionalities of typical peptides and proteins.

Organization in soft materials emerges from the competition between physical and chemical interactions acting on different length scales; the geometry of the system modulates this competition and, hence, dictates its structure and function. Theoretical studies of molecular organization in planar and curved geometries require the treatment of the coupling between interactions, chemical equilibrium and geometrical constraints. We analyse here how curvature affects the morphology of polymers on nano-curved surfaces and determines the apparent equilibrium constants of surface-confined chemical reactions, such as acid–base chemistry. We also review the practical implications of introducing soft materials into nanofluidic devices. In particular, we present and discuss recent theoretical studies and simulations of the transport of ions, solvent and large cargoes through polyelectrolyte-brush-modified pores. We believe that this basic understanding will guide experimental efforts towards the design of stimuli-responsive nanopore gates.},

@article{Akitake2007,
abstract = {2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol (TFE), a low-dielectric solvent, has recently been used as a promising tool to probe the strength of intersubunit interactions in membrane proteins. An analysis of inner membrane proteins of Escherichia coli has identified several SDS-resistant protein complexes that separate into subunits upon exposure to TFE. One of these was the homo-heptameric stretch-activated mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS), a ubiquitous component of the bacterial turgor-regulation system. Here we show that a substantial fraction of MscS retains its oligomeric state in cold lithium-dodecyl-sulfate gel electrophoresis. Exposure of MscS complexes to 10-15 vol % TFE in native membranes or nonionic detergent micelles before lithium-dodecyl-sulfate electrophoresis results in a complete dissociation into monomers, suggesting that at these concentrations TFE by itself disrupts or critically compromises intersubunit interactions. Patch-clamp analysis of giant E. coli spheroplasts expressing MscS shows that exposure to TFE in lower concentrations (0.5-5.0 vol %) causes leftward shifts of the dose-response curves when applied extracellularly, and rightward shifts when added from the cytoplasmic side. In the latter case, TFE increases the rate of tension-dependent inactivation and lengthens the process of recovery to the resting state. MscS responses to pressure ramps of different speeds indicate that in the presence of TFE most channels reside in the resting state and only at tensions near the activation threshold does TFE dramatically speed up inactivation. The effect of TFE is reversible as normal channel activity returns 15-30 min after a TFE washout. We interpret the observed midpoint shifts in terms of asymmetric partitioning of TFE into the membrane and distortion of the bilayer lateral pressure profile. We also relate the increased rate of inactivation and subunit separation with the capacity of TFE to perturb buried interhelical contacts in proteins and discuss these effects in the framework of the proposed gating mechanism of MscS.},

abstract = {Formation of a water bridge across the lipid bilayer is the first stage of pore formation in molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of electroporation, suggesting that the intrusion of individual water molecules into the membrane interior is the initiation event in a sequence that leads to the formation of a conductive membrane pore. To delineate more clearly the role of water in membrane permeabilization, we conducted extensive MD simulations of water bridge formation, stabilization, and collapse in palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers and in water-vacuum-water systems, in which two groups of water molecules are separated by a 2.8 nm vacuum gap, a simple analog of a phospholipid bilayer. Certain features, such as the exponential decrease in water bridge initiation time with increased external electric field, are similar in both systems. Other features, such as the relationship between water bridge lifetime and the diameter of the water bridge, are quite different between the two systems. Data such as these contribute to a better and more quantitative understanding of the relative roles of water and lipid in membrane electropore creation and annihilation, facilitating a mechanism-driven development of electroporation protocols. These methods can be extended to more complex, heterogeneous systems that include membrane proteins and intracellular and extracellular membrane attachments, leading to more accurate models of living cells in electric fields.},

abstract = {The Erwinia ligand-gated ion channel (ELIC) is a bacterial homologue of vertebrate Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels. It is activated by GABA, and this property, combined with its structural similarity to GABAA and other Cys-loop receptors, makes it potentially an excellent model to probe their structure and function. Here we characterise the pharmacological profile of ELIC, examining the effects of compounds that could activate or inhibit the receptor. We confirm that a range of amino acids and classic GABAA receptor agonists do not elicit responses in ELIC, and we show the receptor can be at least partially activated by 5-aminovaleric acid and $\gamma$- hydroxybutyric acid, which are weak agonists. A range of GABAA receptor non-competitive antagonists inhibit GABA-elicited ELIC responses including $\alpha$-endosulfan (IC50 = 17 $\mu$M), dieldrin (IC 50 = 66 $\mu$M), and picrotoxinin (IC50 = 96 $\mu$M) which were the most potent. Docking suggested possible interactions at the 2′ and 6′ pore-lining residues, and mutagenesis of these residues supports this hypothesis for $\alpha$-endosulfan. A selection of compounds that act at Cys-loop and other receptors also showed some efficacy at blocking ELIC responses, but most were of low potency (IC50 > 100 $\mu$M). Overall our data show that a number of compounds can inhibit ELIC, but it has limited pharmacological similarity to GLIC and to Cys-loop receptors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Some CLC proteins are ion channels while others are pumps that exchange Cl(-) for H(+). The pathway through which Cl(-) ions cross the membrane has been characterized, but the transport of H(+) and the principle by which their movement is coupled to Cl(-) movement is not well understood. Here we show that H(+) transport depends not only on the presence of a specific glutamate residue but also the presence of Cl(-) ions. H(+) transport, however, can be isolated and analyzed in the absence of Cl(-) by mutating the glutamate to alanine and adding carboxylate-containing molecules to solution, consistent with the notion that H(+) transfer is mediated through the entry of a carboxylate group into the anion pathway. Cl(-) ions and carboxylate interact with each other strongly. These data support a mechanism in which the glutamate carboxylate functions as a surrogate Cl(-) ion, but it can accept a H(+) and transfer it between the external solution and the central Cl(-) binding site, coupled to the movement of 2 Cl(-) ions.},

abstract = {Lipid bilayers, normally a barrier to charged species and large molecules, are permeabilized by electric fields, a phenomenon exploited by cell biologists and geneticists for porating and transfecting cells and tissues. Recent molecular simulation studies have advanced our understanding of electroporation, but the relative contributions of atomically local details (interface water and headgroup dipole and counterion configurations) and medium- and long-range electrostatic gradients and changes in membrane structural shifts to the initiating conditions and mechanisms of pore formation remain unclear. Molecular dynamics simulations of electroporation in several lipid systems presented here reveal the effects of lipid hydrocarbon tail length and composition on the magnitude of the field required for poration and on the location of the initial sites of field-driven water intrusion into the bilayer. Minimum porating external fields of 260 mV nm(-1), 280 mV nm(-1), 320 mV nm(-1), and 380 mV nm(-1) were found for 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), and 1,2-dioleoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers, respectively, and correlated most strongly with the bilayer thickness. These phospholipid systems share several common features including a wide, dynamic distribution of the headgroup dipole angle with the bilayer normal ranging from 0 to 155 degrees that is only slightly shifted in a porating electric field, and similar electric field-induced shifts in water dipole orientation, although the mean water dipole moment profile at the aqueous-membrane interface is more sensitive to the electric field for DOPC than for the other phospholipids. The location of pore initiation, at the anode- or cathode-facing leaflet, varies with the composition of the bilayer and correlates with a change in the polarity of the localized electric field at the interface.},

abstract = {Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein plays an important role in the DNA replication process in a wide range of organisms. It binds to ssDNA to prevent premature reannealing and to protect it from degradation. Current understanding of SSB/ssDNA interaction points to a complex mechanism, including SSB motion along the DNA strand. We report on the first characterization of this interaction at the single-molecule level using solid-state nanopore sensors, namely without any labeling or surface immobilization. Our results show that the presence of SSB on the ssDNA can control the speed of nanopore translocation, presumably due to strong interactions between SSB and the nanopore surface. This enables nanopore-based detection of ssDNA fragments as short as 37 nt, which is normally very difficult with solid-state nanopore sensors, due to constraints in noise and bandwidth. Notably, this fragment is considerably shorter than the 65 nt binding motif, typically required for SSB binding at high salt concentrations. The nonspecificity of SSB binding to ssDNA further suggests that this approach could be used for fragment sizing of short ssDNA.},

abstract = {Synthetic channels, such as nanotubes, offer the possibility of ion-selective nanoscale pores which can broadly mimic the functions of various biological ion channels, and may one day be used as antimicrobial agents, or for treatment of cystic fibrosis. We have designed a carbon nanotube that is selectively permeable to anions. The virtual nanotubes are constructed from a hexagonal array of carbon atoms (graphene) rolled up to form a tubular structure, with an effective radius of 4.53 \AA and length of 34 \AA. The pore ends are terminated with polar carbonyl groups. The nanotube thus formed is embedded in a lipid bilayer and a reservoir containing ionic solutions is added at each end of the pore. The conductance properties of these synthetic channels are then examined with molecular and stochastic dynamics simulations. Profiles of the potential of mean force at 0 mM reveal that a cation moving across the pore encounters an insurmountable free energy barrier of ∼25 kT in height. In contrast, for anions, there are two energy wells of ∼12 kT near each end of the tube, separated by a central free energy barrier of 4 kT. The conductance of the pore, with symmetrical 500 mM solutions in the reservoirs, is 72 pS at 100 mV. The current saturates with an increasing ionic concentration, obeying a Michaelis-Menten relationship. The pore is normally occupied by two ions, and the rate-limiting step in conduction is the time taken for the resident ion near the exit gate to move out of the energy well.},

However, little is known at the atomic level about the heart of the functional mechanism for this tetrameric protein, a His(37)-Trp(41) cluster. We report the structure of the M2 conductance domain (residues 22 to 62) in a lipid bilayer, which displays the defining features of the native protein that have not been attainable from structures solubilized by detergents. We propose that the tetrameric His(37)-Trp(41) cluster guides protons through the channel by forming and breaking hydrogen bonds between adjacent pairs of histidines and through specific interactions of the histidines with the tryptophan gate. This mechanism explains the main observations on M2 proton conductance.},

The fitting technique combines using accurate ab initio data as the target, choosing an efficient fitting subspace of the whole potential-energy surface, and determining weights for each of the fitting points based on magnitudes of the potential-energy gradient. The average energy RMS deviation from the LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-f)//HF/6-31G** data is reduced by ca. 40% from 0.81 to 0.47 kcal/mol as a result of the fitting for the electrostatically uncharged dipeptides. Transferability of the parameters is demonstrated by using the same alanine dipeptide-fitted backbone torsional parameters for all of the other dipeptides (with the appropriate side-chain refitting) and the alanine tetrapeptide. Parameters of nonbonded interactions have also been refitted for the sulfur-containing dipeptides (cysteine and methionine), and the validity of the new Coulombic charges and the van der Waals $\sigma$’s and ’s is proved through reproducing gas-phase energies of complex formation heats of vaporization and densities of pure model liquids. Moreover, a novel approach to fitting torsional parameters for electrostatically charged molecular systems has been presented and successfully tested on five dipeptides with charged side chains.},

abstract = {Recent experimental results revealed that lipid-mediated interactions due to hydrophobic forces may be important in determining the protein topology after insertion in the membrane, in regulating the protein activity, in protein aggregation and in signal transduction. To gain insight into the lipid-mediated interactions between two intrinsic membrane proteins, we developed a mesoscopic model of a lipid bilayer with embedded proteins, which we studied with dissipative particle dynamics. Our calculations of the potential of mean force between transmembrane proteins show that hydrophobic forces drive long-range protein-protein interactions and that the nature of these interactions depends on the length of the protein hydrophobic segment, on the three-dimensional structure of the protein and on the properties of the lipid bilayer. To understand the nature of the computed potentials of mean force, the concept of hydrophilic shielding is introduced. The observed protein interactions are interpreted as resulting from the dynamic reorganization of the system to maintain an optimal hydrophilic shielding of the protein and lipid hydrophobic parts, within the constraint of the flexibility of the components. Our results could lead to a better understanding of several membrane processes in which protein interactions are involved.},

@article{Gu1999,
abstract = {The detection of organic molecules is important in many areas, including medicine, environmental monitoring and defence. Stochastic sensing is an approach that relies on the observation of individual binding events between analyte molecules and a single receptor. Engineered transmembrane protein pores are promising sensor elements for stochastic detection, and in their simplest manifestation they produce a fluctuating binary ('on/off') response in the transmembrane electrical current. The frequency of occurrence of the fluctuations reveals the concentration of the analyte, and its identity can be deduced from the characteristic magnitude and/or duration of the fluctuations. Genetically engineered versions of the bacterial pore-forming protein alpha-haemolysin have been used to identify and quantify divalent metal ions in solution. But it is not immediately obvious how versatile binding sites for organic ligands might be obtained by engineering of the pore structure. Here we show that stochastic sensing of organic molecules can be procured from alpha-haemolysin by equipping the channel with an internal, non-covalently bound molecular 'adapter' which mediates channel blocking by the analyte. We use cyclodextrins as the adapters because these fit comfortably inside the pore and present a hydrophobic cavity suitable for binding a variety of organic analytes. Moreover, a single sensing element of this sort can be used to analyse a mixture of organic molecules with different binding characteristics. We envisage the use of other adapters, so that the pore could be 'programmed' for a range of sensing functions.},

abstract = {Sodium-glucose transporters (SGLTs) facilitate the movement of water across the cell membrane, playing a central role in cellular homeostasis. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the mechanism of water permeation through the inward-facing state of vSGLT based on nearly 10 $\mu$s of molecular dynamics simulations. These simulations reveal the transient formation of a continuous water channel through the transporter that permits water to permeate the protein. Trajectories in which spontaneous release of galactose is observed, as well as those in which galactose remains in the binding site, show that the permeation rate, although modulated by substrate occupancy, is not tightly coupled to substrate release. Using a, to our knowledge, novel channel-detection algorithm, we identify the key residues that control water flow through the transporter and show that solvent gating is regulated by side-chain motions in a small number of residues on the extracellular face. A sequence alignment reveals the presence of two insertion sites in mammalian SGLTs that flank these outer-gate residues. We hypothesize that the absence of these sites in vSGLT may account for the high water permeability values for vSGLT determined via simulation compared to the lower experimental estimates for mammalian SGLT1.},

Recognition inside a nanoporous membrane is particularly attractive, because of the advantages associated with ligand-receptor interactions in confined spaces. Classical nanoporous membrane-based separations simply use the difference in size of the analytes relative to pore size in the membrane. In order to bring about selectivity beyond size, it is necessary that methods for functionalizing the membrane pores are readily available. Here, we describe a simple approach to functionalize the nanopores within these membranes using self-assembling and non-self-assembling polymers. We show that these modified membranes separate small molecules based on size, charge and hydrophobicity. We also demonstrate here that proteins can be differentially transported through the nanopores based on their size and/or electrostatics.},

This study uses a mathematical model to investigate the effects of electroporation and membrane kinetics on Vm in a cardiac fiber. The model consists of the core conductor equation for a one-dimensional fiber, where excitability is represented by the Luo-Rudy dynamic model (1994-1995) and electroporation is described by a membrane conductance that increases exponentially with Vm squared. For shocks delivered during the plateau of an action potential, the model reproduces the experimentally observed saturation of Vm with a root mean square error of 4.27% and a correlation coefficient of 0.9992. For shocks delivered during diastole, the saturation of Vm is qualitatively reproduced even when the sodium and calcium channels are inactivated. Quantitative replication of the response to diastolic shocks is hindered by the choice of electroporation parameters (optimized for shocks delivered during the plateau) and differences in the membrane kinetics between model and experiment. The complex behavior of Vm during large shocks is due to a combination of electroporation, electrotonus, propagation, and active membrane kinetics. The modeling results imply that the experimentally observed saturation of Vm is due to electroporation of the lipid bilayer.},

To locate the polyamine binding site, we have examined the effects of polyamine blockade on the rate of MTSEA modification of cysteine residues strategically substituted in the pore of a strongly rectifying Kir channel (Kir6.2[N160D]). Spermine only protected cysteines substituted at a deep location in the pore, between the "rectification controller" residue (N160D in Kir6.2, D172 in Kir2.1) and the selectivity filter, against MTSEA modification. In contrast, blockade with a longer synthetic polyamine (CGC-11179) also protected cysteines substituted at sites closer to the cytoplasmic entrance of the channel. Modification of a cysteine at the entrance to the inner cavity (169C) was unaffected by either spermine or CGC-11179, and spermine was clearly "locked" into the inner cavity (i.e., exhibited a dramatically slower exit rate) following modification of this residue. These data provide physical constraints on the spermine binding site, demonstrating that spermine stably binds at a deep site beyond the "rectification controller" residue, near the extracellular entrance to the channel.},

abstract = {The epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) has a key role in the regulation of extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure. ENaC belongs to a family of ion channels that sense the external environment. These channels have large extracellular regions that are thought to interact with environmental cues, such as Na(+), Cl(-), protons, proteases, and shear stress, which modulate gating behavior. We sought to determine the molecular mechanism by which ENaC senses high external Na(+) concentrations, resulting in an inhibition of channel activity. Both our structural model of an ENaC $\alpha$ subunit and the resolved structure of an acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC1) have conserved acidic pockets in the periphery of the extracellular region of the channel. We hypothesized that these acidic pockets host inhibitory allosteric Na(+) binding sites. Through site-directed mutagenesis targeting the acidic pocket, we modified the inhibitory response to external Na(+). Mutations at selected sites altered the cation inhibitory preference to favor Li(+) or K(+) rather than Na(+). Channel activity was reduced in response to restraining movement within this region by cross-linking structures across the acidic pocket. Our results suggest that residues within the acidic pocket form an allosteric effector binding site for Na(+). Our study supports the hypothesis that an acidic cleft is a key ligand binding locus for ENaC and perhaps other members of the ENaC/degenerin family.},

abstract = {We observe single nanoparticle translocation events via resistive pulse sensing using silicon nitride pores described by a range of lengths and diameters. Pores are prepared by focused ion beam milling in 50 nm-, 100 nm-, and 500 nm-thick silicon nitride membranes with diameters fabricated to accommodate spherical silica nanoparticles with sizes chosen to mimic that of virus particles. In this manner, we are able to characterize the role of pore geometry in three key components of the detection scheme, namely, event magnitude, event duration, and event frequency. We find that the electric field created by the applied voltage and the pore's geometry is a critical factor. We develop approximations to describe this field, which are verified with computer simulations, and interactions between particles and this field. In so doing, we formulate what we believe to be the first approximation for the magnitude of ionic current blockage that explicitly addresses the invariance of access resistance of solid-state pores during particle translocation. These approximations also provide a suitable foundation for estimating the zeta potential of the particles and/or pore surface when studied in conjunction with event durations. We also verify that translocation achieved by electro-osmostic transport is an effective means of slowing translocation velocities of highly charged particles without compromising particle capture rate as compared to more traditional approaches based on electrophoretic transport.},

abstract = {We explore the conformational dynamics of a homology model of the human alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor using molecular dynamics simulation and analyses of root mean-square fluctuations, block partitioning of segmental motion, and principal component analysis. The results reveal flexible regions and concerted global motions of the subunits encompassing extracellular and transmembrane domains of the subunits. The most relevant motions comprise a bending, hinged at the beta10-M1 region, accompanied by concerted tilting of the M2 helices that widens the intracellular end of the channel. Despite the nanosecond timescale, the observations suggest that tilting of the M2 helices may initiate opening of the pore. The results also reveal direct coupling between a twisting motion of the extracellular domain and dynamic changes of M2. Covariance analysis of interresidue motions shows that this coupling arises through a network of residues within the Cys and M2-M3 loops where Phe135 is stabilized within a hydrophobic pocket formed by Leu270 and Ile271. The resulting concerted motion causes a downward shift of the M2 helices that disrupts a hydrophobic girdle formed by 9' and 13' residues.},

abstract = {A theoretical framework is elaborated to account for the effect of a transmembrane potential in computer simulations. It is shown that a simulation with a constant external electric field applied in the direction normal to the membrane is equivalent to the influence of surrounding infinite baths maintained to a voltage difference via ion-exchanging electrodes connected to an electromotive force. It is also shown that the linearly-weighted displacement charge within the simulation system tracks the net flow of charge through the external circuit comprising the electromotive force and the electrodes. Using a statistical mechanical reduction of the degrees of freedom of the external system, three distinct theoretical routes are formulated and examined for the purpose of characterizing the free energy of a protein embedded in a membrane that is submitted to a voltage difference. The W-route is constructed from the variations in the voltage-dependent potential of mean force along a reaction path connecting two conformations of the protein. The Q-route is based on the average displacement charge as a function of the conformation of the protein. Finally, the G-route considers the relative charging free energy of specific residues, with and without applied membrane potentials. The theoretical formulation is illustrated with a simple model of an ion crossing a vacuum slab surrounded by two aqueous bulk phases and with a fragment of the voltage-sensor of the KvAP potassium channel.},

The barriers to ion conductance and origins of ion selectivity in models of the cationic human 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and the anionic 1 glycine receptor (GlyR), based on the structure of Torpedo nAChR. MD simulations were used to determine water density profiles along the channel length, and they established that both receptor pores were fully hydrated. The very low water density in the middle of the nAChR pore indicated the existence of a hydrophobic constriction. By contrast, the pore of GlyR was lined with hydrophilic residues and remained well-hydrated throughout. Adaptive biasing force simulations allowed us to reconstruct potentials of mean force PMF for Cl– & Na+ in the two receptors. For the nicotinic receptor we observed barriers to ion translocation associated with rings of hydrophobic residues-Val13' and Leu9'-in the middle of the transmembrane domain. This finding further substantiates the hydrophobic gating hypothesis for nAChR. The PMF revealed no significant hydrophobic barrier for chloride translocation in GlyR. For both receptors nonpermeant ions displayed considerable barriers. Thus, the overall electrostatics and the presence of rings of charged residues at the entrance and exit of the channels were sufficient to explain the experimentally observed anion and cation selectivity.},

abstract = {CLC-type exchangers mediate transmembrane Cl(-) transport. Mutations altering their gating properties cause numerous genetic disorders. However, their transport mechanism remains poorly understood. In conventional models, two gates alternatively expose substrates to the intra- or extracellular solutions. A glutamate was identified as the only gate in the CLCs, suggesting that CLCs function by a nonconventional mechanism. Here we show that transport in CLC-ec1, a prokaryotic homolog, is inhibited by cross-links constraining movement of helix O far from the transport pathway. Cross-linked CLC-ec1 adopts a wild-type-like structure, indicating stabilization of a native conformation. Movements of helix O are transduced to the ion pathway via a direct contact between its C terminus and a tyrosine that is a constitutive element of the second gate of CLC transporters. Therefore, the CLC exchangers have two gates that are coupled through conformational rearrangements outside the ion pathway.},

abstract = {Two conserved histidine residues are located near the mid-point of the conduction channel of ammonium transport proteins. The role of these histidines in ammonia and methylamine transport was evaluated by using a combination of in vivo studies, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and potential of mean force (PMF) calculations. Our in vivo results showed that a single change of either of the conserved histidines to alanine leads to the failure to transport methylamine but still facilitates good growth on ammonia, whereas double histidine variants completely lose their ability to transport both methylamine and ammonia. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated the molecular basis of the in vivo observations. They clearly showed that a single histidine variant (H168A or H318A) of AmtB confines the rather hydrophobic methylamine more strongly than ammonia around the mutated sites, resulting in dysfunction in conducting the former but not the latter molecule. PMF calculations further revealed that the single histidine variants form a potential energy well of up to 6 kcal/mol for methylamine, impairing conduction of this substrate. Unlike the single histidine variants, the double histidine variant, H168A/H318A, of AmtB was found to lose its unidirectional property of transporting both ammonia and methylamine. This could be attributed to a greatly increased frequency of opening of the entrance gate formed by F215 and F107, in this variant compared to wild-type, with a resultant lowering of the energy barrier for substrate to return to the periplasm.},

abstract = {Summary E. coli YbgH belongs to the family of proton-dependent oligopeptide transporters (POTs), a subfamily of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of secondary active transporters. Like other MFS transporters, POT proteins switch between two major conformations during substrate transport. Apart from possessing a canonical 12-helix, two-domain transmembrane (TM) core, prokaryotic POT proteins usually have two TM helices inserted between the two domains. Here we determined the crystal structure of YbgH in its inward-facing conformation. Our structure-based functional studies investigated the roles of both the POT signature motif 2 and the inserted interdomain TM helix pair in the stabilization and regulation of the major conformational change in MFS/POT transporters. Furthermore, of all the proton-titratable amino acid residues, Glu21 is the only conserved one (among POTs) located in the central cavity and is critical for in vivo transport. Together, our results support the notion that MFS symporters utilize a transport mechanism based on substrate-protonation coupling. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Because voltage-gated ion channels play critical biological roles, understanding how they can discriminate the native metal ion from rival cations in the milieu is of great interest. Although Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and Na(+) are present in comparable concentrations outside the cell, the factors governing the competition among these cations for the selectivity filter of voltage-gated Ca(2+) ion channel remain unclear. Using density functional theory combined with continuum dielectric methods, we evaluate the effect of (1) the number, chemical type, and charge of the ligands lining the pore, (2) the pore's rigidity, size, symmetry, and solvent accessibility, and (3) the Ca(2+) hydration number outside the selectivity filter on the competition among Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and Na(+) in model selectivity filters. The calculations show how the outcome of this competition depends on the interplay between electronic and solvation effects. Selectivity for monovalent Na(+) over divalent Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) is achieved when solvation effects outweigh electrostatic effects; thus filters comprising a few weak charge-donating groups such as Ser/Thr side chains, where electrostatic effects are relatively weak and are easily overcome by solvation effects, are Na(+)-selective. In contrast, selectivity for divalent Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) over monovalent Na(+) is achieved when metal-ligand electrostatic effects outweigh solvation effects. The key differences in selectivity between Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) lie in the pore size, oligomericity, and solvent accessibility. The results, which are consistent with available experimental data, reveal how the structure and composition of the ion channel selectivity pore had adapted to the specific physicochemical properties of the native metal ion to enhance the competitiveness of the native metal toward rival cations.},

abstract = {The transmembrane (TM) domain of the M2 channel protein from influenza A is a homotetrameric bundle of alpha-helices and provides a model system for computational approaches to self-assembly of membrane proteins. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations have been used to explore partitioning into a membrane of M2 TM helices during bilayer self-assembly from lipids. CG-MD is also used to explore tetramerization of preinserted M2 TM helices. The M2 helix monomer adopts a membrane spanning orientation in a lipid (DPPC) bilayer. Multiple extended CG-MD simulations (5 x 5 micros) were used to study the tetramerization of inserted M2 helices. The resultant tetramers were evaluated in terms of the most populated conformations and the dynamics of their interconversion. This analysis reveals that the M2 tetramer has 2x rotationally symmetrical packing of the helices. The helices form a left-handed bundle, with a helix tilt angle of approximately 16 degrees. The M2 helix bundle generated by CG-MD was converted to an atomistic model. Simulations of this model reveal that the bundle's stability depends on the assumed protonation state of the H37 side chains. These simulations alongside comparison with recent x-ray (3BKD) and NMR (2RLF) structures of the M2 bundle suggest that the model yielded by CG-MD may correspond to a closed state of the channel.},

This finding qualitatively agrees with the observations in the electrospinning experiment that indicated that the application of a voltage to the tip of the syringe needle enhances the evaporation of the water droplet around the tip.

In vivo, perturbations of membrane domains (e.g., by drugs or lipophilic compounds) have major effects on the activity of raft-associated proteins and on signaling pathways, but they are difficult to characterize because of the small size of the domains, typically below optical resolution. Model membranes, instead, can show macroscopic phase separation between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domains, and they are often used to investigate the driving forces of membrane lateral organization. Studies in model membranes have shown that some lipophilic compounds perturb membrane domains, but it is not clear which chemical and physical properties determine domain perturbation. The mechanisms of domain stabilization and destabilization are also unknown. Here we describe the effect of six simple hydrophobic compounds on the lateral organization of phase-separated model membranes consisting of saturated and unsaturated phospholipids and cholesterol. Using molecular simulations, we identify two groups of molecules with distinct behavior: aliphatic compounds promote lipid mixing by distributing at the interface between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domains; aromatic compounds, instead, stabilize phase separation by partitioning into liquid-disordered domains and excluding cholesterol from the disordered domains. We predict that relatively small concentrations of hydrophobic species can have a broad impact on domain stability in model systems, which suggests possible mechanisms of action for hydrophobic compounds in vivo.},

abstract = {MscL is multimeric protein that forms a large conductance mechanosensitive channel in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. Since MscL is gated by tension transmitted through the lipid bilayer, we have been able to measure its gating parameters as a function of absolute tension. Using purified MscL reconstituted in liposomes, we recorded single channel currents and varied the pressure gradient (P) to vary the tension (T). The tension was calculated from P and the radius of curvature was obtained using video microscopy of the patch. The probability of being open (Po) has a steep sigmoidal dependence on T, with a midpoint (T1/2) of 11.8 dyn/cm. The maximal slope sensitivity of Po/Pc was 0.63 dyn/cm per e-fold. Assuming a Boltzmann distribution, the energy difference between the closed and fully open states in the unstressed membrane was DeltaE = 18.6 kBT. If the mechanosensitivity arises from tension acting on a change of in-plane area (DeltaA), the free energy, TDeltaA, would correspond to DeltaA = 6.5 nm2. MscL is not a binary channel, but has four conducting states and a closed state. Most transition rates are independent of tension, but the rate-limiting step to opening is the transition between the closed state and the lowest conductance substate. This transition thus involves the greatest DeltaA. When summed over all transitions, the in-plane area change from closed to fully open was 6 nm2, agreeing with the value obtained in the two-state analysis. Assuming a cylindrical channel, the dimensions of the (fully open) pore were comparable to DeltaA. Thus, the tension dependence of channel gating is primarily one of increasing the external channel area to accommodate the pore of the smallest conducting state. The higher conducting states appear to involve conformational changes internal to the channel that don't involve changes in area.},

abstract = {In free energy calculations based on thermodynamic integration, it is necessary to compute the derivatives of the free energy as a function of one (scalar case) or several (vector case) order parameters. We derive in a compact way a general formulation for evaluating these derivatives as the average of a mean force acting on the order parameters, which involves first derivatives with respect to both Cartesian coordinates and time. This is in contrast with the previously derived formulas, which require first and second derivatives of the order parameter with respect to Cartesian coordinates. As illustrated in a concrete example, the main advantage of this new formulation is the simplicity of its use, especially for complicated order parameters. It is also straightforward to implement in a molecular dynamics code, as can be seen from the pseudocode given at the end. We further discuss how the approach based on time derivatives can be combined with the adaptive biasing force method, an enhanced sampling technique that rapidly yields uniform sampling of the order parameters, and by doing so greatly improves the efficiency of free energy calculations. Using the backbone dihedral angles Phi and Psi in N-acetylalanyl-N'-methylamide as a numerical example, we present a technique to reconstruct the free energy from its derivatives, a calculation that presents some difficulties in the vector case because of the statistical errors affecting the derivatives.},

abstract = {The interactions that drive the folding of beta-barrel membrane proteins have not been well studied because there have been few available model systems for membrane beta-sheets. In this work, we expand on a recently described model system to explore the contributions of interstrand hydrogen bonds, side-chain/side-chain interactions and side-chain/membrane interactions to beta-sheet formation in membranes. These experiments are based on the observation that the hydrophobic hexapeptide acetyl-Trp-Leu-Leu-Leu-Leu-Leu-OH (AcWLLLLL) folds, cooperatively and reversibly, into oligomeric, antiparallel beta-sheets in phosphatidylcholine membranes. To systematically characterize the important interactions that drive beta-sheet formation in membranes, we have used circular dichroism spectroscopy to determine the membrane secondary structure of each member of a complete host-guest family of related peptides of the form AcWLL-X-LL, where X is one of the natural amino acids. Peptides with hydrophobic X-residues of any size or character (X=Ala, Val, Ile, Leu, Cys, Met, Phe and Trp) form similar beta-sheets in membranes, while peptides with any polar X-residue or Gly or Pro at the X-position are random-coils, even when bound to membranes at high concentrations. The observed membrane sheet preferences correlate poorly with intrinsic sheet propensity scales measured in soluble proteins, but they correlate well with several membrane hydrophobicity scales. These results support the idea that the predominant interactions of the side-chains in membrane-bound beta-sheets are with the membrane lipids, and that backbone hydrogen bonding is the major driving force for the stabilization of beta-sheets in membranes.},

abstract = {We describe and validate a new membrane protein topology prediction method, TMHMM, based on a hidden Markov model. We present a detailed analysis of TMHMM's performance, and show that it correctly predicts 97-98 % of the transmembrane helices. Additionally, TMHMM can discriminate between soluble and membrane proteins with both specificity and sensitivity better than 99 %, although the accuracy drops when signal peptides are present. This high degree of accuracy allowed us to predict reliably integral membrane proteins in a large collection of genomes. Based on these predictions, we estimate that 20-30 % of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins, which is in agreement with previous estimates. We further discovered that proteins with N(in)-C(in) topologies are strongly preferred in all examined organisms, except Caenorhabditis elegans, where the large number of 7TM receptors increases the counts for N(out)-C(in) topologies. We discuss the possible relevance of this finding for our understanding of membrane protein assembly mechanisms. A TMHMM prediction service is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/.},

abstract = {Although the activity of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is exquisitely sensitive to its membrane environment, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. The homologous prokaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channel, Gloebacter ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), represents an excellent model for probing the molecular basis of nAChR sensitivity because of its high structural homology, relative ease of expression, and amenability to crystallographic analysis. We show here that membrane-reconstituted GLIC exhibits structural and biophysical properties similar to those of the membrane-reconstituted nAChR, although GLIC is substantially more thermally stable. GLIC, however, does not possess the same exquisite lipid sensitivity. In particular, GLIC does not exhibit the same propensity to adopt an uncoupled conformation where agonist binding is uncoupled from channel gating. Structural comparisons provide insight into the chemical features that may predispose the nAChR to the formation of an uncoupled state.},

@article{Singer1972,
abstract = {A fluid mosaic model is presented for the gross organization and structure of the proteins and lipids of biological membranes. The model is consistent with the restrictions imposed by thermodynamics. In this model, the proteins that are integral to the membrane are a heterogeneous set of globular molecules, each arranged in an amphipathic structure, that is, with the ionic and highly polar groups protruding from the membrane into the aqueous phase, and the nonpolar groups largely buried in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. These globular molecules are partially embedded in a matrix of phospholipid. The bulk of the phospholipid is organized as a discontinuous, fluid bilayer, although a small fraction of the lipid may interact specifically with the membrane proteins. The fluid mosaic structure is therefore formally analogous to a two-dimensional oriented solution of integral proteins (or lipoproteins) in the viscous phospholipid bilayer solvent. Recent experiments with a wide variety of techniqes and several different membrane systems are described, all of which abet consistent with, and add much detail to, the fluid mosaic model. It therefore seems appropriate to suggest possible mechanisms for various membrane functions and membrane-mediated phenomena in the light of the model. As examples, experimentally testable mechanisms are suggested for cell surface changes in malignant transformation, and for cooperative effects exhibited in the interactions of membranes with some specific ligands. Note added in proof: Since this article was written, we have obtained electron microscopic evidence (69) that the concanavalin A binding sites on the membranes of SV40 virus-transformed mouse fibroblasts (3T3 cells) are more clustered than the sites on the membranes of normal cells, as predicted by the hypothesis represented in Fig. 7B. T-here has also appeared a study by Taylor et al. (70) showing the remarkable effects produced on lymphocytes by the addition of antibodies directed to their surface immunoglobulin molecules. The antibodies induce a redistribution and pinocytosis of these surface immunoglobulins, so that within about 30 minutes at 37 degrees C the surface immunoglobulins are completely swept out of the membrane. These effects do not occur, however, if the bivalent antibodies are replaced by their univalent Fab fragments or if the antibody experiments are carried out at 0 degrees C instead of 37 degrees C. These and related results strongly indicate that the bivalent antibodies produce an aggregation of the surface immunoglobulin molecules in the plane of the membrane, which can occur only if the immunoglobulin molecules are free to diffuse in the membrane. This aggregation then appears to trigger off the pinocytosis of the membrane components by some unknown mechanism. Such membrane transformations may be of crucial importance in the induction of an antibody response to an antigen, as well as iv other processes of cell differentiation.},

abstract = {We recently showed that the three "channel" nucleoporins, Nup54, Nup58, and Nup62, interact with each other through only four distinct sites and established the crystal structures of the two resulting "interactomes," Nup54•Nup58 and Nup54•Nup62. We also reported instability of the Nup54•Nup58 interactome and previously determined the atomic structure of the relevant Nup58 segment by itself, demonstrating that it forms a twofold symmetric tetramer. Here, we report the crystal structure of the relevant free Nup54 segment and show that it forms a tetrameric, helical bundle that is structurally "conditioned" for instability by a central patch of polar hydrogen-bonded residues. Integrating these data with our previously reported results, we propose a "ring cycle" for dilating and constricting the nuclear pore. In essence, three homooligomeric rings, one consisting of eight modules of Nup58 tetramers, and two, each consisting of eight modules of Nup54 tetramers, are stacked in midplane and characterize a constricted pore of 10- to 20-nm diameter. In going to the dilated state, segments of one Nup58 and two Nup54 tetrameric modules reassort into a dodecameric module, eight of which form a single, heterooligomeric midplane ring, which is flexible in a diameter range of 40-50 nm. The ring cycle would be regulated by phenylalanine-glycine regions ("FG repeats") of channel nups. Akin to ligand-gated channels, the dilated state of the midplane ring may be stabilized by binding of [cargo•transport-factor] complexes to FG repeats, thereby linking the ratio of constricted to dilated nuclear pores to cellular transport need.},

By applying an electric force larger than the threshold for stretching, dsDNA can be impelled through the pore. Once a current blockade associated with a translocating molecule is detected, the electric field in the pore is switched in an interval less than the translocation time to a value below the threshold for stretching. According to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, this leaves the dsDNA stretched in the pore constriction with the base-pairs tilted, while the B-form canonical structure is preserved outside the pore. In this configuration, the translocation velocity is substantially reduced from 1 bp/10 ns to approximately 1 bp/2 ms in the extreme, potentially facilitating high fidelity reads for sequencing, precise sorting, and high resolution (force) spectroscopy.},

OSG is very brittle and it is susceptible to stress-corrosion cracking in water-containing environments. We have investigated the adhesion degradation of silicon nitride/OSG and silicon carbonitride/OSG interfaces caused by water diffusion. Experimental results are in good quantitative agreement with an analytical model that combines water diffusion with subcritical crack growth. Fracture experiments show that water diffusion in OSG film stacks is remarkably fast and that it has an activation energy of 0.27 eV. The adhesion degradation is completely reversible under mild annealing conditions. Interfacial plasma treatments result in a significant enhancement of the adhesion in the absence of water, but this enhancement is lost almost completely upon exposure of the film stack to water. A diffusion study using deuterium as an isotopic tracer shows that the Si/OSG interface is the main diffusion path. ?? 2007 Acta Materialia Inc.},

Extended (2 x 50 ns) molecular dynamics simulations of the high-resolution structure of the isolated VS domain from the archaebacterial potassium channel KvAP, embedded in zwitterionic and in anionic lipid bilayers, have been used to explore VS/lipid interactions at atomic resolution. The simulations reveal penetration of water into the center of the VS and bilayer. Furthermore, there is significant local deformation of the lipid bilayer by interactions between lipid phosphate groups and arginine side chains of S4. As a consequence of this, the electrostatic field is "focused" across the center of the bilayer.},

abstract = {We investigated the convergence behavior of potential of mean force (PMF) calculations using free energy perturbation (FEP), thermodynamic integration (TI), and “slow growth” (SG) techniques. The critical comparison of these alternative approaches is illustrated by the study of three different systems: two tagged argon atoms in a periodic box of argon, two methane molecules, and two benzene molecules maintained in a “T-shaped” conformation, both dimers embedded in a periodic box of water. The complete PMF simulations were carried out considering several protocols, in which the number of intermediate “$\lambda$” states, together with the amount of sampling per individual state, were varied. In most cases, as much as 1 ns of molecular dynamics (MD) sampling was used to derive each free energy profile. For the different systems examined, we find that FEP and TI unquestionably constitute robust computational methods leading to results of comparable accuracy. We also show that proper convergence of the free energy calculations, and further quantitative interpretation of the PMFs, requires total simulation times much higher than has been hitherto estimated. In some circumstances, the free energy profiles derived from FEP calculations tend to be slightly poorer than those obtained with TI, as a probable consequence of the greater sensitivity of FEP to the window spacing $\delta$$\lambda$. In the context of TI, and to a lesser extent FEP, simulations, it appears preferable to employ a limited number of “$\lambda$” points of the integrand involving extensive sampling, rather than numerous points with fewer samplings. Finally, we note that, at least in the case of nonpolar interactions, PMFs of reasonable quality can be generated using SG, and at a substantially lower cost than with either FEP or TI. © 1996 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

Thermodynamics of field-induced filling of hydrocarbon-like nanopores with water is studied by open ensemble molecular simulation. Increased field strength consistently results in water-filling and electrostriction in hydrophobic nanopores. A threshold field commensurate with surface charge density of about one elementary charge per 10 nm2 suffices to render prototypical paraffin surfaces hydrophilic. When a field is applied in the direction perpendicular to the confining walls, the competition between orientational polarization and angle preferences of interfacial water molecules relative to the walls results in an asymmetric wettability of opposing surfaces (Janus interface). Reduction of surface free energy observed upon alignment of confinement walls with field direction suggests a novel mechanism whereby the applied electric field can operate selectively on water-filled nanotubes while empty ones remain unaffected.},

abstract = {DNA-lipid complexes are of biomedical importance as delivery vectors for gene therapy. To gain insight into the interactions of DNA with zwitterionic and cationic (dimyristoyltrimethylammonium propane (DMTAP)) lipids, we have used coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the self-assembly of DPPC and DPPC/DMTAP lipid bilayers in the presence of a DNA dodecamer. We observed the spontaneous formation of lipid bilayers from initial systems containing randomly placed lipids, water-counterions and DNA. In both the DPPC and DPPC/DMTAP simulations, the DNA molecule is located at the water-lipid headgroup interface, lying approximately parallel to the plane of the bilayer. We have also calculated the potential of mean force for transferring a DNA dodecamer through a DPPC/DMTAP bilayer. A high energetic barrier to DNA insertion into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer is observed. The DNA adopts a transmembrane orientation only in this region. Local bilayer deformation in the vicinity of the DNA molecule is observed, largely as a result of the DNA-DMTAP headgroup attraction.},

abstract = {The behaviour of water and small solutes in confined geometries is important to a variety of chemical and nanofluidic applications. Here we investigate the permeation and distribution of water and ions in electrically charged carbon cylindrical nanopore during the osmotic process using molecular dynamics simulations. In the simulations, charges are distributed uniformly on the pores with diameter of 0.9 nm. For nanopores with no charge or a low charge, ions are difficult to enter. With the increasing of charge densities on the pores, ions will appear inside the nanopores because of the large electronic forces between the ions and the charged pores. Different ion entries induce varying effects on osmotic water flow. Our simulations reveal that the osmotic water can flow through the negatively charged pore occupied by K+ ions, while water flux through the positively charged pores will be disrupted by Cl- ions inside the pores. This may be explained by the different radial distributions of K+ ions and Cl- ions inside the charged nanopores.},

We have combined X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, molecular dynamics and computational modeling to determine the structures of aerolysin mutants in their monomeric and heptameric forms, trapped at various stages of the pore formation process. A dynamic modeling approach based on swarm intelligence was applied, whereby the intrinsic flexibility of aerolysin extracted from new X-ray structures was used to fully exploit the cryo-EM spatial restraints. Using this integrated strategy, we obtained a radically new arrangement of the prepore conformation and a near-atomistic structure of the aerolysin pore, which is fully consistent with all of the biochemical data available so far. Upon transition from the prepore to pore, the aerolysin heptamer shows a unique concerted swirling movement, accompanied by a vertical collapse of the complex, ultimately leading to the insertion of a transmembrane $\beta$-barrel.},

Overviews are given first of the results of studies in defined model systems. These studies address effects of mismatch on protein activity, stability, orientation, aggregational state, localization, and conformation. With respect to the lipids, effects of mismatch are discussed on lipid chain order, phase transition temperature, lipid phase behavior, and microdomain formation. From these studies, it is concluded that hydrophobic mismatch can strongly affect protein and lipid organization, but that the precise consequences depend on the individual properties of the proteins and lipids. Examples of these properties include the propensity of lipids to form non-lamellar structures, the amino acid composition of the hydrophobic transmembrane segments of the proteins, the nature of the membrane anchoring residues, and the number of transmembrane helices. Finally, the effects of mismatch in biological membranes are discussed and its possible consequences for functional membrane processes, such as protein sorting, protein insertion, and regulation of bilayer thickness.},

abstract = {The molecular mechanism(s) of action of anesthetic, and especially, intoxicating doses of alcohol (ethanol [EtOH]) have been of interest even before the advent of the Research Society on Alcoholism. Recent physiological, genetic, and biochemical studies have pin-pointed molecular targets for anesthetics and EtOH in the brain as ligand-gated ion channel (LGIC) membrane proteins, especially the pentameric (5 subunit) Cys-loop superfamily of neurotransmitter receptors including nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChRs), GABAA (GABAA Rs), and glycine receptors (GlyRs). The ability to demonstrate molecular and structural elements of these proteins critical for the behavioral effects of these drugs on animals and humans provides convincing evidence for their role in the drugs' actions. Amino acid residues necessary for pharmacologically relevant allosteric modulation of LGIC function by anesthetics and EtOH have been identified in these channel proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed potential allosteric modulatory sites in both the trans-membrane domain (TMD) and extracellular domain (ECD). Potential sites of action and binding have been deduced from homology modeling of other LGICs with structures known from crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy studies. Direct information about ligand binding in the TMD has been obtained by photoaffinity labeling, especially in GABAA Rs. Recent structural information from crystallized procaryotic (ELIC and GLIC) and eukaryotic (GluCl) LGICs allows refinement of the structural models including evaluation of possible sites of EtOH action.},

abstract = {Ion channels contain extended columns of water molecules within their transbilayer pores. The dynamic properties of such intrapore water have been shown to differ from those of water in its bulk state. In previous molecular dynamics simulations of two classes of model pore (parallel bundles of Ala20 alpha-helices and antiparallel barrels of Ala10 beta-strands), a substantially reduced translational and rotational mobility of waters was observed within the pore relative to bulk water. Molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of a transpore electrostatic field (i.e., a voltage drop along the pore axis) have been used to estimate the resultant polarization (due to reorientation) of the intrapore water, and hence to determine the local dielectric behavior within the pore. It is shown that the local dielectric constant of water within a pore is reduced for models formed by parallel alpha-helix bundles, but not by those formed by beta-barrels. This result is discussed in the context of electrostatics calculations of ion permeation through channels, and the effect of the local dielectric of water within a helix bundle pore is illustrated with a simple Poisson-Boltzmann calculation.},

abstract = {An emerging DNA sequencing technique uses protein or solid-state pores to analyze individual strands as they are driven in single-file order past a nanoscale sensor. However, uncontrolled electrophoresis of DNA through these nanopores is too fast for accurate base reads. Here, we describe forward and reverse ratcheting of DNA templates through the $\alpha$-hemolysin nanopore controlled by phi29 DNA polymerase without the need for active voltage control. DNA strands were ratcheted through the pore at median rates of 2.5-40 nucleotides per second and were examined at one nucleotide spatial precision in real time. Up to 500 molecules were processed at ∼130 molecules per hour through one pore. The probability of a registry error (an insertion or deletion) at individual positions during one pass along the template strand ranged from 10% to 24.5% without optimization. This strategy facilitates multiple reads of individual strands and is transferable to other nanopore devices for implementation of DNA sequence analysis.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated sodium (Na(V)) channels initiate electrical signalling in excitable cells and are the molecular targets for drugs and disease mutations, but the structural basis for their voltage-dependent activation, ion selectivity and drug block is unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of a voltage-gated Na(+) channel from Arcobacter butzleri (NavAb) captured in a closed-pore conformation with four activated voltage sensors at 2.7 \AA resolution. The arginine gating charges make multiple hydrophilic interactions within the voltage sensor, including unanticipated hydrogen bonds to the protein backbone. Comparisons to previous open-pore potassium channel structures indicate that the voltage-sensor domains and the S4-S5 linkers dilate the central pore by pivoting together around a hinge at the base of the pore module. The NavAb selectivity filter is short, ∼4.6 \AA wide, and water filled, with four acidic side chains surrounding the narrowest part of the ion conduction pathway. This unique structure presents a high-field-strength anionic coordination site, which confers Na(+) selectivity through partial dehydration via direct interaction with glutamate side chains. Fenestrations in the sides of the pore module are unexpectedly penetrated by fatty acyl chains that extend into the central cavity, and these portals are large enough for the entry of small, hydrophobic pore-blocking drugs. This structure provides the template for understanding electrical signalling in excitable cells and the actions of drugs used for pain, epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia at the atomic level.},

This traditional approach is reexamined taking into account membrane conductance, surface admittance, and space charge effects. We find that whenever the conductivity of the medium outside the cell is low, large corrections are needed. Thus, in most of the cases where cells are manipulated by external fields (pore formation, cell fusion, cell rotation, dielectrophoresis) the field applied to the cell membrane is significantly reduced, sometimes practically abolished. This could have a strong bearing on present theories of pore formation, and of the influence of weak electric fields on membranes.},

abstract = {Chemically modified nanopores show a strong and nontrivial coupling between ion current and the structure of the immobilized species. In this work we study theoretically the conductance and structure in polymer modified nanopores and explicitly address the problem of the coupling between ion transport and molecular organization. Our approach is based on a nonequilibrium molecular theory that couples ion conductivity with the conformational degrees of freedom of the polymer and the electrostatic and nonelectrostatic interactions among polyelectrolyte chains, ions, and solvent. We apply the theory to study a cylindrical nanopore between two reservoirs as a function of pore diameter and length, the length of the polyelectrolyte chains, their grafting density, and whether they are present or not on the outer reservoir walls. In the very low applied potential regime, where the distribution of polyelectrolyte and ions is similar to that in equilibrium, we present a simple analytical model based on the combination of the different resistances in the system that describes the conductance in excellent agreement with the calculations of the full nonequilibrium molecular theory. On the other hand, for a large applied potential bias, the theory predicts a dramatic reorganization of the polyelectrolyte chains and the ions. This reorganization results from the global optimization of the different interactions in the system under nonequilibrium conditions. For nanopores modified with long chains, this reorganization leads to two interesting physical phenomena: (i) control of polyelectrolyte morphology by the direction and magnitude of ion-fluxes and (ii) an unexpected decrease in system resistance with the applied potential bias for long chains due to the coupling between polyelectrolyte segment distribution and ion currents.},

Oriented lipid multilayers were used to obtain high signal-to-noise intensity data. The chain tilt angle and an estimate of the methylene electron density were obtained from wide angle reflections. The chain tilt angle is measured to be 32.3 +/- 0.6 degrees near full hydration, and it does not change as the sample is mildly dehydrated from a repeat spacing of D = 59.9 A to D = 56.5 A. Low angle diffraction peaks were obtained up to the tenth order for 17 samples with variable D and prepared by three different methods with different geometries. In addition to the usual Fourier reconstructions of the electron density profiles, model electron density profiles were fit to all the low angle data simultaneously while constraining the model to include the wide-angle data and the measured lipid volume.

N-Methyl-D-glucamine was finitely permeant. Permeability ratios PNa/PCs and PNMDG/PCs were 0.90 and 0.083, respectively. 4. Permeability towards divalent cations was assessed from measurements of E5-HT in media where Ca2+ and Mg2+ replaced Na+. PCa/PCs and PMg/PCs were calculated to be 1.00 and 0.61, respectively. 5. Single channel chord conductance (gamma) estimated from fluctuation analysis of macroscopic currents increased with membrane hyperpolarization from 243 fS at -40 mV to 742 fS at -100 mV. 6. Reducing [Ca2+]o from 2 to 0.1 mM caused an increase in the whole-cell current evoked by 5-HT. A concomitant reduction in [Mg2+]o produced further potentiation. Fluctuation analysis indicates that a voltage-independent augmentation of gamma contributes to this phenomenon. 7.

VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more "representations," in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs.

Here, we investigate DNA translocations through a novel type of plasmonic nanopore based on a gold bowtie nanoantenna with a solid-state nanopore at the plasmonic hot spot. Plasmonic excitation of the nanopore is found to influence both the sensor signal (nanopore ionic conductance blockade during DNA translocation) and the process that captures DNA into the nanopore, without affecting the duration time of the translocations. Most striking is a strong plasmon-induced enhancement of the rate of DNA translocation events in lithium chloride (LiCl, already 10-fold enhancement at a few mW of laser power). This provides a means to utilize the excellent spatiotemporal resolution of DNA interrogations with nanopores in LiCl buffers, which is known to suffer from low event rates.

We compare numerical solutions of the Poisson, Nernst-Planck (PNP), and Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with their one-dimensional, analytical approximations. We show that by decreasing the length of the nanopore, the ionic current and ionic selectivity become affected by processes outside the nanochannel. The contribution of electroosmosis is noticeable, especially for highly charged nanochannels, but is insignificant, justifying the use of the simple one-dimensional approximation in many cases. Estimates for the critical electric field at which the nanopore selectivity decreases and the ion current starts to saturate are provided.},

abstract = {Magnesium translocation across cell membranes is essential for numerous physiological processes. Three recently reported crystal structures of the CorA magnesium transport system revealed a surprising architecture, with a bundle of giant $\alpha$-helices forming a 60-\AA-long pore that extends beyond the membrane before widening into a funnel-shaped cytosolic domain. The presence of divalent cations in putative intracellular regulation sites suggests that these structures correspond to the closed conformation of CorA. To examine the nature of the conduction pathway, we performed 110-ns molecular-dynamics simulations of two of these structures in a lipid bilayer with and without regulatory ions. The results show that a 15-\AA-long hydrophobic constriction straddling the membrane-cytosol interface constitutes a steric bottleneck whose location coincides with an electrostatic barrier opposing cation translocation. In one of the simulations, structural relaxation after the removal of regulatory ions led to concerted changes in the tilt of the pore helices, resulting in iris-like dilation and spontaneous hydration of the hydrophobic neck. This simple and robust mechanism is consistent with the regulation of pore opening by intracellular magnesium concentration, and explains the unusual architecture of CorA. © 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

This ideal system provides a reference system with which\nto compare the behavior of water and ions in real porous materials\nsuch as zeolites, bucky tubes, and biological channels. We find that\nin channels of radii between 2.5 and 5.5 AA the water molecules form a\ncylindrical solvation shell inside the channel walls with some\nevidence of a second shell in the center of the largest channel. Not\nall protons are involved in hydrogen bonding and a number point toward\nthe walls. We attribute this to the concavity of the surface. When a\nsodium ion is added it tends to lie in the center of the channel where\nit can form the most complete solvation shell. Its diffusion rate\ndecreases in smaller channels until it moves too slowly in a channel\nof 2 AA radius to be detected in our simulations. This decrease is\nonly partly due to an increase in the mean square force on the ion. A\nrange of ions of different sizes were studied in a channel with radius\n3 AA. While the smaller of these ions (F{sup -}, Na{sup +}, and Ca{sup\n++}) lie preferentially in the center of the channel, larger ions\n(Cl{sup -}, I{sup -}, and Cs{sup +}) penetrate some way into the layer\nof water inside the wall and methane and ions with the charges turned\noff move next to the wall. Landau free energy analysis shows that this\nchange is due to the balance between entropy and energy. The behavior\nin smooth channels is quite the opposite of what has been observed in\nexperimental studies and simulations of Gramicidin (pore radius of 2\nAA), where Cs{sup +} lies closer to the center of the channel and\nNa{sup +} lies off the axis. This difference can be attributed to the\nspecific molecular structure of the gramicidin pores (e.g., the\npresence of carbonyl groups). As in bulk solutions, the mobilities of\nthe ions in smooth channels increase to a maximum with ion size and\ndecrease with increasing magnitude of the charge on the ion, while\nuncharged species diffuse much more rapidly and show a monotonic\ndecrease with size. This behavior is related to the characteristics of\nthe fluctuations of the forces on the solute molecules. (53 refs.)},

Progress has primarily been achieved with bacterial proteins, but efforts to solve the structure of eukaryotic membrane proteins are also increasing. Most of the structures currently available have been obtained by exploiting the power of X-ray crystallography. Recent results, however, have demonstrated the accuracy of electron crystallography and the imaging power of the atomic force microscope. These instruments allow membrane proteins to be studied while embedded in the bi-layer, and thus in a functional state. The low signal-to-noise ratio of cryo-electron microscopy is overcome by crystallizing membrane proteins in a two-dimensional protein-lipid membrane, allowing its atomic structure to be determined. In contrast, the high signal-to-noise ratio of atomic force microscopy allows individual protein surfaces to be imaged at sub-nanometer resolution, and their conformational states to be sampled.

Herein, we have examined the barriers to ion conduction and origins of ion selectivity in the GLIC channel by the construction of potential-of-mean-force profiles for sodium and chloride ions inside the transmembrane region. Our calculations reveal that the GLIC channel is open for a sodium ion to transport, but presents a ???11 kcal/mol free energy barrier for a chloride ion. Our collective findings identify three distinct contributions to the observed preference for the permeant ions. First, there is a substantial contribution due to a ring of negatively charged glutamate residues (E-2') at the narrow intracellular end of the channel. The negative electrostatics of this region and the ability of the glutamate side chains to directly bind cations would strongly favor the passage of sodium ions while hindering translocation of chloride ions. Second, our results imply a significant hydrophobic contribution to selectivity linked to differences in the desolvation penalty for the sodium versus chloride ions in the central hydrophobic region of the pore. This hydrophobic contribution is evidenced by the large free energy barriers experienced by Cr in the middle of the pore for both GLIC and the E-2'A mutant. Finally, there is a distinct contribution arising from the overall negative electrostatics of the channel. ?? 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is associated with the abnormal self-assembly of the amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptide into toxic $\beta$-rich aggregates. Experimental studies have shown that hydrophobic nanoparticles retard A$\beta$ fibrillation by slowing down the nucleation process; however, the effects of nanoparticles on A$\beta$ oligomeric structures remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the conformations of A$\beta$(16-22) octamers in the absence and presence of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) by performing extensive all-atom replica exchange molecular-dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Our simulations starting from eight random chains demonstrate that the addition of SWCNT into A$\beta$(16-22) solution prevents $\beta$-sheet formation. Simulation starting from a prefibrillar $\beta$-sheet octamer shows that SWCNT destabilizes the $\beta$-sheet structure. A detailed analysis of the A$\beta$(16-22)/SWCNT/water interactions reveals that both the inhibition of $\beta$-sheet formation and the destabilization of prefibrillar $\beta$-sheets by SWCNT result from the same physical forces: hydrophobic and $\pi$-stacking interactions (with the latter playing a more important role). By analyzing the stacking patterns between the Phe aromatic rings and the SWCNT carbon rings, we find that short ring-centroid distances mostly favor parallel orientation, whereas large distances allow all other orientations to be populated. Overall, our computational study provides evidence that SWCNT is likely to inhibit A$\beta$(16-22) and full-length A$\beta$ fibrillation.},

abstract = {In Klebsiella pneumoniae the transmembrane $\beta$-barrel forming outer membrane protein KpOmpA mediates adhesion to a wide range of immune effector cells, thereby promoting respiratory tract and urinary infections. As major transmembrane protein OmpA stabilizes Gram-negative bacteria by anchoring their outer membrane to the peptidoglycan layer. Adhesion, osmotic pressure, hydrodynamic flow, and structural deformation apply mechanical stress to the bacterium. This stress can generate tensile load to the peptidoglycan-binding domain (PGBD) of KpOmpA. To investigate how KpOmpA reacts to mechanical stress, we applied a tensile load to the PGBD and observed a detailed unfolding pathway of the transmembrane $\beta$-barrel. Each step of the unfolding pathway extended the polypeptide connecting the bacterial outer membrane to the peptidoglycan layer and absorbed mechanical energy. After relieving the tensile load, KpOmpA reversibly refolded back into the membrane. These results suggest that bacteria may reversibly unfold transmembrane proteins in response to mechanical stress. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Single-channel recording of the translocation duration and current flow during traversal of individual polynucleotides yielded a unique pattern of events for each of the several polymers tested. Statistical data derived from this pattern of events demonstrate that in several cases a nanopore can distinguish between polynucleotides of similar length and composition that differ only in sequence. Studies of temperature effects on the translocation process show that translocation duration scales as approximately T(-2). A strong correlation exists between the temperature dependence of the event characteristics and the tendency of some polymers to form secondary structure. Because nanopores can rapidly discriminate and characterize unlabeled DNA molecules at low copy number, refinements of the experimental approach demonstrated here could eventually provide a low-cost high-throughput method of analyzing DNA polynucleotides.},

Understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying electroporation is therefore important, and provides the motivation of this review of the essential features of theoretical models of electroporation. We particularly emphasize the ability of these models to describe experimental results. Here we discuss the theoretical models that have been proposed, their underlying assumptions, and their successes and failures. Most of our emphasis is on transient aqueous pore models, which can account for: (1) key features of mechanical instability (irreversible consequence of electroporation) in planar lipid bilayers at elevated voltages, (2) dramatic reversible electrical behavior of certain planar membranes and of cell membranes, and (3) some features of molecular transport. In contrast, theories which do not explicitly treat pores appear unable to account for key electroporation phenomena, and are only briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Interactions of lipids are central to the folding and stability of membrane proteins. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations have been used to reveal the mechanisms of self-assembly of protein/membrane and protein/detergent complexes for representatives of two classes of membrane protein, namely, glycophorin (a simple alpha-helical bundle) and OmpA (a beta-barrel). The accuracy of the coarse-grained simulations is established via comparison with the equivalent atomistic simulations of self-assembly of protein/detergent micelles. The simulation of OmpA/bilayer self-assembly reveals how a folded outer membrane protein can be inserted in a bilayer. The glycophorin/bilayer simulation supports the two-state model of membrane folding, in which transmembrane helix insertion precedes dimer self-assembly within a bilayer. The simulations also suggest that a dynamic equilibrium exists between the glycophorin helix monomer and dimer within a bilayer. The simulated glycophorin helix dimer is remarkably close in structure to that revealed by NMR. Thus, coarse-grained methods may help to define mechanisms of membrane protein (re)folding and will prove suitable for simulation of larger scale dynamic rearrangements of biological membranes.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide a valuable approach to the dynamics, structure, and stability of membrane-protein systems. Coarse-grained (CG) models, in which small groups of atoms are treated as single particles, enable extended (>100 ns) timescales to be addressed. In this study, we explore how CG-MD methods that have been developed for detergents and lipids may be extended to membrane proteins. In particular, CG-MD simulations of a number of membrane peptides and proteins are used to characterize their interactions with lipid bilayers. CG-MD is used to simulate the insertion of synthetic model membrane peptides (WALPs and LS3) into a lipid (PC) bilayer. WALP peptides insert in a transmembrane orientation, whilst the LS3 peptide adopts an interfacial location, both in agreement with experimental biophysical data. This approach is extended to a transmembrane fragment of the Vpu protein from HIV-1, and to the coat protein from fd phage. Again, simulated protein/membrane interactions are in good agreement with solid state NMR data for these proteins. CG-MD has also been applied to an M3-M4 fragment from the CFTR protein. Simulations of CFTR M3-M4 in a detergent micelle reveal formation of an alpha-helical hairpin, consistent with a variety of biophysical data. In an I231D mutant, the M3-M4 hairpin is additionally stabilized via an inter-helix Q207/D231 interaction. Finally, CG-MD simulations are extended to a more complex membrane protein, the bacterial sugar transporter LacY. Comparison of a 200 ns CG-MD simulation of LacY in a DPPC bilayer with a 50 ns atomistic simulation of the same protein in a DMPC bilayer shows that the two methods yield comparable predictions of lipid-protein interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate the utility of CG-MD simulations for studies of membrane/protein interactions.},

Membranes of Jurkat cells were stained with a fast voltage-sensitive dye, ANNINE-6, which has a subnanosecond voltage response time. A temporal resolution of 5 ns was achieved by the excitation of this dye with a tunable laser pulse. The laser pulse was synchronized with the applied electric field to record images at times before, during, and after exposure. When exposing the Jurkat cells to a pulse, the voltage across the membrane at the anodic pole of the cell reached values of 1.6 V after 15 ns, almost twice the voltage level generally required for electroporation. Voltages across the membrane on the side facing the cathode reached values of only 0.6 V in the same time period, indicating a strong asymmetry in conduction mechanisms in the membranes of the two opposite cell hemispheres. This small voltage drop of 0.6-1.6 V across the plasma membrane demonstrates that nearly the entire imposed electric field of 10 V/mum penetrates into the interior of the cell and every organelle.},

abstract = {Membrane electroporation is the method to directly transfer bioactive substances such as drugs and genes into living cells, as well as preceding electrofusion. Although much information on the microscopic mechanism has been obtained both from experiment and simulation, the existence and nature of possible intermediates is still unclear. To elucidate intermediates of electropore formation by direct comparison with measured prepore formation kinetics, we have carried out 49 atomistic electroporation simulations on a palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine bilayer for electric field strengths between 0.04 and 0.7 V/nm. A statistical theory is developed to facilitate direct comparison of experimental (macroscopic) prepore formation kinetics with the (single event) preporation times derived from the simulations, which also allows us to extract an effective number of lipids involved in each pore formation event. A linear dependency of the activation energy for prepore formation on the applied field is seen, with quantitative agreement between experiment and simulation. The distribution of preporation times suggests a four-state pore formation model. The model involves a first intermediate characterized by a differential tilt of the polar lipid headgroups on both leaflets, and a second intermediate (prepore), where a polar chain across the bilayer is formed by 3-4 lipid headgroups and several water molecules, thereby providing a microscopic explanation for the polarizable volume derived previously from the measured kinetics. An average pore radius of 0.47 +/- 0.15 nm is seen, in favorable agreement with conductance measurements and electrooptical experiments of lipid vesicles.},

Simulations were carried out with the previously parametrized coarse-grained (CG) SWNT and PEG force fields that had captured the experimentally observed conformations of self-assembled SWNT-lipid complexes and phase behavior of PEG-grafted lipids. Simulations of multiple copies of the SWNT in water show that all pure SWNTs aggregate, lipid-wrapped SWNTs partially aggregate, but those wrapped with lipids grafted to PEG (M(w) = 550) completely disperse, indicating the effect of short PEG chains on interparticle aggregation, in agreement with experiment. Starting with initial SWNT orientation parallel to the bilayer surface, SWNTs wrapped with lysophospholipids and PEG (M(w) = 550)-grafted lipids insert into the hydrophobic region of the bilayer, while SWNTs wrapped with phospholipids and longer PEG (M(w) = 2000)-grafted lipids do not. These indicate that SWNTs insert because of the hydrophobic interaction with the bilayer tails, but the tight wrapping of charged lipid headgroups and long hydrophilic PEG chains can weaken the hydrophobic interaction and inhibit SWNT insertion. The inserted SWNTs contact the entire tails of neighboring lipids in one leaflet of the bilayer, which disorders the lipid bilayer and induces positive curvature. Our findings indicate that interparticle aggregation, SWNT penetration, and membrane curvature can be modulated by the SWNT-lipid structure and the PEG length.},

abstract = {A nanopore is the ultimate analytical tool. It can be used to detect DNA, RNA, oligonucleotides, and proteins with submolecular sensitivity. This extreme sensitivity is derived from the electric signal associated with the occlusion that develops during the translocation of the analyte across a membrane through a pore immersed in electrolyte. A larger occluded volume results in an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio, and so the pore geometry should be made comparable to the size of the target molecule. However, the pore geometry also affects the electric field, the charge density, the electro-osmotic flow, the capture volume, and the response time. Seeking an optimal pore geometry, we tracked the molecular motion in three dimensions with high resolution, visualizing with confocal microscopy the fluorescence associated with DNA translocating through nanopores with diameters comparable to the double helix, while simultaneously measuring the pore current. Measurements reveal single molecules translocating across the membrane through the pore commensurate with the observation of a current blockade. To explain the motion of the molecule near the pore, finite-element simulations were employed that account for diffusion, electrophoresis, and the electro-osmotic flow. According to this analysis, detection using a nanopore comparable in diameter to the double helix represents a compromise between sensitivity, capture volume, the minimum detectable concentration, and response time.},

Here, we use this approach to study the substitution reactions of arsenic(III) compounds with thiols, stretching the limits of the protein pore technology to track the interconversion of seven reaction components in a network that comprises interconnected Walden cycles. Single-molecule pathway analysis of 'allowed' and 'forbidden' reactions reveals that sulfur-sulfur substitution occurs with stereochemical inversion at the arsenic centre.

abstract = {5-HT3A receptors select among permeant ions based on size and charge. The membrane-associated (MA) helix lines the portals into the channel's cytoplasmic vestibule in the 4-\AA resolution structure of the homologous acetylcholine receptor. 5-HT3A MA helix residues are important determinants of single-channel conductance. It is unknown whether the portals into the cytoplasmic vestibule also determine the size selectivity of permeant ions. We sought to determine whether the portals form the size selectivity filter. Recently, we showed that channels functioned when the entire 5-HT3A M3-M4 loop was replaced by the heptapeptide M3-M4 loop sequence from GLIC, a bacterial Cys-loop neurotransmitter gated ion channel homologue from Gloebacter violaceus. We used homomeric 5-HT3A receptors with either a wild-type (WT) M3-M4 loop or the chimeric heptapeptide (5-HT3A-glvM3M4) loop, i.e., with or without portals. In Na(+)-containing buffer, the WT receptor current-voltage relationship was inwardly rectifying. In contrast, the 5-HT3A-glvM3M4 construct had a negative slope conductance region at voltages less than -80 mV. Glutamine substitution for the heptapeptide M3-M4 loop arginine eliminated the negative slope conductance region. We measured the relative permeabilities and conductances of a series of inorganic and organic cations ranging from 0.9 to 4.5 \AA in radius (Li(+), Na(+), ammonium, methylammonium, ethanolammonium, 2-methylethanolammonium, dimethylammonium, diethanolammonium, tetramethylammonium, choline, tris [hydroxymethyl] aminomethane, and N-methyl-d-glucamine). Both constructs had measurable conductances with Li(+), ammonium, and methylammonium (size range of 0.9-1.8-\AA radius). Many of the organic cations >2.4 \AA acted as competitive antagonists complicating measurement of conductance ratios. Analysis of the permeability ratios by excluded volume theory indicates that the minimal pore radius for 5-HT3A and 5-HT3-glvM3M4 receptors was similar, ∼ 5 \AA. We infer that the 5-HT3A size selectivity filter is located in the transmembrane channel and not in the portals into the cytoplasmic vestibule. Thus, the determinants of size selectivity and conductance are located in physically distinct regions of the channel protein.},

Remarkably, the voltage-free diffusion of the 3'-threaded DNA (in the trans to cis direction) is two times slower than the corresponding 5'-threaded DNA having the same poly(dA) sequence. Moreover, the ion currents flowing through the blocked pore with either a 3'-threaded DNA or 5' DNA differ by approximately 30%. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of our system reveal a microscopic mechanism for the asymmetric behavior. In a confining pore, the ssDNA straightens and its bases tilt toward the 5' end, assuming an asymmetric conformation. As a result, the bases of a 5'-threaded DNA experience larger effective friction and forced reorientation that favors co-passing of ions. Our results imply that the translocation process through a narrow pore is more complicated than previously believed and involves base tilting and stretching of ssDNA molecules inside the confining pore.},

In this study, we investigate the influence of C16-ceramide (C16) on the biophysical properties of DMPC lipid bilayers using solid-state NMR and atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD simulations and NMR measurements were carried out for a pure DMPC bilayer and for a 20% DMPC-C16 mixture. Calculated key structural properties, namely area per lipid, chain order parameters, and mass density profiles, indicate that C16 has an ordering effect on the DMPC bilayer. Furthermore, the simulations predict that specific hydrogen-bonds form between DMPC and C16 molecules. Multi-nuclear solid-state NMR was used to verify these theoretical predictions. Chain order parameters extracted from 13C1H dipole couplings were measured for both lipid and ceramide and follow the trend suggested by the MD simulations. Furthermore, 1H-MAS NMR experiments showed a direct contact between ceramide and lipids. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The vast majority of proteins trafficking across or into the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane occur via the translocon. The translocon consists of the SecYEG complex that forms an evolutionarily conserved heterotrimeric protein-conducting membrane channel that functions in conjunction with a variety of ancillary proteins. For posttranslational protein translocation, the translocon interacts with the cytosolic motor protein SecA that drives the ATP-dependent stepwise translocation of unfolded polypeptides across the membrane. For the cotranslational integration of membrane proteins, the translocon interacts with ribosome-nascent chain complexes and membrane insertion is coupled to polypeptide chain elongation at the ribosome. These processes are assisted by the YidC and SecDF(yajC) complex that transiently interacts with the translocon. This review summarizes our current understanding of the structure-function relationship of the translocon and its interactions with ancillary components during protein translocation and membrane protein insertion.

Molecular dynamics simulations offer a powerful way of studying permeation at the single molecule level, yielding detailed dynamic and thermodynamic data. Biological membranes have a very inhomogeneous character and a highly anisotropic behavior. Starting from a computer model proven to reproduce the physical properties of such a complex system, the permeation of small organic molecules across a lipid bilayer model has been studied. Free energy profiles and diffusion coefficients along the bilayer normal have been calculated for small organic molecules by means of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations constraining the compounds at chosen depths inside the membrane. These data also allow for the calculation of permeability coefficients, the results for which have been compared with experimental data. The calculated permeability coefficients are generally 1 order of magnitude larger than the equivalent experimental data, but the molecules' relative permeability coefficients are reproduced.},

abstract = {By making dynamic changes to the area of a droplet interface bilayer (DIB), we are able to measure the specific capacitance of lipid bilayers with improved accuracy and precision over existing methods. The dependence of membrane specific capacitance on the chain-length of the alkane oil present in the bilayer is similar to that observed in black lipid membranes. In contrast to conventional artificial bilayers, DIBs are not confined by an aperture, which enables us to determine that the dependence of whole bilayer capacitance on applied potential is predominantly a result of a spontaneous increase in bilayer area. This area change arises from the creation of new bilayer at the three phase interface and is driven by changes in surface tension with applied potential that can be described by the Young-Lippmann equation. By accounting for this area change, we are able to determine the proportion of the capacitance dependence that arises from a change in specific capacitance with applied potential. This method provides a new tool with which to investigate the vertical compression of the bilayer and understand the changes in bilayer thickness with applied potential. We find that, for 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine membranes in hexadecane, specific bilayer capacitance varies by 0.6-1.5% over an applied potential of ±100 mV.},

abstract = {We use molecular dynamics simulations to study osmotically driven transport of water molecules through hexagonally packed carbon nanotube membranes. Our simulation setup comprises two such semipermeable membranes separating compartments of pure water and salt solution. The osmotic force drives water flow from the pure-water to the salt-solution compartment. Monitoring the flow at molecular resolution reveals several distinct features of nanoscale flows. In particular, thermal fluctuations become significant at the nanoscopic length scales, and as a result, the flow is stochastic in nature. Further, the flow appears frictionless and is limited primarily by the barriers at the entry and exit of the nanotube pore. The observed flow rates are high (5.8 water molecules per nanosecond and nanotube), comparable to those through the transmembrane protein aquaporin-1, and are practically independent of the length of the nanotube, in contrast to predictions of macroscopic hydrodynamics. All of these distinct characteristics of nanoscopic water flow can be modeled quantitatively by a 1D continuous-time random walk. At long times, the pure-water compartment is drained, and the net flow of water is interrupted by the formation of structured solvation layers of water sandwiched between two nanotube membranes. Structural and thermodynamic aspects of confined water monolayers are studied.},

abstract = {Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) transports cholesteryl esters, triglycerides, and phospholipids between different lipoprotein fractions in blood plasma. The inhibition of CETP has been shown to be a sound strategy to prevent and treat the development of coronary heart disease. We employed molecular dynamics simulations to unravel the mechanisms associated with the CETP-mediated lipid exchange. To this end we used both atomistic and coarse-grained models whose results were consistent with each other. We found CETP to bind to the surface of high density lipoprotein (HDL) -like lipid droplets through its charged and tryptophan residues. Upon binding, CETP rapidly (in about 10 ns) induced the formation of a small hydrophobic patch to the phospholipid surface of the droplet, opening a route from the core of the lipid droplet to the binding pocket of CETP. This was followed by a conformational change of helix X of CETP to an open state, in which we found the accessibility of cholesteryl esters to the C-terminal tunnel opening of CETP to increase. Furthermore, in the absence of helix X, cholesteryl esters rapidly diffused into CETP through the C-terminal opening. The results provide compelling evidence that helix X acts as a lid which conducts lipid exchange by alternating the open and closed states. The findings have potential for the design of novel molecular agents to inhibit the activity of CETP.},

abstract = {Water diffusion through OmpF, a porin in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli, is studied by molecular dynamics simulation. A first passage time approach allows characterizing the diffusive properties of a well-defined region of this channel. A carbon nanotube, which is considerably more homogeneous, serves as a model to validate the methodology. Here we find, in addition to the expected regular behavior, a gradient of the diffusion coefficient at the channel ends, witness of the transition from confinement in the channel to bulk behavior in the connected reservoirs. Moreover, we observe the effect of a kinetic boundary layer, which is the counterpart of the initial ballistic regime in a mean square displacement analysis. The overall diffusive behavior of water in OmpF shows remarkable similarity with that in a homogeneous channel. However, a small fraction of the water molecules appears to be trapped by the protein wall for considerable lengths of time. The distribution of trapping times exhibits a broad power law distribution psi(tau) approximately tau (-2.4), up to tau=10 ns, a bound set by the length of the simulation run. We discuss the effect of this distribution on the dynamic properties of water in OmpF in terms of incomplete sampling of phase space.},

abstract = {An extension of the recently developed PRIMO coarse-grained force field to membrane environments, PRIMO-M, is described. The membrane environment is modeled with the heterogeneous dielectric generalized Born (HDGB) methodology that simply replaces the standard generalized Born model in PRIMO without further parametrization. The resulting model was validated by comparing amino acid insertion free energy profiles and application in molecular dynamics simulations of membrane proteins and membrane-interacting peptides. Membrane proteins with 148-661 amino acids show stable root-mean-squared-deviations (RMSD) between 2 and 4 \AA for most systems. Transmembrane helical peptides maintain helical shape and exhibit tilt angles in good agreement with experimental or other simulation data. The association of two glycophorin A (GpA) helices was simulated using replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations yielding the correct dimer structure with a crossing angle in agreement with previous studies. Finally, conformational sampling of the influenza fusion peptide also generates structures in agreement with previous studies. Overall, these findings suggest that PRIMO-M can be used to study membrane bound peptides and proteins and validates the transferable nature of the PRIMO coarse-grained force field.},

abstract = {$\beta$-barrel membrane proteins are essential for nutrient import, signalling, motility and survival. In Gram-negative bacteria, the $\beta$-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex is responsible for the biogenesis of $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins, with homologous complexes found in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Here we describe the structure of BamA, the central and essential component of the BAM complex, from two species of bacteria: Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus ducreyi. BamA consists of a large periplasmic domain attached to a 16-strand transmembrane $\beta$-barrel domain. Three structural features shed light on the mechanism by which BamA catalyses $\beta$-barrel assembly. First, the interior cavity is accessible in one BamA structure and conformationally closed in the other. Second, an exterior rim of the $\beta$-barrel has a distinctly narrowed hydrophobic surface, locally destabilizing the outer membrane. And third, the $\beta$-barrel can undergo lateral opening, suggesting a route from the interior cavity in BamA into the outer membrane.},

abstract = {A study of the voltage induction of transient pores in phospholipid bilayer vesicles is reported. Unilamellar vesicles (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine), with a size distribution of 100 +/- 30 nm, were prepared by the method of Enoch & Strittmatter [Enoch, H., & Strittmatter, P. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 76, 145]. The vesicles loaded with [14C]sucrose and suspended in a mixture of 150 mM NaCl and 272 mM sucrose (both are the isotonic solvent for erythrocytes) were exposed to an intense electric field in the range of 20--40 kV/cm, with a field decay time of 5--15 micro second. A transient leakage of sucrose label was detected when the field strength exceeded 30 kV/cm. After the field was removed, no slow leakage of the tracer molecules occurred during a 65-h incubation period at the room temperature (23 +/- 2 degrees C). The leakage is attributed to the field-induced transmembrane potential, but not other effects such as the Joule heating or the shock wave associated with the voltage discharge. When the potential exceeded a threshold value of 200 mV, corresponding to an applied field strength of 30 kV/cm, there was a dielectric breakdown of the bilayer structure. Pores which allowed passage of sucrose were formed, transiently. Experiments show that these pores were fully reversible, and no global and permanent damages to the vesicle bilayer were detected. The implication of this membrane potential triggered conducting state of lipid bilayers to biological functions of cells is discussed.},

In the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the channel is formed from the related Sec61 complex. Here we report the structure of the Escherichia coli SecYEG assembly at an in-plane resolution of 8 A. The three-dimensional map, calculated from two-dimensional SecYEG crystals, reveals a sandwich of two membranes interacting through the extensive cytoplasmic domains. Each membrane is composed of dimers of SecYEG. The monomeric complex contains 15 transmembrane helices. In the centre of the dimer we observe a 16 x 25 A cavity closed on the periplasmic side by two highly tilted transmembrane helices. This may represent the closed state of the protein-conducting channel.},

In this article, we discuss the effect of cholesterol on lipid-mediated protein-protein interactions as function of hydrophobic mismatch, protein diameter and protein cluster size, lipid tail length, and temperature. To do so, we study a mesoscopic model of a hydrated bilayer containing lipids and cholesterol in which proteins are embedded, with a hybrid dissipative particle dynamics-Monte Carlo method. We propose a mechanism by which cholesterol affects protein interactions: protein-induced, cholesterol-enriched, or cholesterol-depleted lipid shells surrounding the proteins affect the lipid-mediated protein-protein interactions. Our calculations of the potential of mean force between proteins and protein clusters show that the addition of cholesterol dramatically reduces repulsive lipid-mediated interactions between proteins (protein clusters) with positive mismatch, but does not affect attractive interactions between proteins with negative mismatch. Cholesterol has only a modest effect on the repulsive interactions between proteins with different mismatch.},

Due to surface reactions of dissociable functional groups on the nanopore wall, the surface charge density highly depends upon the proton concentration on the nanopore wall, which in turn affects the electrokinetic transport of ions, fluid, and particles within the nanopore. Electrokinetic ion transport in a pH-regulated nanopore, taking into account both multiple ionic species and charge regulation on the nanopore wall, is theoretically investigated for the first time. The model is verified by the experimental data of nanopore conductance available in the literature. The results demonstrate that the spatial distribution of the surface charge density at the nanopore wall and the resulting ion transport phenomena, such as ion concentration polarization (ICP), ion selectivity, and conductance, are significantly affected by the background solution properties, such as the pH and salt concentration.},

abstract = {Interactions between salt ions and lipid components of biological membranes are essential for the structure, stability, and functions of the membranes. The specific ionic composition of aqueous buffers inside and outside of the cell is known to differ considerably. To model such a situation we perform atomistic molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of a single-component phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayer which separates two aqueous reservoirs with and without NaCl salt. To implement the difference in electrolyte composition near two membrane sides, a double bilayer setup (i.e., two bilayers in a simulation box) is employed. It turns out that monovalent salt, being in contact with one leaflet only, induces a pronounced asymmetry in the structural, electrostatic, and dynamical properties of bilayer leaflets after 50 ns of MD simulations. Binding of sodium ions to the carbonyl region of the leaflet which is in contact with salt results in the formation of "Na-lipids" complexes and, correspondingly, reduces mobility of lipids of this leaflet. In turn, attractive interactions of chloride ions (mainly located in the aqueous phase close to the water-lipid interface) with choline lipid groups lead to a substantial (more vertical) reorientation of postphatidylcholine headgroups of the leaflet adjoined to salt. The difference in headgroup orientation on two sides of a bilayer, being coupled with salt-induced reorientation of water dipoles, leads to a notable asymmetry in the charge-density profiles and electrostatic potentials of bilayer constitutes of the two leaflets. Although the overall charge density of the bilayer is found to be almost insensitive to the presence of salt, a slight asymmetry in the charge distribution between the two bilayer leaflets results in a nonzero potential difference of about 85 mV between the two water phases. Thus, a transmembrane potential of the order of the membrane potential in a cell can arise without ionic charge imbalance between two aqueous compartments.},

Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we have studied model membranes comprising ∼7000 lipids and 16 identical copies of model cylindrical proteins of either $\alpha$-helical or $\beta$-barrel types. Through variation of the lipid tail length and hence the degree of hydrophobic mismatch, our simulations display levels of protein aggregation ranging from negligible to extensive. The nature and extent of aggregation are shown to be influenced by membrane curvature and the shape or orientation of the protein. Interestingly, a model $\beta$-barrel protein aggregates to form one-dimensional strings within the bilayer plane, whereas a model $\alpha$-helical bundle forms two-dimensional clusters. Overall, it is clear that the nature and extent of membrane protein aggregation is dependent on several aspects of the proteins and lipids, including hydrophobic mismatch, protein class and shape, and membrane curvature.},

With increasing availability of structural data for well-studied proteins in different forms (liganded, complexed, or free), there is increasing evidence in support of the correspondence between functional changes in structures observed in experiments and the global motions predicted by these coarse-grained analyses. These observed correlations suggest that computational methods may be advantageously employed for assessing functional changes in structure and allosteric mechanisms intrinsically favored by the native fold.},

For this reason, several ion-water clusters, up to five or six water molecules were considered; such structures were optimized, and the Wannier analysis was then applied to determine the average molecular dipole moment of water. We found that with an increasing number of water molecules, the molecular polarization is determined by the water-water interaction rather than the water-ion interaction, as one would intuitively expect. These results are consistent with those obtained in previous density functional calculations and with other results obtained by employing classical polarizable water models. The main message of this work is that as one increases the number of molecules the average dipole moment of all water molecules and the ones in the first shell tends to the same value as the average of a similar sized cluster of pure water. This supports the use of nonpolarizable classical models of water in classical atomistic simulations.},

abstract = {Graphene is an ultrathin, impervious membrane. The controlled introduction of nanoscale pores in graphene would lead to applications that involve water purification, chemical separation, and DNA sequencing. However, graphene nanopores are unstable against filling by carbon adatoms. Here, using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and density-functional calculations, we report that Si atoms stabilize graphene nanopores by bridging the dangling bonds around the perimeter of the hole. Si-passivated pores remain intact even under intense electron beam irradiation, and they were observed several months after the sample fabrication, demonstrating that these structures are intrinsically robust and stable against carbon filling. Theoretical calculations reveal the underlying mechanism for this stabilization effect: Si atoms bond strongly to the graphene edge, and their preference for tetrahedral coordination forces C adatoms to form dendrites sticking out of the graphene plane, instead of filling the nanopore. Our results provide a novel way to develop stable nanopores, which is a major step toward reliable graphene-based molecular translocation devices.},

To stabilize a closed conformation of GLIC, a bacterial proton-gated homolog from Gloeobacter violaceus whose open structure is known, we separately generated either four cross-links or two single mutations. We found all six mutants to be in the same 'locally closed' conformation using X-ray crystallography, sharing most of the features of the open form but showing a locally closed pore as a result of a concerted bending of all of its M2 helices. The mutants adopt several variant conformations of the M2-M3 loop, and in all cases an interacting lipid that is observed in the open form disappears. A single cross-linked mutant is functional, according to electrophysiology, and the locally closed structure of this mutant indicates that it has an increased flexibility. Further cross-linking, accessibility and molecular dynamics data suggest that the locally closed form is a functionally relevant conformation that occurs during allosteric gating transitions.},

abstract = {The behaviour of water in nanopores is very different from that of bulk water. Close to hydrophobic surfaces, the water density has been found to be lower than in the bulk, and if confined in a sufficiently narrow hydrophobic nanopore, water can spontaneously evaporate. Molecular dynamics simulations have suggested that a nanopore can be switched between dry and wet states by applying an electric potential across the nanopore membrane. Nanopores with hydrophobic walls could therefore create a gate system for water, and also for ionic and neutral species. Here, we show that single hydrophobic nanopores can undergo reversible wetting and dewetting due to condensation and evaporation of water inside the pores. The reversible process is observed as fluctuations between conducting and non-conducting ionic states and can be regulated by a transmembrane electric potential.},

abstract = {A computational method is developed to allow molecular dynamics simulations of biomembrane systems under realistic ionic gradients and asymmetric salt concentrations while maintaining the conventional periodic boundary conditions required to minimize finite-size effects in an all-atom explicit solvent representation. The method, which consists of introducing a nonperiodic energy step acting on the ionic species at the edge of the simulation cell, is first tested with illustrative applications to a simple membrane slab model and a phospholipid membrane bilayer. The nonperiodic energy-step method is then used to calculate the reversal potential of the bacterial porin OmpF, a large cation-specific $\beta$-barrel channel, by simulating the I-V curve under an asymmetric 10:1 KCl concentration gradient. The calculated reversal potential of 28.6 mV is found to be in excellent agreement with the values of 26-27 mV measured from lipid bilayer experiments, thereby demonstrating that the method allows realistic simulations of nonequilibrium membrane transport with quantitative accuracy. As a final example, the pore domain of Kv1.2, a highly selective voltage-activated K(+) channel, is simulated in a lipid bilayer under conditions that recreate, for the first time, the physiological K(+) and Na(+) concentration gradients and the electrostatic potential difference of living cells.},

(2) A significant increase in the rate of a catalytic reaction (oxidation of H2S in S) probably due to a microscopic increase of the partial pressure of H2S inside the nanotubes, produced by condensation and microcapillarity, while the macroscopic partial pressure outside the tubes remains unchanged. This phenomenon could be extended to many other reactions, with polar gaseous reactants which are prone to condensation by capillarity at the usual temperatures of catalytic reaction, or with liquid phase reaction by an overconcentration of one of the reactants inside the tubes.},

abstract = {Proteins usually undergo conformational transitions between structurally disparate states to fulfill their functions. The large-scale allosteric conformational transitions are believed to involve some key residues that mediate the conformational movements between different regions of the protein. In the present work, a thermodynamic method based on the elastic network model is proposed to predict the key residues involved in protein conformational transitions. In our method, the key functional sites are identified as the residues whose perturbations largely influence the free energy difference between the protein states before and after transition. Two proteins, nucleotide binding domain of the heat shock protein 70 and human/rat DNA polymerase $\beta$, are used as case studies to identify the critical residues responsible for their open-closed conformational transitions. The results show that the functionally important residues mainly locate at the following regions for these two proteins: (1) the bridging point at the interface between the subdomains that control the opening and closure of the binding cleft; (2) the hinge region between different subdomains, which mediates the cooperative motions between the corresponding subdomains; and (3) the substrate binding sites. The similarity in the positions of the key residues for these two proteins may indicate a common mechanism in their conformational transitions.},

abstract = {Today, despite the growing interest in nanofluidics, the descriptions of the many complex physical phenomena occurring at this scale remain scattered in the literature. Due to the additional complexity encountered when considering electrostatic nanofluidic gating, it is important to regroup several relevant theories and discuss them with regard to this application. In this work, we present a theoretical study of electrostatically gated phenomena and propose a model for the electrostatic gating of ion and molecular transport in nanochannels. In addition to the classical electrokinetic equations, that are reviewed in this work, several relevant phenomena are considered and combined to describe gating effects on nanofluidic properties more accurately. Dynamic surface charging is accounted for and is shown to be an essential element for electrostatic gating. The autoprotolysis of water is also considered to allow for accurate computing of the surface charge. Modifications of the Nernst-Planck equations are considered for more accurate computing of the concentration profiles at higher surface potentials by accounting for ion crowding near charge walls. The sensitivity of several parameters to the electric field and ion crowding is also studied. Each of these models is described separately before their implementation in a finite element model. The model is verified against previous experimental work. Finally, the model is used to simulate the tuning of the ionic current through the nanochannel via electrostatic gating. The influence of the additional models on these results is discussed. Guidelines for potentially better gating efficiencies are finally proposed. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Ligand-gated ion channel receptors mediate neuronal inhibition or excitation depending on their ion charge selectivity. An investigation into the determinants of ion charge selectivity of the anion-selective alpha1 homomeric glycine receptor (alpha1 glycine receptor [GlyR]) was undertaken using point mutations to residues lining the extra- and intracellular ends of the ion channel. Five mutant GlyRs were studied. A single substitution at the intracellular mouth of the channel (A-1'E GlyR) was sufficient to convert the channels to select cations over anions with P(Cl)/P(Na) = 0.34. This result delimits the selectivity filter and provides evidence that electrostatic interactions between permeating ions and pore residues are a critical factor in ion charge selectivity. The P-2'Delta mutant GlyR retained its anion selectivity (P(Cl)/P(Na) = 3.81), but it was much reduced compared with the wild-type (WT) GlyR (P(Cl)/P(Na) = 27.9). When the A-1'E and the P-2'Delta mutations were combined (selectivity double mutant [SDM] GlyR), the relative cation permeability was enhanced (P(Cl)/P(Na) = 0.13). The SDM GlyR was also Ca(2+) permeable (P(Ca)/P(Na) = 0.29). Neutralizing the extracellular mouth of the SDM GlyR ion channel (SDM+R19'A GlyR) produced a more Ca(2+)-permeable channel (P(Ca)/P(Na) = 0.73), without drastically altering monovalent charge selectivity (P(Cl)/P(Na) = 0.23). The SDM+R19'E GlyR, which introduces a negatively charged ring at the extracellular mouth of the channel, further enhanced Ca(2+) permeability (P(Ca)/P(Na) = 0.92), with little effect on monovalent selectivity (P(Cl)/P(Na) = 0.19). Estimates of the minimum pore diameter of the A-1'E, SDM, SDM+R19'A, and SDM+R19'E GlyRs revealed that these pores are larger than the alpha1 GlyR, with the SDM-based GlyRs being comparable in diameter to the cation-selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This result provides evidence that the diameter of the ion channel is also an important factor in ion charge selectivity.},

abstract = {We describe temperature-responsive protein pores containing single elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) loops. The ELP loops were placed within the cavity of the lumen of the alpha-hemolysin (alphaHL) pore, a heptamer of known crystal structure. The cavity is roughly spherical with a molecular surface volume of about 39,500 A3. In an applied potential, the wild-type alphaHL pore remained open for long periods. In contrast, the ELP loop-containing alphaHL pores exhibited transient current blockades, the nature of which depended on the length and sequence of the inserted loop. Together with similar results obtained with poly(ethylene glycols) covalently attached within the cavity, the data suggest that the transient current blockades are caused by excursions of ELP into the transmembrane beta-barrel domain of the pore. Below its transition temperature, the ELP loop is fully expanded and blocks the pore completely, but reversibly. Above its transition temperature, the ELP is dehydrated and the structure collapses, enabling a substantial flow of ions. Potential applications of temperature-responsive protein pores in medical biotechnology are discussed.},

abstract = {To understand the origin of transmembrane potentials, formation of transient pores, and the movement of anions and cations across lipid membranes, we have performed systematic atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) lipids. A double bilayer setup was employed and different transmembrane potentials were generated by varying the anion (Cl-) and cation (Na+) concentrations in the two water compartments. A transmembrane potential of approximately 350 mV was thereby generated per bilayer for a unit charge imbalance. For transmembrane potential differences of up to approximately 1.4 V, the bilayers were stable, over the time scale of the simulations (10-50 ns). At larger imposed potential differences, one of the two bilayers breaks down through formation of a water pore, leading to both anion and cation translocations through the pore. The anions typically have a short residence time inside the pore, while the cations show a wider range of residence times depending on whether they bind to a lipid molecule or not. Over the time scale of the simulations, we do not observe the discharge of the entire potential difference, nor do we observe pore closing, although we observe that the size of the pore decreases as more ions translocate. We also observed a rare lipid flip-flop, in which a lipid molecule translocated from one bilayer leaflet to the opposite leaflet, assisted by the water pore.},

abstract = {A number of membrane-active enzymes act in a complex environment formed by the interface between a lipid bilayer and bulk water. Although x-ray diffraction studies yield structures of isolated enzyme molecules, a detailed characterization of their interactions with the interface requires a measure of how deeply such a membrane-associated protein penetrates into a lipid bilayer. Here, we apply coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to probe the interaction of porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) with a lipid bilayer containing palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl choline and palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl glycerol molecules. We also used a configuration from a CG-MD trajectory to initiate two atomistic (AT) MD simulations. The results of the CG and AT simulations are evaluated by comparison with available experimental data. The membrane-binding surface of PLA2 consists of a patch of hydrophobic residues surrounded by polar and basic residues. We show this proposed footprint interacts preferentially with the anionic headgroups of the palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl glycerol molecules. Thus, both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions determine the location of PLA2 relative to the bilayer. From a general perspective, this study demonstrates that CG-MD simulations may be used to reveal the orientation and location of a membrane-surface-bound protein relative to a lipid bilayer, which may subsequently be refined by AT-MD simulations to probe more detailed interactions.},

abstract = {Improving our understanding of the mechanisms and effects of anesthetics is a critically important part of neuroscience. The currently dominant theory is that anesthetics and similar molecules act by binding to Cys-loop receptors in the postsynaptic terminal of nerve cells and potentiate or inhibit their function. Although structures for some of the most important mammalian channels have still not been determined, a number of important results have been derived from work on homologous cationic channels in bacteria. However, partly due to the lack of a nervous system in bacteria, there are a number of questions about how these results relate to higher organisms. The recent determination of a structure of the eukaryotic chloride channel, GluCl, is an important step toward accurate modeling of mammalian channels, because it is more similar in function to human Cys-loop receptors such as GABAAR or GlyR. One potential issue with using GluCl to model other receptors is the presence of the large ligand ivermectin (IVM) positioned between all five subunits. Here, we have performed a series of microsecond molecular simulations to study how the dynamics and structure of GluCl change in the presence versus absence of IVM. When the ligand is removed, subunits move at least 2 \AA closer to each other compared to simulations with IVM bound. In addition, the pore radius shrinks to 1.2 \AA, all of which appears to support a model where IVM binding between subunits stabilizes an open state, and that the relaxed nonIVM conformations might be suitable for modeling other channels. Interestingly, the presence of IVM also has an effect on the structure of the important loop C located at the neurotransmitter-binding pocket, which might help shed light on its partial agonist behavior. © 2013 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Recent advances in structural biology have revealed the architecture of a number of transmembrane channels, allowing for these complex biological systems to be understood in atomistic detail. Computational simulations are a powerful tool by which the dynamic and energetic properties, and thereby the function of these protein architectures, can be investigated. The experimentally observable properties of a system are often determined more by energetic than dynamics, and therefore understanding the underlying free energy (FE) of biophysical processes is of crucial importance. Critical to the accurate evaluation of FE values are the problems of obtaining accurate sampling of complex biological energy landscapes, and of obtaining accurate representations of the potential energy of a system, this latter problem having been addressed through the development of molecular force fields. While these challenges are common to all FE methods, depending on the system under study, and the questions being asked of it, one technique for FE calculation may be preferable to another, the choice of method and simulation protocol being crucial to achieve efficiency. Applied in a correct manner, FE calculations represent a predictive and affordable computational tool with which to make relevant contact with experiments. This chapter, therefore, aims to give an overview of the most widely implemented computational methods used to calculate the FE associated with particular biochemical or biophysical events, and to highlight their recent applications to ion channels.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of nanotechnology and biotechnology, nanoscale structures are increasingly used in cellular biology. However, the interface between artificial materials and a biological membrane is not well understood, and the harm caused by the interaction is poorly controlled. Here, we utilize the dissipative particle dynamics simulation method to study the interface when a nanoscale probe penetrates the cell membrane, and propose that an appropriate surface architecture can reduce the harm experienced by a cell membrane. The simulation shows that a hydrophilic probe generates a hydrophilic hole around the probe while a hydrophobic probe leads to a 'T-junction' state as some lipid molecules move toward the two ends of the probe. Both types of probe significantly disrupt lipid bilayer organization as reflected by the large variations in free energy associated with penetration of the membrane. Considering the hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of the lipid bilayer, three other hydrophilic/hydrophobic patterns - band pattern, axial pattern and random pattern - are discussed to reduce the damage to the lipid membrane. Both the free energy analysis and simulation studies show that the axial pattern and the random pattern can both minimize the variations in free energy with correspondingly smaller adverse effects on membrane function. These results suggest that the axial pattern or random pattern nanoprobe generates a mild interaction with the biological membrane, which should be considered when designing nondestructive nanoscale structures. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We discuss the difference between osmotic permeability pf and diffusion permeability pd of single-file water channels and demonstrate that the pf/pd ratio corresponds to the number of effective steps a water molecule needs to take to permeate a channel. While pd can be directly obtained from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, pf can be best determined from simulations in which a chemical potential difference of water has been established on the two sides of the channel. In light of this, we suggest a method to induce in molecular dynamics simulations a hydrostatic pressure difference across the membrane, from which pf can be measured. Simulations using this method are performed on aquaporin-1 channels in a lipid bilayer, resulting in a calculated pf of 7.1 x 10(-14) cm(3)/s, which is in close agreement with observation. Using a previously determined pd value, we conclude that pf/pd for aquaporin-1 measures approximately 12. This number is explained in terms of channel architecture and conduction mechanism.},

The monomeric porin OmpG is es- pecially attractive compared with multisubunit proteins because appropriate modifications of the pore can be easily achieved by mutagenesis. However, the gating of OmpG causes transient current blockades in single-channel recordings that would inter- fere with analyte detection. To eliminate this spontaneous gating activity, we used molecular dynamics simulations to identify re- gions ofOmpGimplicated in the gating. Based on our findings, two approaches were used to enhance the stability of the open con- formation by site-directed mutagenesis. First, the mobility of loop 6 was reduced by introducing a disulfide bond between the extracellular ends of strands 12 and hydrogen bonding between strands 13. Second, the interstrand 11 and 12 was optimized by deletion of residue D215. The OmpG porin with both stabilizing mutations exhibited a 95% reduction in gating activity. We used this mutant for the detection of adenosine diphosphate at the single-molecule level, after equipping the porin with a cyclodextrin molecular adapter, thereby demonstrating its potential for use in stochastic sensing applications},

abstract = {A parallel finite element simulator, ichannel, is developed for ion transport through three-dimensional ion channel systems that consist of protein and membrane. The coordinates of heavy atoms of the protein are taken from the Protein Data Bank and the membrane is represented as a slab. The simulator contains two components: a parallel adaptive finite element solver for a set of Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations that describe the electrodiffusion process of ion transport, and a mesh generation tool chain for ion channel systems, which is an essential component for the finite element computations. The finite element method has advantages in modeling irregular geometries and complex boundary conditions. We have built a tool chain to get the surface and volume mesh for ion channel systems, which consists of a set of mesh generation tools. The adaptive finite element solver in our simulator is implemented using the parallel adaptive finite element package Parallel Hierarchical Grid (PHG) developed by one of the authors, which provides the capability of doing large scale parallel computations with high parallel efficiency and the flexibility of choosing high order elements to achieve high order accuracy. The simulator is applied to a real transmembrane protein, the gramicidin A (gA) channel protein, to calculate the electrostatic potential, ion concentrations and I - V curve, with which both primitive and transformed PNP equations are studied and their numerical performances are compared. To further validate the method, we also apply the simulator to two other ion channel systems, the voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC) and $\alpha$-Hemolysin ($\alpha$-HL). The simulation results agree well with Brownian dynamics (BD) simulation results and experimental results. Moreover, because ionic finite size effects can be included in PNP model now, we also perform simulations using a size-modified PNP (SMPNP) model on VDAC and $\alpha$-HL. It is shown that the size effects in SMPNP can effectively lead to reduced current in the channel, and the results are closer to BD simulation results.},

Therefore, in an effort to relate electrophysiological measurements on MscS and properties of the MscS crystal conformation, we report here MscS's response to voltage and pressure as determined by patch-clamp experiments, as well as MscS electrostatics and transport properties as determined through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the protein embedded in a lipid bilayer, a 224,000-atom system. The experiments reveal that MscS is a slightly anion-selective channel with a conductance of approximately 1 ns, activated by pressure and inactivated in a voltage-dependent manner. On the other hand, the simulations, covering over 200 ns and including biasing electrostatic potentials, show that MscS restrained to the crystal conformation exhibits low conductance; unrestrained it increases the channel radius upon application of a large electrostatic bias and exhibits then ion conduction that matches experimentally determined conductances. The simulated conductance stems mainly from Cl- ions.},

The structure reveals the essential molecular architecture of ChRs, including the retinal-binding pocket and cation conduction pathway. This integration of structural and electrophysiological analyses provides insight into the molecular basis for the remarkable function of ChRs, and paves the way for the precise and principled design of ChR variants with novel properties.},

abstract = {K+ channels are transmembrane proteins that are essential for the transmission of nerve impulses. The ability of these proteins to conduct K+ ions at levels near the limit of diffusion is traditionally described in terms of concerted mechanisms in which ion-channel attraction and ion-ion repulsion have compensating effects, as several ions are moving simultaneously in single file through the narrow pore. The efficiency of such a mechanism, however, relies on a delicate energy balance-the strong ion-channel attraction must be perfectly counterbalanced by the electrostatic ion-ion repulsion. To elucidate the mechanism of ion conduction at the atomic level, we performed molecular dynamics free energy simulations on the basis of the X-ray structure of the KcsA K+ channel. Here we find that ion conduction involves transitions between two main states, with two and three K+ ions occupying the selectivity filter, respectively; this process is reminiscent of the 'knock-on' mechanism proposed by Hodgkin and Keynes in 1955. The largest free energy barrier is on the order of 2-3 kcal mol-1, implying that the process of ion conduction is limited by diffusion. Ion-ion repulsion, although essential for rapid conduction, is shown to act only at very short distances. The calculations show also that the rapidly conducting pore is selective.},

abstract = {Ion distribution and transport of KCl aqueous solutions at the junction of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions inside silica nanopores were studied by using two kinds of molecular simulation: grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. The nanopores were 2 nm diameter silica pores in which surface functional groups, -SiOH, had been modified by hydrophobic surface functional groups, -SiCH(3), within three different lengths along the pore direction (z-direction), L(z0) = 0, 2, and 4 nm. If L(z0) is long enough, water could not enter the hydrophobic region, but for all L(z0) studied here, water entered the hydrophobic region. When an external electric field was applied along the z-direction, ions could not pass through the hydrophobic region when the external electric field was less than a threshold level, E(0), whereas the ionic current increased relatively linearly with increasing electric field strength above E(0). In 2 nm diameter fluidic pores, the electrical potential barrier appeared at the junction between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions due to the difference in dipole moment of the surface functional groups, although the overall surface charge of the pore was neutral. This junction formed an electrical potential threshold, and the ionic current could be modulated by adjusting the external electric field.},

CNTs can be used to deliver a variety of therapeutic agents, including biomolecules, to the target disease sites. In addition, their unparalleled optical and electrical properties make them excellent candidates for bioimaging and other biomedical applications. However, the high cytotoxicity of CNTs limits their use in humans and many biological systems. The biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity of CNTs are attributed to size, dose, duration, testing systems, and surface functionalization. The functionalization of CNTs improves their solubility and biocompatibility and alters their cellular interaction pathways, resulting in much-reduced cytotoxic effects. Functionalized CNTs are promising novel materials for a variety of biomedical applications. These potential applications are particularly enhanced by their ability to penetrate biological membranes with relatively low cytotoxicity. This review is directed towards the overview of CNTs and their functionalization for biomedical applications with minimal cytotoxicity.},

abstract = {The interactions of triterpenoid monodesmosidic saponins, $\alpha$-hederin and $\delta$-hederin, with lipid membranes are involved in their permeabilizing effect. Unfortunately, the interactions of these saponins with lipid membranes are largely unknown, as are the roles of cholesterol or the branched sugar moieties (two for $\alpha$-hederin and one for $\delta$-hederin) on the aglycone backbone, hederagenin. The differences in sugar moieties are responsible for differences in the molecular shape of the saponins and the effects on membrane curvature that should be the most positive for $\alpha$-hederin in a transbilayer direction. In large unilamellar vesicles and monocyte cells, we showed that membrane permeabilization was dependent on the presence of membrane cholesterol and saponin sugar chains, being largest for $\alpha$-hederin and smallest for hederagenin. In the presence of cholesterol, $\alpha$-hederin induced the formation of nonbilayer phases with a higher rate of Brownian tumbling or lateral diffusion. A reduction of Laurdan's generalized polarization in relation to change in order of the polar heads of phospholipids was observed. Using giant unilamellar vesicles, we visualized the formation of wrinkled borders, the decrease in liposome size, budding, and the formation of macroscopic pores. All these processes are highly dependent on the sugars linked to the aglycone, with $\alpha$-hederin showing a greater ability to induce pore formation and $\delta$-hederin being more efficient in inducing budding. Hederagenin induced intravesicular budding but no pore formation. Based on these results, a curvature-driven permeabilization mechanism dependent on the interaction between saponin and sterols and on the molecular shape of the saponin and its ability to induce local spontaneous curvature is proposed.},

abstract = {Differential equation models that describe the dynamic changes of biochemical signaling states are important tools to understand cellular behavior. An essential task in building such representations is to infer the affinities, rate constants, and other parameters of a model from actual measurement data. However, intuitive measurement protocols often fail to generate data that restrict the range of possible parameter values. Here we utilized a numerical method to iteratively design optimal live-cell fluorescence microscopy experiments in order to reveal pharmacological and kinetic parameters of a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP(3)) second messenger signaling process that is deregulated in many tumors. The experimental approach included the activation of endogenous phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) by chemically induced recruitment of a regulatory peptide, reversible inhibition of PI3K using a kinase inhibitor, and monitoring of the PI3K-mediated production of PIP(3) lipids using the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt. We found that an intuitively planned and established experimental protocol did not yield data from which relevant parameters could be inferred. Starting from a set of poorly defined model parameters derived from the intuitively planned experiment, we calculated concentration-time profiles for both the inducing and the inhibitory compound that would minimize the predicted uncertainty of parameter estimates. Two cycles of optimization and experimentation were sufficient to narrowly confine the model parameters, with the mean variance of estimates dropping more than sixty-fold. Thus, optimal experimental design proved to be a powerful strategy to minimize the number of experiments needed to infer biological parameters from a cell signaling assay.},

The APC35832 protein is a representative of large group of bacterial and archeal proteins entirely consisting of the Toprim (topoisomerase-primase) domain. This domain is found in the catalytic centers of many enzymes catalyzing phosphodiester bond formation or cleavage, but the function of small Toprim domain proteins remains unknown. Consistent with the sequence analysis, the APC35832 structure shows a conserved Toprim fold, with a central 4-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by four alpha-helixes. Comparison of the APC35832 structure with its closest structural homolog, the catalytic core of bacteriophage T7 primase, revealed structural conservation of a metal binding site and isothermal titration calorimetry indicates that APC35832 binds Mg2+ with a sub-millimolar dissociation constant (K(d)). The APC35832-Mg2+ complex structure was determined at 1.65 A and reveals the role of conserved acidic residues in Mg2+ ion coordination. The structural similarities to other Toprim domain containing proteins and potential function and substrates of APC35832 are discussed in this article.},

abstract = {Values of $\Delta$Gs(g → aq) and $\Delta$Gs(liq → aq) at 298 K are documented for 14 homologous series of gaseous and liquid solutes, and corresponding enthalpies of solution listed for 7 homologous series. It is shown by a thermodynamic argument that only parameters for the process g → aq can be used to assess solute–water interactions and that the standard state of pure liquid solute includes a different solute–solute interaction term for each solute standard state. For most of the homologous series, parameters for the process g → aq are linear in the number of carbon atoms in the solute; from such linear equations, methylene and group contributions are obtained. It is shown that the methylene increments to $\Delta$Gs(g → aq) and to $\Delta$Hs(g → aq) are not constant but vary from one homologous series to another. In a few homologous series the methylene increment is not constant, the most outstanding examples being the alkan-1-ols and n-alkanes. Above dodecan-1-ol, $\Delta$Gs(g → aq) becomes gradually more negative than expected, so that octadecan-1-ol is 16 times as soluble as calculated from results on the low alkan-1-ols. A similar, but much larger, effect is observed for the n-alkanes: n-octadecane is more soluble than expected by a factor of 5 × 103(the factor for n-hexatriacontane is 2 × 1018) and it is deduced that the n-alkane C51H104 will be as soluble in water as in the non-aqueous solvents ethanol and phenol.},

abstract = {One major challenge of nanopore-based DNA sequencing technology is to find an efficient way to reduce DNA translocation speed so that each nucleotide can reside long enough in the pore for interrogation. Here we report the electrical tuning of DNA translocation speed by gate modulation of nanopore wall surface charges. We find that native surface-charge-induced counterions in the electroosmotic layer substantially enhance advection flow of fluid, which exerts stronger dragging forces on the translocating DNA, and thereby lowering the DNA translocation speed. We propose a feedback device architecture to regulate DNA translocation by modulating the effective wall surface charge density $\sigma$w*via lateral gate voltages--at the beginning, a positive gate bias is applied to weaken $\sigma$w* in order to enhance the capture rate of DNA molecule; upon detection of ionic current variance indicating DNA has been driven into the nanopore, gate bias is turned to be negative so that $\sigma$w* is reinforced and DNA translocation is retarded. We show that a gate electric field can dramatically decrease the DNA translocation speed at a rate about 55 $\mu$m/s per 1 mV/nm.},

abstract = {Each species from bacteria to human has a distinct genetic fingerprint. Therefore, a mechanism that detects a single molecule of DNA represents the ultimate analytical tool. As a first step in the development of such a tool, we have explored using a nanometer-diameter pore, sputtered in a nanometer-thick inorganic membrane with a tightly focused electron beam, as a transducer that detects single molecules of DNA and produces an electrical signature of the structure. When an electric field is applied across the membrane, a DNA molecule immersed in electrolyte is attracted to the pore, blocks the current through it, and eventually translocates across the membrane as verified unequivocally by gel electrophoresis. The relationship between DNA translocation and blocking current has been established through molecular dynamics simulations. By measuring the duration and magnitude of the blocking current transient, we can discriminate single-stranded from double-stranded DNA and resolve the length of the polymer.},

abstract = {Superhydrophobic nanocoatings, a combination of nanotechnology and superhydrophobic surfaces, have received extraordinary attention recently, focusing both on novel preparation strategies and on investigations of their unique properties. In the past few decades, inspired by the lotus leaf, the discovery of nano- and micro-hierarchical structures has brought about great change in the superhydrophobic nanocoatings field. In this paper we review the contributions to this field reported in recent literature, mainly including materials, fabrication and applications. In order to facilitate comparison, materials are divided into 3 categories as follows: inorganic materials, organic materials, and inorganic-organic materials. Each kind of materials has itself merits and demerits, as well as fabrication techniques. The process of each technique is illustrated simply through a few classical examples. There is, to some extent, an association between various fabrication techniques, but many are different. So, it is important to choose appropriate preparation strategies, according to conditions and purposes. The peculiar properties of superhydrophobic nanocoatings, such as self-cleaning, anti-bacteria, anti-icing, corrosion resistance and so on, are the most dramatic. Not only do we introduce application examples, but also try to briefly discuss the principle behind the phenomenon. Finally, some challenges and potential promising breakthroughs in this field are also succinctly highlighted.},

abstract = {A single-molecule method for sequencing DNA that does not require fluorescent labelling could reduce costs and increase sequencing speeds. An exonuclease enzyme might be used to cleave individual nucleotide molecules from the DNA, and when coupled to an appropriate detection system, these nucleotides could be identified in the correct order. Here, we show that a protein nanopore with a covalently attached adapter molecule can continuously identify unlabelled nucleoside 5'-monophosphate molecules with accuracies averaging 99.8%. Methylated cytosine can also be distinguished from the four standard DNA bases: guanine, adenine, thymine and cytosine. The operating conditions are compatible with the exonuclease, and the kinetic data show that the nucleotides have a high probability of translocation through the nanopore and, therefore, of not being registered twice. This highly accurate tool is suitable for integration into a system for sequencing nucleic acids and for analysing epigenetic modifications.},

abstract = {N-Acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) is the first committed intermediate in sialic acid metabolism. Thus, the mechanisms that control intracellular ManNAc levels are important regulators of sialic acid production. In prokaryotic organisms, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) 2-epimerase and GlcNAc-6-P 2-epimerase are two enzymes capable of generating ManNAc from UDP-GlcNAc and GlcNAc-6-P, respectively. We have purified for the first time native GlcNAc-6-P 2-epimerase from bacterial source to apparent homogeneity (1 200 fold) using Butyl-agarose, DEAE-FPLC and Mannose-6-P-agarose chromatography. By SDS/PAGE the pure enzyme showed a molecular mass of 38.4 +/- 0.2 kDa. The maximum activity was achieved at pH 7.8 and 37 degrees C. Under these conditions, the K(m) calculated for GlcNAc-6-P was 1.5 mM. The 2-epimerase activity was activated by Na(+) and inhibited by mannose-6-P but not mannose-1-P. Genetic analysis revealed high homology with bacterial isomerases. GlcNAc-6-P 2-epimerase from E. coli K92 is a ManNAc-inducible protein and is detected from the early logarithmic phase of growth. Our results indicate that, unlike UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase, which promotes the biosynthesis of sialic acid, GlcNAc-6-P 2-epimerase plays a catabolic role. When E. coli grows using ManNAc as a carbon source, this enzyme converts the intracellular ManNAc-6-P generated into GlcNAc-6-P, diverting the metabolic flux of ManNAc to GlcNAc.},

abstract = {In the current report, we provide a quantitative analysis of the convergence of the sampling of conformational space accomplished in molecular dynamics simulations of membrane proteins of duration in the order of 10 nanoseconds. A set of proteins of diverse size and topology is considered, ranging from helical pores such as gramicidin and small beta-barrels such as OmpT, to larger and more complex structures such as rhodopsin and FepA. Principal component analysis of the C(alpha)-atom trajectories was employed to assess the convergence of the conformational sampling in both the transmembrane domains and the whole proteins, while the time-dependence of the average structure was analyzed to obtain single-domain information. The membrane-embedded regions, particularly those of small or structurally simple proteins, were found to achieve reasonable convergence. By contrast, extra-membranous domains lacking secondary structure are often markedly under-sampled, exhibiting a continuous structural drift. This drift results in a significant imprecision in the calculated B-factors, which detracts from any quantitative comparison to experimental data. In view of such limitations, we suggest that similar analyses may be valuable in simulation studies of membrane protein dynamics, in order to attach a level of confidence to any biologically relevant observations.},

abstract = {Despite the large number of studies available on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, a complete account of the mechanistic aspects of their gating transition in response to ligand binding still remains elusive. As a first step toward dissecting the transition mechanism by accelerated sampling techniques, we study the ligand-induced conformational changes of the acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP), a widely accepted model for the full receptor extracellular domain. Using unbiased Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Temperature Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (TAMD) simulations we investigate the AChBP transition between the apo and the agonist-bound state. In long standard MD simulations, both conformations of the native protein are stable, while the agonist-bound structure evolves toward the apo one if the orientation of few key sidechains in the orthosteric cavity is modified. Conversely, TAMD simulations initiated from the native conformations are able to produce the spontaneous transition. With respect to the modified conformations, TAMD accelerates the transition by at least a factor 10. The analysis of some specific residue-residue interactions points out that the transition mechanism is based on the disruption/formation of few key hydrogen bonds. Finally, while early events of ligand dissociation are observed already in standard MD, TAMD accelerates the ligand detachment and, at the highest TAMD effective temperature, it is able to produce a complete dissociation path in one AChBP subunit.},

abstract = {Channels formed by membrane proteins regulate the transport of water, ions or nutrients that are essential to cells' metabolism. Recent advances in nanotechnology allow us to fabricate solid-state nanopores for transporting and analyzing biomolecules. However, uncontrollable surface properties of a fabricated nanopore cause irregular transport of biomolecules, limiting potential biomimetic applications. Here we show that a nanopore functionalized with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) can potentially regulate the transport of a DNA molecule by changing functional groups of the SAM. We found that an enhanced interaction between DNA and a SAM-coated nanopore can slow down the translocation speed of DNA molecules and increase the DNA capture-rate. Our results demonstrate that the transport of DNA molecules inside nanopores could be modulated by coating a SAM on the pore surface. Our method to control the DNA motion inside a nanopore may find its applications in nanopore-based DNA sequencing devices.},

abstract = {When applied on intact cell suspension, electric field pulses are known to induce membrane permeabilization (electropermeabilization) and fusion (electrofusion). These effects are triggered through a modulation of the membrane potential difference. Due to the vectorial character of the electric field effects, this modulation, which is superimposed on the resting membrane potential difference, is position-dependent on the cell surface. This explains the difference between the experimentally observed critical field strengths requested to trigger the processes of permeabilization and fusion. The critical membrane potential difference which induces membrane permeabilization can be calculated from these experimental observations. It is observed that its value is always about 200 mV for many different cell systems as we previously reported in the case of pure lipid vesicles. This is much less than assumed in most previous studies.},

Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student-who was randomly assigned either a male or female name-for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants' preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.},

It consists of a regular, extended eight-stranded beta-barrel and appears to be constructed like an inverse micelle with large water-filled cavities, but does not form a pore. Surprisingly, the cavities seem to be highly conserved during evolution. The structure corroborates the concept that all outer membrane proteins consist of beta-barrels.

abstract = {Manipulating DNA translocation through nanopore is one crucial requirement for new ultrafast sequencing methods in the sense that the polymers have to be denatured, unraveled, and then propelled through the pore with very low speed. Here we propose and theoretically explore a novel design to fulfill the demands by utilizing cross-pore thermal gradient. The high temperature in the cis reservoir is expected to transform double-stranded DNA into single strands and that temperature would also prevent those single strands from intrastrand base-pairing, thus, achieving favorable polymer conformation for the subsequent translocation and sequencing. Then, the substantial temperature drop across the pore caused by the thermal-insulating membrane separating cis and trans chambers would stimulate thermophoresis of the molecules through nanopores. Our theoretical evaluation shows that the DNA translocation speeds will be orders smaller than the electrophoretic counterpart, while high capture rate of DNA into nanopore is maintained, both of which would greatly benefit the sequencing.},

abstract = {Protein secretion in bacteria is driven through the ubiquitous SecYEG complex by the ATPase SecA. The structure of SecYEG alone or as a complex with SecA in detergent reveal a monomeric heterotrimer enclosing a central protein channel, yet in membranes it is dimeric. We have addressed the functional significance of the oligomeric status of SecYEG in protein translocation using single molecule and ensemble methods. The results show that while monomers are sufficient for the SecA- and ATP-dependent association of SecYEG with pre-protein, active transport requires SecYEG dimers arranged in the back-to-back conformation. Molecular modeling of this dimeric structure, in conjunction with the new functional data, provides a rationale for the presence of both active and passive copies of SecYEG in the functional translocon.},

Although such studies have already begun to provide new insights into the process of protein folding, realizing the full potential of this approach will depend not only on simulation speed, but on the accuracy of the physical models ('force fields') on which such simulations are based. While experimental data are not available for comparison with all of the salient characteristics observable in long protein-folding simulations, we examine here the extent to which current force fields reproduce (and fail to reproduce) certain relevant properties for which such comparisons are possible. © 2013 The Authors.},

The effect of ion-current rectification is observed as asymmetric current–voltage (I–V) curves, with the current recorded for one voltage polarity higher than the current recorded for the same absolute value of voltage of opposite polarity. This diode-like I–V curve indicates that there is a preferential direction for ion flow. Experimental evidence that ion-current rectification is inherent to asymmetric, e.g., tapered, nanoporous systems with excess surface charge is provided and discussed. The fabrication and operation of asymmetric polymer nanopores, gold nanotubes, glass nanocapillaries, and silicon nanopores are presented. The possibility of tuning the direction and extent of rectification is discussed in detail. Theoretical models that have been developed to explain the ion-current rectification effect are also presented.},

abstract = {The behaviour of lipid bilayer membranes, made of oxidized cholesterol, and UO22+-modified azolectin membranes in a high electric field has been investigated using the voltage clamp method. When a voltage pulse is applied to the membrane of these compositions, the mechanical rupture of the membranes is preceded by a gradual conductance increase which remains quite reversible till a certain moment. The voltage drop at this reversible stage of breakdown leads to a very rapid (characteristic time of less than 5 $\mu$s) decrease in the membrane conductance. At repeated voltage pulses of the same amplitude with sufficient intervals between them (approx. 10 s), the current oscillograms reflecting the reversible resistance decrease are well reproduced on the same membrane. The time of attainment of the predetermined level of the membrane conductance is strongly dependent on voltage. At different stages of breakdown we have investigated changes in the conductance of UO22+-modified membrane after the application of two-step voltage pulses, the kinetics of development of the reversible decrease in the membrane resistance in solutions of univalent and divalent ions, and also the influence of sucrose and hemoglobin on the current evolution. The relationship between the reversible conductance increase, the reversible electrical breakdown [15] and the rupture of membrane in an electric field is discussed. We propose the general interpretation of these phenomena, based on the representation of the potential-dependent appearance in the membrane of pores, the development of which is promoted by an electric field.},

abstract = {To understand the origin of transmembrane potentials, formation of transient pores, and the movement of anions and cations across lipid membranes, we have performed systematic atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) lipids. A double bilayer setup was employed and different transmembrane potentials were generated by varying the anion (Cl-) and cation (Na+) concentrations in the two water compartments. A transmembrane potential of approximately 350 mV was thereby generated per bilayer for a unit charge imbalance. For transmembrane potential differences of up to approximately 1.4 V, the bilayers were stable, over the time scale of the simulations (10-50 ns). At larger imposed potential differences, one of the two bilayers breaks down through formation of a water pore, leading to both anion and cation translocations through the pore. The anions typically have a short residence time inside the pore, while the cations show a wider range of residence times depending on whether they bind to a lipid molecule or not. Over the time scale of the simulations, we do not observe the discharge of the entire potential difference, nor do we observe pore closing, although we observe that the size of the pore decreases as more ions translocate. We also observed a rare lipid flip-flop, in which a lipid molecule translocated from one bilayer leaflet to the opposite leaflet, assisted by the water pore.},

abstract = {The FadL family of proteins is responsible for the transport of hydrophobic compounds across the bacterial outer membrane. Two crystal structures of FadL, the long-chain fatty acid transporter from Escherichia coli, were recently determined, showing a novel fold characterized by the combination of a 14-stranded ?? barrel and a 'hatch' domain that plugs the barrel. Both crystal forms have several bound detergent molecules in the interior of the protein. This, together with differences between the N-terminal conformations of the FadL structures, has led to the proposal of a transport model that is distinct from those of all other known outer membrane transporters. According to this model, the transport of hydrophobic substrates across the outer membrane, as mediated by FadL family members, is based on diffusion, coupled to spontaneous conformational changes in the hatch domain. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We have developed a method of molecular simulations utilizing a polarizable force field in combination with the theory of energy representation (ER) for the purpose of establishing an efficient and accurate methodology to compute solvation free energies. The standard version of the ER method is, however, based on the assumption that the solute-solvent interaction is pairwise additive for its construction. A crucial step in the present method is to introduce an intermediate state in the solvation process to treat separately the many-body interaction associated with the polarizable model. The intermediate state is chosen so that the solute-solvent interaction can be formally written in the pairwise form, though the solvent molecules are interacting with each other with polarizable charges dependent on the solvent configuration. It is, then, possible to extract the free energy contribution $\delta$$\mu$ due to the many-body interaction between solute and solvent from the total solvation free energy $\Delta$$\mu$. It is shown that the free energy $\delta$$\mu$ can be computed by an extension of the recent development implemented in quantum mechanical∕molecular mechanical simulations. To assess the numerical robustness of the approach, we computed the solvation free energies of a water and a methanol molecule in water solvent, where two paths for the solvation processes were examined by introducing different intermediate states. The solvation free energies of a water molecule associated with the two paths were obtained as -5.3 and -5.8 kcal∕mol. Those of a methanol molecule were determined as -3.5 and -3.7 kcal∕mol. These results of the ER simulations were also compared with those computed by a numerically exact approach. It was demonstrated that the present approach produces the solvation free energies in comparable accuracies to simulations of thermodynamic integration (TI) method within a tenth of computational time used for the TI simulations.},

While some of the proposed applications remain still a far-off dream, others are close to technical realization. Recent advances in the development of reliable methods for the chemical functionalization of the nanotubes provide an additional impetus towards extending the scope of their application spectrum.

abstract = {The neuronal alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is one of the most widely expressed nAChR subtypes in the brain. Its subunits have high sequence identity (54 and 46% for alpha4 and beta2, respectively) with alpha and beta subunits in Torpedo nAChR. Using the known structure of the Torpedo nAChR as a template, the closed-channel structure of the alpha4beta2 nAChR was constructed through homology modeling. Normal-mode analysis was performed on this closed structure and the resulting lowest frequency mode was applied to it for a "twist-to-open" motion, which increased the minimum pore radius from 2.7 to 3.4 A and generated an open-channel model. Nicotine could bind to the predicted agonist binding sites in the open-channel model but not in the closed one. Both models were subsequently equilibrated in a ternary lipid mixture via extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Over the course of 11 ns MD simulations, the open channel remained open with filled water, but the closed channel showed a much lower water density at its hydrophobic gate comprised of residues alpha4-V259 and alpha4-L263 and their homologous residues in the beta2 subunits. Brownian dynamics simulations of Na+ permeation through the open channel demonstrated a current-voltage relationship that was consistent with experimental data on the conducting state of alpha4beta2 nAChR. Besides establishment of the well-equilibrated closed- and open-channel alpha4beta2 structural models, the MD simulations on these models provided valuable insights into critical factors that potentially modulate channel gating. Rotation and tilting of TM2 helices led to changes in orientations of pore-lining residue side chains. Without concerted movement, the reorientation of one or two hydrophobic side chains could be enough for channel opening. The closed- and open-channel structures exhibited distinct patterns of electrostatic interactions at the interface of extracellular and transmembrane domains that might regulate the signal propagation of agonist binding to channel opening. A potential prominent role of the beta2 subunit in channel gating was also elucidated in the study.},

This unique construct succeeds in distributing a pair of charges over four rings and many atoms in a low dielectric environment to minimize charge repulsion. These dimers form with identical pKas of 8.2 +/- 0.2, suggesting cooperative H+ binding and clearly illustrating high H+ affinity for this channel. The protonation behavior of the histidine side chains has been characterized by using solid-state NMR spectroscopy on the M2 transmembrane domain in fully hydrated lipid bilayers where the tetrameric backbone structure is known. Furthermore, electrophysiological measurements of multichannel and single-channel experiments confirm that these protein constructs are functional.},

abstract = {We present molecular dynamics simulations of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) lipid bilayers in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The MD simulations focus on understanding the effect of 3 mol % DMSO on structural and permeation properties of DMPC bilayers. The potential of mean force (PMF) and the diffusivity profiles along the normal direction to the bilayer were calculated for water and DMSO molecules in systems containing 0 and 3 mol % DMSO. The simulation results indicate that while the presence of DMSO has only a small effect on diffusion coefficients of both water and DMSO molecules, it affects significantly the corresponding trans-membrane free energy profiles. Using the free energy profiles and diffusivities for water and DMSO and by employing an inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model we calculated the permeability coefficients. Our simulations show that the increase of the concentration of DMSO in the solution to 3 mol % leads to a significant increase, by about 3 times, of the permeability of water through a DMPC bilayer; a permeability increase that might explain in part the unusual ability of DMSO, even at relatively low concentrations, to reduce the osmotic pressure imbalance present during cryopreservation protocols.},

abstract = {In this work, we study the wetting of a surface decorated with one nanogroove by a bulk Lennard-Jones liquid at various temperatures and densities. We used atomistic simulations aimed at computing the free energy of the stable and metastable states of the system, as well as the intermediate states separating them. We found that the usual description in terms of Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel states is insufficient, as the system presents two states of the Cassie-Baxter type. These states are characterized by different curvatures of the meniscus. The measured free energy barrier separating the Cassie-Baxter from the Wenzel state (and vice versa) largely exceeds the thermal energy, attesting the existence of Cassie-Baxter/Wenzel metastabilities. Finally, we found that the Cassie-Baxter/Wenzel transition follows an asymmetric path, with the formation of a liquid finger on one side of the groove and a vapor bubble on the opposite side.},

abstract = {The transport of biomolecules across cell boundaries is central to cellular function. While structures of many membrane channels are known, the permeation mechanism is known only for a select few. Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computational method that can provide an accurate description of permeation events at the atomic level, which is required for understanding the transport mechanism. However, due to the relatively short time scales accessible to this method, it is of limited utility. Here, we present a method for all-atom simulation of electric field-driven transport of large solutes through membrane channels, which in tens of nanoseconds can provide a realistic account of a permeation event that would require a millisecond simulation using conventional MD. In this method, the average distribution of the electrostatic potential in a membrane channel under a transmembrane bias of interest is determined first from an all-atom MD simulation. This electrostatic potential, defined on a grid, is subsequently applied to a charged solute to steer its permeation through the membrane channel. We apply this method to investigate permeation of DNA strands, DNA hairpins, and alpha-helical peptides through alpha-hemolysin. To test the accuracy of the method, we computed the relative permeation rates of DNA strands having different sequences and global orientations. The results of the G-SMD simulations were found to be in good agreement in experiment.},

Biomimetic design will facilitate production of stable synthetic nanopores with defined functionality. Bacterial porins offer a good source of possible templates for such nanopores as they form stable, selective pores in lipid bilayers. Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to design simple model nanopores with permeation free energy profiles that can be made to mimic a template protein, the OprP porin, which forms pores selective for anions. In particular, we explored the effects of varying the nature of pore-lining groups on free energy profiles for phosphate and chloride ions along the pore axis and the total charge of the permeation pathway of the pore. Cationic side chains lining the model nanopore are required to model the local detail of the OprP permeation landscape, whereas the total charge contributes to its magnitude. These studies indicate that a locally accurate biomimetic design has captured the essentials of the structure/function relationship of the parent protein.},

We performed normal mode analysis on the complete three-dimensional model to explore protein flexibility. Among the first 10 lowest frequency modes, only the first mode produces a structural reorganization compatible with channel gating: a wide opening of the channel pore caused by a concerted symmetrical quaternary twist motion of the protein with opposing rotations of the upper (extracellular) and lower (transmembrane) domains. Still, significant reorganizations are observed within each subunit, that involve their bending at the domain interface, an increase of angle between the two beta-sheets composing the extracellular domain, the internal beta-sheet being significantly correlated to the movement of the M2 alpha-helical segment. This global symmetrical twist motion of the pentameric protein complex, which resembles the opening transition of other multimeric ion channels, reasonably accounts for the available experimental data and thus likely describes the nAChR gating process.},

Assoc. 287, 2236-2252) requires innovative technologies and approaches to understand the mechanisms of toxin action and to develop better therapies. Anthrax toxins are formed from three proteins secreted by fully virulent Bacillus anthracis, protective antigen (PA, 83 kDa), lethal factor (LF, 90 kDa), and edema factor (EF, 89 kDa). Here we present electrophysiological measurements demonstrating that full-length LF and EF convert the current-voltage relationship of the heptameric PA63 ion channel from slightly nonlinear to highly rectifying and diode-like at pH 6.6. This effect provides a novel method for characterizing functional toxin interactions. The method confirms that a previously well characterized PA63 monoclonal antibody, which neutralizes anthrax lethal toxin in animals in vivo and in vitro, prevents the binding of LF to the PA63 pore. The technique can also detect the presence of anthrax lethal toxin complex from plasma of infected animals. The latter two results suggest the potential application of PA63 nanopore-based biosensors in anthrax therapeutics and diagnostics.},

It is shown that the requirement to exclude solvent from the barrel interior, while at the same time keeping an upper limit on strand twist and interstrand distance so as to foster extensive hydrogen bonding interactions within the sheet, imposes strong constraints on barrel geometry. A formal description of the relationships between beta-sheet twist, strand number, and barrel dimensions is given here.

Here we report the first X-ray crystal structure of a mammalian UT, UT-B, at a resolution of 2.36 Å. UT-B is a homotrimer and each protomer contains a urea conduction pore with a narrow selectivity filter. Structural analyses and molecular dynamics simulations showed that the selectivity filter has two urea binding sites separated by an approximately 5.0 kcal/mol energy barrier. Functional studies showed that the rate of urea conduction in UT-B is increased by hypoosmotic stress, and that the site of osmoregulation coincides with the location of the energy barrier.},

Here we report a means of fashioning matter at these dimensions that uses low-energy ion beams and reveals surprising atomic transport phenomena that occur in a variety of materials and geometries. The method is implemented in a feedback-controlled sputtering system that provides fine control over ion beam exposure and sample temperature. We call the method "ion-beam sculpting", and apply it to the problem of fabricating a molecular-scale hole, or nanopore, in a thin insulating solid-state membrane. Such pores can serve to localize molecular-scale electrical junctions and switches and function as masks to create other small-scale structures. Nanopores also function as membrane channels in all living systems, where they serve as extremely sensitive electro-mechanical devices that regulate electric potential, ionic flow, and molecular transport across cellular membranes. We show that ion-beam sculpting can be used to fashion an analogous solid-state device: a robust electronic detector consisting of a single nanopore in a Si3N4 membrane, capable of registering single DNA molecules in aqueous solution.},

Stochastic pore blocking is observed when individual cations partition into the nanotube obstructing an otherwise stable proton current. The observed oscillations occur because of coupling between pore blocking and a proton-diffusion limitation at the pore mouth. The result illustrates how simple ionic transport can generate coherent waveforms within an inherently noisy environment and points to new types of nanoreactors, sensors, and nanofluidic channels based on this platform.},

In this respect, nanopores with built-in stimulus-responsive properties are of special benefit. A transmembrane potential is a particularly useful stimulus as it is non-invasive, tunable, and can act over a short time scale. This critical review considers engineered solid-state and protein nanopores with voltage-responsive properties.

abstract = {Electric fields promote pore formation in both biological and model membranes. We clamped unmodified planar bilayers at 150-550 mV to monitor transient single pores for a long period of time. We observed fast transitions between different conductance levels reflecting opening and closing of metastable lipid pores. Although mean lifetime of the pores was 3 +/- 0.8 ms (250 mV), some pores remained open for up to approximately 1 s. The mean amplitude of conductance fluctuations (approximately 500 pS) was independent of voltage and close for bilayers of different area (40,000 and 10 microm(2)), indicating the local nature of the conductive defects. The distribution of pore conductance was rather broad (dispersion of approximately 250 pS). Based on the conductance value and its dependence of the ion size, the radius of the average pore was estimated as approximately 1 nm. Short bursts of conductance spikes (opening and closing of pores) were often separated by periods of background conductance. Within the same burst the conductance between spikes was indistinguishable from the background. The mean time interval between spikes in the burst was much smaller than that between adjacent bursts. These data indicate that opening and closing of lipidic pores proceed through some electrically invisible (silent) pre-pores. Similar pre-pore defects and metastable conductive pores might be involved in remodeling of cell membranes in different biologically relevant processes.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels from the Cys-loop family mediate fast chemo-electrical transduction, but the mechanisms of ion permeation and gating of these membrane proteins remain elusive. Here we present the X-ray structure at 2.9 A resolution of the bacterial Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel homologue (GLIC) at pH 4.6 in an apparently open conformation. This cationic channel is known to be permanently activated by protons. The structure is arranged as a funnel-shaped transmembrane pore widely open on the outer side and lined by hydrophobic residues. On the inner side, a 5 A constriction matches with rings of hydrophilic residues that are likely to contribute to the ionic selectivity. Structural comparison with ELIC, a bacterial homologue from Erwinia chrysanthemi solved in a presumed closed conformation, shows a wider pore where the narrow hydrophobic constriction found in ELIC is removed. Comparative analysis of GLIC and ELIC reveals, in concert, a rotation of each extracellular beta-sandwich domain as a rigid body, interface rearrangements, and a reorganization of the transmembrane domain, involving a tilt of the M2 and M3 alpha-helices away from the pore axis. These data are consistent with a model of pore opening based on both quaternary twist and tertiary deformation.},

abstract = {The molecular structure of the yeast nuclear pore complex (NPC) and the translocation of model particles have been studied with a molecular theory that accounts for the geometry of the pore and the sequence and anchoring position of the unfolded domains of the nucleoporin proteins (the FG-Nups), which control selective transport through the pore. The theory explicitly models the electrostatic, hydrophobic, steric, conformational, and acid-base properties of the FG-Nups. The electrostatic potential within the pore, which arises from the specific charge distribution of the FG-Nups, is predicted to be negative close to pore walls and positive along the pore axis. The positive electrostatic potential facilitates the translocation of negatively charged particles, and the free energy barrier for translocation decreases for increasing particle hydrophobicity. These results agree with the experimental observation that transport receptors that form complexes with hydrophilic/neutral or positively charged proteins to transport them through the NPC are both hydrophobic and strongly negatively charged. The molecular theory shows that the effects of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions on the translocating potential are cooperative and nonequivalent due to the interaction-dependent reorganization of the FG-Nups in the presence of the translocating particle. The combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions can give rise to complex translocation potentials displaying a combination of wells and barriers, in contrast to the simple barrier potential observed for a hydrophilic/neutral translocating particle. This work demonstrates the importance of explicitly considering the amino acid sequence and hydrophobic, electrostatic, and steric interactions in understanding the translocation through the NPC.},

Long simulations of each end-state allowed for the partitioning of the free energy into its energetic and entropic components. The calculations revealed that the initial loading states are dominated by entropic (both translational and rotational) components, whereas the latter stages are energetically driven by strong dipolar interactions among the water molecules in the file.},

To investigate structural bases for the dynamics (MD) simulations, X-ray crystallography, and single channel recording. MD simulations of the muscle nicotinic receptor, imbedded in a lipid bilayer with an applied transmembrane potential, reveal single cation translocation events during transient periods of channel hydration. During the simulation trajectory, cations paused for prolonged periods near several rings of anionic residues projecting from the lumen of the extracellular domain of the receptor, but subsequently the cation moved rapidly through the hydrophobic transmembrane region as the constituent alpha-helices exhibited back and forth rocking motions. Cocrystallization of acetylcholine binding protein with sulfate ions revealed coordination of five sulfates with residues from one of these charged rings; in cation-selective Cys-loop receptors this ring contains negatively charged residues, whereas in anion-selective receptors it contains positively charged residues. In the muscle nicotinic receptor, charge reversal of residues of this ring decreases unitary conductance by up to 80%. Thus in Cys-loop receptors, a series of charged rings along the ion translocation pathway concentrates hydrated ions relative to bulk solution, giving rise to charge selectivity, and then subtle motions of the hydrophobic transmembrane, coupled with transient periods of water filling, enable rapid ion flux.},

However, using aqueous dispersions to fabricate composites with specific physical properties requires that the processing of the nanotube dispersion be understood and controlled while in the liquid phase. Here, using a combination of experiment and theory, we study the electrical percolation of carbon nanotubes introduced into a polymer matrix, and show that the percolation threshold can be substantially lowered by adding small quantities of a conductive polymer latex. Mixing colloidal particles of different sizes and shapes (in this case, spherical latex particles and rod-like nanotubes) introduces competing length scales that can strongly influence the formation of the system-spanning networks that are needed to produce electrically conductive composites. Interplay between the different species in the dispersions leads to synergetic or antagonistic percolation, depending on the ease of charge transport between the various conductive components.},

abstract = {Aquaporins are transmembrane channels found in cell membranes of all life forms. We examine their apparently paradoxical property, facilitation of efficient permeation of water while excluding protons, which is of critical importance to preserving the electrochemical potential across the cell membrane. We have determined the structure of the Escherichia coli aquaglyceroporin GlpF with bound water, in native (2.7 angstroms) and in W48F/F200T mutant (2.1 angstroms) forms, and carried out 12-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations that define the spatial and temporal probability distribution and orientation of a single file of seven to nine water molecules inside the channel. Two conserved asparagines force a central water molecule to serve strictly as a hydrogen bond donor to its neighboring water molecules. Assisted by the electrostatic potential generated by two half-membrane spanning loops, this dictates opposite orientations of water molecules in the two halves of the channel, and thus prevents the formation of a "proton wire," while permitting rapid water diffusion. Both simulations and observations revealed a more regular distribution of channel water and an increased water permeability for the W48F/F200T mutant.},

abstract = {Integral membrane proteins come in two types, alpha-helical and beta-barrel proteins. In both types, all hydrogen bonding donors and acceptors of the polypeptide backbone are completely compensated and buried while nonpolar side chains point to the membrane. The alpha-helical type is more abundant and occurs in cytoplasmic (or inner) membranes, whereas the beta-barrels are known from outer membranes of bacteria. The beta-barrel construction is described by the number of strands and the shear number, which is a measure for the inclination angle of the beta-strands against the barrel axis. The common right-handed beta-twist requires shear numbers slightly larger than the number of strands. Membrane protein beta-barrels contain between 8 and 22 beta-strands and have a simple topology that is probably enforced by the folding process. The smallest barrels form inverse micelles and work as enzymes or they bind to other macromolecules. The medium-range barrels form more or less specific pores for nutrient uptake, whereas the largest barrels occur in active Fe(2+) transporters. The beta-barrels are suitable objects for channel engineering, because the structures are simple and because many of these proteins can be produced into inclusion bodies and recovered therefrom in the exact native conformation.},

In these experiments, one to several hundred particles are driven through the orifice of the nanopore. Following the initial translocation, the pressure is reversed and the particles are driven through the GNM orifice in the reverse direction. The resistive-pulse technique is used to monitor the temporal sequence of particle capture and release translocations. The size of the particles (120-160 nm) and the direction of translocation can be determined from the pulse amplitude and shape. The stochastic influence of diffusion on particle trajectories has been investigated, including instantaneous transfer rate, release probability, and cumulative release success rate. We demonstrate that the sequence of particle translocations in the capture step (a, b, c... where the letters represent different particles) is largely preserved and can be read out by resistive-pulse signature during the release translocations (...c, b, a). The observed stochastic events are in good agreement with a convective diffusion model of particle trajectory within the confined geometry of the nanopore. The pressure-reversal technique opens new avenues for chemical analysis of particles using resistive-pulse methods.},

Using pH-tuned single-molecule electrophysiology and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate how peptide passage through the $\alpha$-hemolysin protein can be sufficiently slowed down to observe intermediate single-peptide sub-states associated to distinct structural milestones along the pore, and how to control residence time, direction and the sequence of spatio-temporal state-to-state dynamics of a single peptide. Molecular dynamics simulations of peptide translocation reveal the time- dependent ordering of intermediate structures of the translocating peptide inside the pore at atomic resolution. Calculations of the expected current ratios of the different pore-blocking microstates and their time sequencing are in accord with the recorded current traces.},

abstract = {The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria consists of two distinct membranes, the inner (IM) and the outer membrane (OM) separated by the periplasm. The OM contains in the outer leaflet the lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a complex lipid with important biological activities. In the host it elicits the innate immune response whereas in the bacterium it is responsible for the peculiar permeability barrier properties exhibited by the OM. The chemical structure of LPS and its biosynthetic pathways have been fully elucidated. By contrast only recently details of the transport and assembly of LPS into the OM have emerged. LPS is synthesized in the cytoplasm and at the inner leaflet of the IM and needs to cross two different compartments, the IM and the periplasm, to reach its final destination at the OM. This review focuses on recent studies that led to our present understanding of the protein machine implicated in LPS transport and in assembly at the cell surface. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The hypothesis that mismatch between transmembrane (TM) length and bilayer width controls TM protein affinity for ordered lipid domains (rafts) was tested using perfringolysin O (PFO), a pore-forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysin. PFO forms a multimeric barrel with many TM segments. The properties of PFO mutants with lengthened or shortened TM segments were compared with that of PFO with wild type TM sequences. Both mutant and wild type length PFO exhibited cholesterol-dependent membrane insertion. Maximal PFO-induced pore formation occurred in vesicles with wider bilayers for lengthened TM segments and in thinner bilayers for shortened TM segments. In diC(18:0) phosphatidylcholine (PC)/diC(14:1) PC/cholesterol vesicles, which form ordered domains with a relatively thick bilayer and disordered domains with a relatively thin bilayer, affinity for ordered domains was greatest with lengthened TM segments and least with shortened TM segments as judged by FRET. Similar results were observed by microscopy in giant vesicles containing sphingomyelin in place of diC(18:0) PC. In contrast, in diC(16:0) PC/diC(14:0) PC/diC(20:1) PC/cholesterol vesicles, which should form ordered domains with a relatively thin bilayer and disordered domains with a relatively thick bilayer, relative affinity for ordered domains was greatest with shortened TM segments and least with lengthened TM segments. The inability of multi-TM segment proteins (unlike single TM segment proteins) to adapt to mismatch by tilting may explain the sensitivity of raft affinity to mismatch. The difference in width sensitivity for single and multi-TM helix proteins may link raft affinity to multimeric state and thus control the assembly of multimeric TM complexes in rafts.},

abstract = {Transmembrane beta-barrels, first observed in bacterial porins, are possible models for a number of membrane channels. Restrained molecular dynamics simulations based on idealized C alpha beta templates have been used to generate models of such beta-barrels. Model beta-barrels have been analyzed in terms of their conformational, energetic, and pore properties. Model beta-barrels formed by N = 4, 8, 12 and 16 anti-parallel Ala10 strands have been developed. For each N, beta-barrels with shear numbers S = N to 2N have been modeled. In all beta-barrel models the constituent beta-strands adopt a pronounced right-handed twist. Interstrand interactions are of approximately equal stability for all models with N > or = 8, whereas such interactions are weaker for the N = 4 beta-barrels. In N = 4 beta-barrels the pore is too narrow (minimum radius approximately 0.6 A) to allow ion permeation. For N > or = 8, the pore radius depends on both N and S; for a given value of N an increase in S from N to 2N is predicted to result in an approximately threefold increase in pore conductance. Calculated maximal conductances for the beta-barrel models are compared with experimental values for porins and for K+ channels.},

abstract = {We have conducted molecular dynamics simulations of water flow in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for (6,6) to (20,20) CNTs at a streaming velocity of 100 ms. The fluidized piston model (FPM) and the ice piston model (IPM) are employed to drive flow through the CNTs. The results show that the single-file water flow inside (6,6) CNT has a convex upward streaming velocity profile, whereas the velocity profiles in (10,10) to (20,20) CNTs are flat except near the tube wall. The flow structure of cylindrical water in the (8,8) CNT is intermediate between that for the (6,6) CNT and the larger CNTs. The flow parameters are found not to exhibit any dependence on streaming velocity at up to 300 ms in the (12,12) CNT. The hydrogen bond lifetimes of water flowing in CNTs tend to be longer than for the corresponding equilibrium states, and nonzero flow does not reduce the microscopic structure or structural robustness (hydrogen bond lifetime). Although the atomic density profile varies with tube diameter, reflecting the change in static microscopic structure of flow from single file to cylindrical, tube diameter does not induce a clear transition in streaming velocity, temperature, or hydrogen bond lifetime over this diameter range. The results suggest that water flow in CNTs of this size is more pluglike than Poiseuille type, although the flow structure does not strictly accord with either definition.},

abstract = {The outer membrane protein G (OmpG) is a monomeric 33 kDa 14-stranded $\beta$-barrel membrane protein functioning as a nonspecific porin for the uptake of oligosaccharides in Escherichia coli. Two different crystal structures of OmpG obtained at different values of pH suggest a pH-gated pore opening mechanism. In these structures, extracellular loop 6 extends away from the barrel wall at neutral pH but is folded back into the pore lumen at low pH, blocking transport through the pore. Loop 6 was invisible in a previously published solution NMR structure of OmpG in n-dodecylphosphocholine micelles, presumably due to conformational exchange on an intermediate NMR time scale. Here we present an NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE)-based approach to visualize the conformational dynamics of loop 6 and to calculate conformational ensembles that explain the pH-gated opening and closing of the OmpG channel. The different loop conformers detected by the PRE ensemble calculations were validated by disulfide cross-linking of strategically engineered cysteines and electrophysiological single channel recordings. The results indicate a more dynamically regulated channel opening and closing than previously thought and reveal additional membrane-associated conformational ensembles at pH 6.3 and 7.0. We anticipate this approach to be generally applicable to detect and characterize functionally important conformational ensembles of membrane proteins.},

abstract = {(Received: 16 January 2009; accepted: 14 May 2009; published online: 5 June 2009) \nThe electrostatic properties of lipid membranes are of profound importance as they are directly associated with membrane potential and, consequently, with numerous membrane-mediated biological phenomena. Here we address a number of methodological issues related to the computation of the electrostatic potential from atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayers. We discuss two slightly different forms of Poisson equation that are normally used to calculate the membrane potential: (i) a classical form when the potential and the electric field are chosen to be zero on one of the sides of a simulation box and (ii) an alternative form, when the potential is set to be the same on the opposite sides of a simulation box. Both forms differ by a position-dependent correction term, which has been shown to be proportional to the overall dipole moment of a bilayer system (for neutral systems). For symmetric bilayers we demonstrate that both approaches give essentially the same potential profiles, provided that simulations are long enough (a production run of at least 100 ns is required) and that fluctuations of the center of mass of a bilayer are properly accounted for. In contrast, for asymmetric lipid bilayers, the second approach is no longer appropriate due to a nonzero net dipole moment across a simulation box with a single asymmetric bilayer. We demonstrate that in this case the electrostatic potential can adequately be described by the classical form of Poisson equation, provided that it is employed in conjunction with tin-foil boundary conditions, which exactly balance a nonzero surface charge of a periodically replicated multibilayer system. Furthermore, we show that vacuum boundary conditions give qualitatively similar potential profiles for asymmetric lipid bilayers as compared to the conventional periodic boundaries, but accurate determination of the transmembrane potential difference is then hindered due to detachment of some water dipoles from bulk aqueous solution to vacuum.},

Four ion-binding sites cluster at the center of the protein: one specific for Ca2+ and three that likely bind Na+.

In this technique, single-stranded DNA electrophoretically moves through the nanopore and results in an ionic current that is nucleotide-specific. However, with a high transport velocity of the DNA within the nanopore, the ionic current cannot be used to distinguish signals within noise. Through extensive ($\sim$100 $\mu$s in total) all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we examine the effect of positively charged residues on DNA translocation rate and the ionic current blockades in MspA.

abstract = {Cys-loop receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) that mediate fast synaptic transmission. Here functional pentameric assembly of truncated fragments comprising the ligand-binding N-terminal ectodomains and the first three transmembrane helices, M1-M3, of both the inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha1 and the 5HT(3)A receptor subunits was found to be rescued by coexpressing the complementary fourth transmembrane helix, M4. Alanine scanning identified multiple aromatic residues in M1, M3 and M4 as key determinants of GlyR assembly. Homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that these residues define an interhelical aromatic network, which we propose determines the geometry of M1-M4 tetrahelical packing such that nascent pLGIC subunits must adopt a closed fivefold symmetry. Because pLGIC ectodomains form random nonstoichiometric oligomers, proper pentameric assembly apparently depends on intersubunit interactions between extracellular domains and intrasubunit interactions between transmembrane segments.},

Here we describe the design and generation of a stable DNA-based nanopore that structurally mimics the amphiphilic nature of protein pores and inserts into bilayers to support a steady transmembrane flow of ions. The pore carries an outer hydrophobic belt comprised of small chemical alkyl groups which mask the negatively charged oligonucleotide backbone. This modification overcomes the otherwise inherent energetic mismatch to the hydrophobic environment of the membrane. By merging the fields of nanopores and DNA nanotechnology, we expect that the small membrane-spanning DNA pore will help open up the design of entirely new molecular devices for a broad range of applications including sensing, electric circuits, catalysis, and research into nanofluidics and controlled transmembrane transport.},

abstract = {We investigated the convergence behavior of potential of mean force (PMF) calculations using free energy perturbation (FEP), thermodynamic integration (TI), and “slow growth” (SG) techniques. The critical comparison of these alternative approaches is illustrated by the study of three different systems: two tagged argon atoms in a periodic box of argon, two methane molecules, and two benzene molecules maintained in a “T-shaped” conformation, both dimers embedded in a periodic box of water. The complete PMF simulations were carried out considering several protocols, in which the number of intermediate “$\lambda$” states, together with the amount of sampling per individual state, were varied. In most cases, as much as 1 ns of molecular dynamics (MD) sampling was used to derive each free energy profile. For the different systems examined, we find that FEP and TI unquestionably constitute robust computational methods leading to results of comparable accuracy. We also show that proper convergence of the free energy calculations, and further quantitative interpretation of the PMFs, requires total simulation times much higher than has been hitherto estimated. In some circumstances, the free energy profiles derived from FEP calculations tend to be slightly poorer than those obtained with TI, as a probable consequence of the greater sensitivity of FEP to the window spacing $\delta$$\lambda$. In the context of TI, and to a lesser extent FEP, simulations, it appears preferable to employ a limited number of “$\lambda$” points of the integrand involving extensive sampling, rather than numerous points with fewer samplings. Finally, we note that, at least in the case of nonpolar interactions, PMFs of reasonable quality can be generated using SG, and at a substantially lower cost than with either FEP or TI. © 1996 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

In this research, probe oligonucleotide-grafted particles are used to detect target DNA in solution through a resistive pulse nanopore detection technique. Using carbodiimide chemistry, functionalised probe DNA strands are attached to carboxylated dextran-based magnetic particles. Subsequent incubation with complementary target DNA yields a change in surface properties as the two DNA strands hybridize. Particle-by-particle analysis with resistive pulse sensing is performed to detect these changes. A variable pressure method allows identification of changes in the surface charge of particles. As proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that target hybridization is selectively detected at micromolar concentrations (nanomoles of target) using resistive pulse sensing, confirmed by fluorescence and phase analysis light scattering as complementary techniques. The advantages, feasibility and limitations of using resistive pulse sensing for sample analysis are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The resistance is many orders of magnitude higher than for electrolyte-filled membranes and does not depend on the electrolyte concentration or pH, but it does depend on the type of hydrophobic monolayer and its density. The corresponding surface resistance varies from greater than 10(18) Omega per square to less than 3 x 10(9) Omega per square. When the hydrophobic monolayer contains a small proportion of photoactive spiropyran that is insufficient to switch the surface to hydrophilic after spiropyran photoisomerization to the merocyanine form, the membrane resistance also becomes light-dependent with a reversible increase of surface resistance by as much as 15%. Surface conduction is ascribed to hydration and ionization of the alumina surface hydroxyls and the ionizable groups of the hydrophobic surface modifiers.},

Here we show how the K+ channel displaces water molecules around an ion at its extracellular entryway, and how it holds a K+ ion in a square antiprism of water molecules in a cavity near its intracellular entryway. Carbonyl oxygen atoms within the selectivity filter form a very similar square antiprism around each K+ binding site, as if to mimic the waters of hydration. The selectivity filter changes its ion coordination structure in low K+ solutions. This structural change is crucial to the operation of the selectivity filter in the cellular context, where the K+ ion concentration near the selectivity filter varies in response to channel gating.},

abstract = {Secondary active transporters couple the free energy of the electrochemical potential of one solute to the transmembrane movement of another. As a basic mechanistic explanation for their transport function the model of alternating access was put forward more than 40 years ago, and has been supported by numerous kinetic, biochemical and biophysical studies. According to this model, the transporter exposes its substrate binding site(s) to one side of the membrane or the other during transport catalysis, requiring a substantial conformational change of the carrier protein. In the light of recent structural data for a number of secondary transport proteins, we analyze the model of alternating access in more detail, and correlate it with specific structural and chemical properties of the transporters, such as their assignment to different functional states in the catalytic cycle of the respective transporter, the definition of substrate binding sites, the type of movement of the central part of the carrier harboring the substrate binding site, as well as the impact of symmetry on fold-specific conformational changes. Besides mediating the transmembrane movement of solutes, the mechanism of secondary carriers inherently involves a mechanistic coupling of substrate flux to the electrochemical potential of co-substrate ions or solutes. Mainly because of limitations in resolution of available transporter structures, this important aspect of secondary transport cannot yet be substantiated by structural data to the same extent as the conformational change aspect. We summarize the concepts of coupling in secondary transport and discuss them in the context of the available evidence for ion binding to specific sites and the impact of the ions on the conformational state of the carrier protein, which together lead to mechanistic models for coupling.},

abstract = {A detailed picture of water and ion properties in small pores is important for understanding the behavior of biological ion channels. Several recent modeling studies have shown that small, hydrophobic pores exclude water and ions even if they are physically large enough to accommodate them, a mechanism called hydrophobic gating. This mechanism has been implicated in the gating of several channels, including the mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS). Although the pore in the crystal structure of MscS is wide and was initially hypothesized to be open, it is lined by hydrophobic residues and may represent a nonconducting state. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on MscS to determine whether or not the structure can conduct ions. Unlike previous simulations of hydrophobic nanopores, electric fields were applied to this system to model the transmembrane potential, which proved to be important. Although simulations without a potential resulted in a dehydrated, occluded pore, the application of a potential increased the hydration of the pore and resulted in current flow through the channel. The calculated channel conductance was in good agreement with experiment. Therefore, it is likely that the MscS crystal structure is closer to a conducting than a nonconducting state.},

abstract = {Molecular scale signal conversion and multiplication is of particular importance in many physical and biological applications, such as molecular switches, nano-gates, biosensors, and various neural systems. Unfortunately, little is currently known regarding the signal processing at the molecular level, partly due to the significant noises arising from the thermal fluctuations and interferences between branch signals. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to show that a signal at the single-electron level can be converted and multiplied into 2 or more signals by water chains confined in a narrow Y-shaped nanochannel. This remarkable transduction capability of molecular signal by Y-shaped nanochannel is found to be attributable to the surprisingly strong dipole-induced ordering of such water chains, such that the concerted water orientations in the 2 branches of the Y-shaped nanotubes can be modulated by the water orientation in the main channel. The response to the switching of the charge signal is very rapid, from a few nanoseconds to a few hundred nanoseconds. Furthermore, simulations with various water models, including TIP3P, TIP4P, and SPC/E, show that the transduction capability of the Y-shaped carbon nanotubes is very robust at room temperature, with the interference between branch signals negligible.},

Carbon nanotubes simplify the construction of nanopores, permit new types of electrical measurements, and may open avenues for control of DNA translocation.},

abstract = {The ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) is a prokaryotic homolog of the eukaryotic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) that responds to the binding of neurotransmitter acetylcholine and mediates fast signal transmission. ELIC is similar to the nAChR in its primary sequence and overall subunit organization, but despite their structural similarity, it is not clear whether these two ligand-gated ion channels operate in a similar manner. Further, it is not known to what extent mechanistic insights gleaned from the ELIC structure translate to eukaryotic counterparts such as the nAChR. Here we use molecular-dynamics simulations to probe the conformational dynamics and hydration of the transmembrane pore of ELIC. The results are compared with those from our previous simulation of the human ??7 nAChR. Overall, ELIC displays increased stability compared to the nAChR, whereas the two proteins exhibit remarkable similarity in their global motion and flexibility patterns. The majority of the increased stability of ELIC does not stem from the deficiency of the models used in the simulations, and but rather seems to have a structural basis. Slightly altered dynamical correlation features are also observed among several loops within the membrane region. In sharp contrast to the nAChR, ELIC is completely dehydrated from the pore center to the extracellular end throughout the simulation. Finally, the simulation of an ELIC mutant substantiates the important role of F246 on the stability, hydration and possibly function of the ELIC channel. ?? 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {We describe the isolation and characterization of mutations in ompF that alter the pore properties of the OmpF porin. The selection makes use of the fact that maltodextrins larger than maltotriose are too large to diffuse through the normal OmpF pore. By demanding growth on maltodextrins (Dex+) in the absence of the LamB protein, which is normally required for the uptake of these large sugars, we are able to obtain ompF mutations. These include transversions, transitions and small deletions. We obtained almost exclusively ompF mutations in spite of the fact that analogous alterations in ompC can result in similar phenotypes. Fifteen independent point mutations identify residues R42, R82, D113 and R132 of the mature peptide as important in pore function. The alterations result in uncharged amino acids being substituted for charged amino acids. Growth tests, antibiotic sensitivities and rates of [14C]maltose uptake suggest that the alterations result in an increased pore size. Small deletions of six to 15 amino acid residues in the region between A108 and V133 of mature OmpF dramatically alter outer membrane permeability to hydrophobic antibiotics and detergents as well as conferring a Dex+ phenotype. We suggest that these mutations affect both the pore function and interactions with other outer membrane components. A model of OmpF protein structure based on general rules for folding membrane proteins and these mutations is presented.},

These simulations are the first to model this gradient in all-atom detail, with the field generated solely by explicit ion dynamics. Unlike traditional bilayer simulations that have one bilayer per unit cell, we simulate a 170 mV potential gradient by using a unit cell consisting of three salt-water baths separated by two bilayers, with full three-dimensional periodicity. The study shows that current computational resources are powerful enough to generate a truly electrified interface, as we show the predicted effect of the field on the overall charge distribution. Additionally, starting from Poisson's equation, we show a new derivation of the double integral equation for calculating the potential profile in systems with this type of periodicity.},

abstract = {The hydration structures of the hydrophobic solutes benzene and cyclohexane were investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a single solute in water. Detailed, spatially resolved, three-dimensional maps of the density of the water O and H atoms surrounding either benzene or cyclohexane were generated from the simulation data. MD simulations were computed for each solute using either the ENCAD or GROMACS program package and one of five distinct water models:? F3C, TIP3P, TIP4P, SPC, or SPC/E. For each solute, five 100 ns data sets, each representing a unique simulation condition, were analyzed. The water structure maps generated from the five data sets for each solute are remarkably similar. Our results show that water molecules in the first hydration shell around cyclohexane bind weakly. In contrast, water molecules bind more strongly and in a hydrogen-bonding orientation to the faces of the benzene ring. The high-resolution maps of the water structure surrounding benzene and cyclohexane presented in this paper reveal details of the positional preferences of water not resolved by other methods. They also show that the hydration structure at this level of detail is remarkably insensitive to the potential energy functions and simulation methods used.},

abstract = {Graphene nanopore is a promising device for single molecule sensing, including DNA bases, as its single atom thickness provides high spatial resolution. To attain high sensitivity, the size of the molecule should be comparable to the pore diameter. However, when the pore diameter approaches the size of the molecule, ion properties and dynamics may deviate from the bulk values and continuum analysis may not be accurate. In this paper, we investigate the static and dynamic properties of ions with and without an external voltage drop in sub-5-nm graphene nanopores using molecular dynamics simulations. Ion concentration in graphene nanopores sharply drops from the bulk concentration when the pore radius is smaller than 0.9 nm. Ion mobility in the pore is also smaller than bulk ion mobility due to the layered liquid structure in the pore-axial direction. Our results show that a continuum analysis can be appropriate when the pore radius is larger than 0.9 nm if pore conductivity is properly defined. Since many applications of graphene nanopores, such as DNA and protein sensing, involve ion transport, the results presented here will be useful not only in understanding the behavior of ion transport but also in designing bio-molecular sensors.},

The BAM complex consists of five proteins: one membrane protein, BamA, and four lipoproteins, BamB, BamC, BamD, and BamE. Here, we report the first crystal structure of a Bam lipoprotein complex: the essential lipoprotein BamD in complex with the N-terminal half of BamC (BamC(UN) (Asp(28)-Ala(217)), a 73-residue-long unstructured region followed by the N-terminal domain). The BamCD complex is stabilized predominantly by various hydrogen bonds and salt bridges formed between BamD and the N-terminal unstructured region of BamC. Sequence and molecular surface analyses revealed that many of the conserved residues in both proteins are found at the BamC-BamD interface. A series of truncation mutagenesis and analytical gel filtration chromatography experiments confirmed that the unstructured region of BamC is essential for stabilizing the BamCD complex structure. The unstructured N terminus of BamC interacts with the proposed substrate-binding pocket of BamD, suggesting that this region of BamC may play a regulatory role in outer membrane protein biogenesis.},

abstract = {The selective rate of specific ion transport across nanoporous material is critical to biological and nanofluidic systems. Molecular sieves for ions can be achieved by steric and electrical effects. However, the radii of Na(+) and K(+) are quite similar; they both carry a positive charge, making them difficult to separate. Biological ionic channels contain precisely arranged arrays of amino acids that can efficiently recognize and guide the passage of K(+) or Na(+) across the cell membrane. However, the design of inorganic channels with novel recognition mechanisms that control the ionic selectivity remains a challenge. We present here a design for a controllable ion-selective nanopore (molecular sieve) based on a single-walled carbon nanotube with specially arranged carbonyl oxygen atoms modified inside the nanopore, which was inspired by the structure of potassium channels in membrane spanning proteins (e.g., KcsA). Our molecular dynamics simulations show that the remarkable selectivity is attributed to the hydration structure of Na(+) or K(+) confined in the nanochannels, which can be precisely tuned by different patterns of the carbonyl oxygen atoms. The results also suggest that a confined environment plays a dominant role in the selectivity process. These studies provide a better understanding of the mechanism of ionic selectivity in the KcsA channel and possible technical applications in nanotechnology and biotechnology, including serving as a laboratory-in-nanotube for special chemical interactions and as a high-efficiency nanodevice for purification or desalination of sea and brackish water.},

However, full-length OmpA resists crystallographic efforts, and the link between its function and tertiary structure remains controversial. Here we use site-directed mutagenesis and mass spectrometry of different constructs of OmpA, released in the gas phase from detergent micelles, to define the minimal region encompassing the C-terminal dimer interface. Combining knowledge of the location of the dimeric interface with molecular modeling and ion mobility data allows us to propose a low-resolution model for the full-length OmpA dimer. Our model of the dimer is in remarkable agreement with experimental ion mobility data, with none of the unfolding or collapse observed for full-length monomeric OmpA, implying that dimer formation stabilizes the overall structure and prevents collapse of the flexible linker that connects the two domains. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin occurs naturally as two-dimensional crystals. A three-dimensional density map of the structure, at near-atomic resolution, has been obtained by studying the crystals using electron cryo-microscopy to obtain electron diffraction patterns and high-resolution micrographs. New methods were developed for analysing micrographs from tilted specimens, incorporating methods previously developed for untilted specimens that enable large areas to be analysed and corrected for distortions. Data from 72 images, from both tilted and untilted specimens, were analysed to produce the phases of 2700 independent Fourier components of the structure. The amplitudes of these components were accurately measured from 150 diffraction patterns. Together, these data represent about half of the full three-dimensional transform to 3.5 A. The map of the structure has a resolution of 3.5 A in a direction parallel to the membrane plane but lower than this in the perpendicular direction. It shows many features in the density that are resolved from the main density of the seven alpha-helices. We interpret these features as the bulky aromatic side-chains of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan residues. There is also a very dense feature, which is the beta-ionone ring of the retinal chromophore. Using these bulky side-chains as guide points and taking account of bulges in the helices that indicate smaller side-chains such as leucine, a complete atomic model for bacteriorhodopsin between amino acid residues 8 and 225 has been built. There are 21 amino acid residues, contributed by all seven helices, surrounding the retinal and 26 residues, contributed by five helices, forming the proton pathway or channel. Ten of the amino acid residues in the middle of the proton channel are also part of the retinal binding site. The model also provides a useful basis for consideration of the mechanism of proton pumping and allows a consistent interpretation of a great deal of other experimental data. In particular, the structure suggests that pK changes in the Schiff base must act as the means by which light energy is converted into proton pumping pressure in the channel. Asp96 is on the pathway from the cytoplasm to the Schiff base and Asp85 is on the pathway from the Schiff base to the extracellular surface.},

abstract = {The effects of the channel-forming peptide gramicidin D (gD) on the conductance and electroporation thresholds of planar bilayer lipid membranes, made of the synthetic lipid 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), was studied. High-amplitude ( approximately 200-900 mV) rectangular voltage pulses of 15 ms duration were used to perturb the bilayers and monitor the transmembrane conductance. Electroporation voltage thresholds were found, and conductance was recorded before and after electroporation. Gramicidin was added to the system in peptide/lipid ratios of 1:10, 000, 1:500, and 1:15. The addition of gD in a ratio of 1:10,000 had no effect on electroporation, but ratios of 1:500 and 1:15 significantly increased the thresholds by 16% (p < 0.0001) and 40% (p < 0.0001), respectively. Membrane conductance before electroporation was measurable only after the addition of gD and increased monotonically as the peptide/lipid ratio increased. The effect of gD on the membrane area expansivity modulus (K) was tested using giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). When gD was incorporated into the vesicles in a 1:15 ratio, K increased by 110%, consistent with the increase in thresholds predicted by an electromechanical model. These findings suggest that the presence of membrane proteins may affect the electroporation of lipid bilayers by changing their mechanical properties.},

In the intervening years, however, new information has documented the importance and roles of specialized membrane domains, such as lipid rafts and protein/glycoprotein complexes, in describing the macrostructure, dynamics and functions of cellular membranes as well as the roles of membrane-associated cytoskeletal fences and extracellular matrix structures in limiting the lateral diffusion and range of motion of membrane components. These newer data build on the foundation of the original model and add new layers of complexity and hierarchy, but the concepts described in the original model are still applicable today. In updated versions of the model more emphasis has been placed on the mosaic nature of the macrostructure of cellular membranes where many protein and lipid components are limited in their rotational and lateral motilities in the membrane plane, especially in their natural states where lipid-lipid, protein-protein and lipid-protein interactions as well as cell-matrix, cell-cell and intracellular membrane-associated protein and cytoskeletal interactions are important in restraining the lateral motility and range of motion of particular membrane components. The formation of specialized membrane domains and the presence of tightly packed integral membrane protein complexes due to membrane-associated fences, fenceposts and other structures are considered very important in describing membrane dynamics and architecture. These structures along with membrane-associated cytoskeletal and extracellular structures maintain the long-range, non-random mosaic macro-organization of membranes, while smaller membrane nano- and submicro-sized domains, such as lipid rafts and protein complexes, are important in maintaining specialized membrane structures that are in cooperative dynamic flux in a crowded membrane plane.

abstract = {Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) typically consist of a hydrophobic domain known as lipid A (or endotoxin), a nonrepeating "core" oligosaccharide, and a distal polysaccharide (or O-antigen). Recent genomic data have facilitated study of LPS assembly in diverse Gram-negative bacteria, many of which are human or plant pathogens, and have established the importance of lateral gene transfer in generating structural diversity of O-antigens. Many enzymes of lipid A biosynthesis like LpxC have been validated as targets for development of new antibiotics. Key genes for lipid A biosynthesis have unexpectedly also been found in higher plants, indicating that eukaryotic lipid A-like molecules may exist. Most significant has been the identification of the plasma membrane protein TLR4 as the lipid A signaling receptor of animal cells. TLR4 belongs to a family of innate immunity receptors that possess a large extracellular domain of leucine-rich repeats, a single trans-membrane segment, and a smaller cytoplasmic signaling region that engages the adaptor protein MyD88. The expanding knowledge of TLR4 specificity and its downstream signaling pathways should provide new opportunities for blocking inflammation associated with infection.},

abstract = {Sensitivity and specificity are two most important factors to take into account for molecule sensing, chemical detection and disease diagnosis. A perfect sensitivity is to reach the level where a single molecule can be detected. An ideal specificity is to reach the level where the substance can be detected in the presence of many contaminants. The rapidly progressing nanopore technology is approaching this threshold. A wide assortment of biomotors and cellular pores in living organisms perform diverse biological functions. The elegant design of these transportation machineries has inspired the development of single molecule detection based on modulations of the individual current blockage events. The dynamic growth of nanotechnology and nanobiotechnology has stimulated rapid advances in the study of nanopore based instrumentation over the last decade, and inspired great interest in sensing of single molecules including ions, nucleotides, enantiomers, drugs, and polymers such as PEG, RNA, DNA, and polypeptides. This sensing technology has been extended to medical diagnostics and third generation high throughput DNA sequencing. This review covers current nanopore detection platforms including both biological pores and solid state counterparts. Several biological nanopores have been studied over the years, but this review will focus on the three best characterized systems including $\alpha$-hemolysin and MspA, both containing a smaller channel for the detection of single-strand DNA, as well as bacteriophage phi29 DNA packaging motor connector that contains a larger channel for the passing of double stranded DNA. The advantage and disadvantage of each system are compared; their current and potential applications in nanomedicine, biotechnology, and nanotechnology are discussed.},

It is classified as a class frizzled (class F) G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), although the canonical hedgehog signalling pathway involves the GLI transcription factors and the sequence similarity with class A GPCRs is less than 10%. Here we report the crystal structure of the transmembrane domain of the human SMO receptor bound to the small-molecule antagonist LY2940680 at 2.5 \AA resolution. Although the SMO receptor shares the seven-transmembrane helical fold, most of the conserved motifs for class A GPCRs are absent, and the structure reveals an unusually complex arrangement of long extracellular loops stabilized by four disulphide bonds. The ligand binds at the extracellular end of the seven-transmembrane-helix bundle and forms extensive contacts with the loops.},

We predict transmembrane and peripherally associated regions from genomic sequence and position peptides and protein structures relative to the bilayer (available at http://www.degradolab.org/ez). The pseudo-energy topological landscapes underscore positional stability and functional mechanisms demonstrated here for antimicrobial peptides, transmembrane proteins, and viral fusion proteins. Moreover, experimental effects of point mutations on the relative ratio changes of dual-topology proteins are quantitatively reproduced. The functional group potential and the membrane-exposed residues display the largest energetic changes enabling to detect native-like structures from decoys. Hence, focusing on the uniqueness of membrane-associated proteins and peptides, we quantitatively parameterize their cross-membrane propensity, thus facilitating structural refinement, characterization, prediction, and design.},

To gain insight into the function of these proteins A we have determined the crystal structure of E. coli OmpW to 2.7-A resolution. The structure shows that OmpW forms an 8-stranded beta-barrel with a long and narrow hydrophobic channel that contains a bound n-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylamine-N-oxide detergent molecule. Single channel conductance experiments show that OmpW functions as an ion channel in planar lipid bilayers. The channel activity can be blocked by the addition of n-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylamine-N-oxide. Taken together, the data suggest that members of the OmpW family could be involved in the transport of small hydrophobic molecules across the bacterial outer membrane.},

abstract = {Phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) regulates the function of ion channels and transporters. Here, we demonstrate that PIP2 directly binds the human dopamine (DA) transporter (hDAT), a key regulator of DA homeostasis and a target of the psychostimulant amphetamine (AMPH). This binding occurs through electrostatic interactions with positively charged hDAT N-terminal residues and is shown to facilitate AMPH-induced, DAT-mediated DA efflux and the psychomotor properties of AMPH. Substitution of these residues with uncharged amino acids reduces hDAT-PIP2 interactions and AMPH-induced DA efflux without altering the hDAT physiological function of DA uptake. We evaluated the significance of this interaction in vivo using locomotion as a behavioral assay in Drosophila melanogaster. Expression of mutated hDAT with reduced PIP2 interaction in Drosophila DA neurons impairs AMPH-induced locomotion without altering basal locomotion. We present what is to our knowledge the first demonstration of how PIP2 interactions with a membrane protein can regulate the behaviors of complex organisms.},

@article{Killian1996,
abstract = {We have investigated the effect of several hydrophobic polypeptides on the phase behavior of diacylphosphatidylcholines with different acyl chain length. The polypeptides are uncharged and consist of a sequence with variable length of alternating leucine and alanine, flanked on both sides by two tryptophans, and with the N- and C-termini blocked. First it was demonstrated by circular dichroism measurements that these peptides adopt an alpha-helical conformation with a transmembrane orientation in bilayers of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. Subsequent 31P NMR measurements showed that the peptides can affect lipid organization depending on the difference in hydrophobic length between the peptide and the lipid bilayer in the liquid-crystalline phase. When a 17 amino acid residue long peptide (WALP17) was incorporated in a 1/10 molar ratio of peptide to lipid, a bilayer was maintained in saturated phospholipids containing acyl chains of 12 and 14 C atoms, an isotropic phase was formed at 16 C atoms, and an inverted hexagonal (HII) phase at 18 and 20 C atoms. For a 19 amino acid residue long peptide (WALP19) similar changes in lipid phase behavior were observed, but at acyl chain lengths of 2 C-atoms longer. Also in several cis-unsaturated phosphatidylcholine model membranes it was found that these peptides and a shorter analog (WALP16) induce the formation of nonbilayer structures as a consequence of hydrophobic mismatch. It is proposed that this unique ability of the peptides to induce nonbilayer structures in phosphatidylcholine model membranes is due to the presence of two tryptophans at both sides of the membrane/water interface, which prevent the peptide from aggregating when the mismatch is increased. Comparison of the hydrophobic length of the bilayers with the length of the different peptides showed that it is the precise extent of mismatch that determines whether the preferred lipid organization is a bilayer, isotropic phase, or HII phase. The peptide-containing bilayer and HII phase were further characterized after sucrose density gradient centrifugation of mixtures of WALP16 and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine. 31P NMR measurements of the isolated fractions showed that a complete separation of both components was obtained. Chemical analysis of these fractions in samples with varying peptide concentration indicated that the HII phase is highly enriched in peptide (peptide/lipid molar ratio of 1/6), while the maximum solubility of the peptide in the lipid bilayer is about 1/24 (peptide/lipid, molar). A molecular model of the peptide-induced HII phase is presented that is consistent with the results obtained thus far.},

abstract = {The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) mediates rapid excitatory responses through ligand-gated channels (5-HT3 receptors). Recombinant expression of the only identified receptor subunit (5-HT3A) yields functional 5-HT3 receptors. However, the conductance of these homomeric receptors (sub-picosiemens) is too small to be resolved directly, and contrasts with a robust channel conductance displayed by neuronal 5-HT3 receptors (9-17 pS). Neuronal 5-HT3 receptors also display a permeability to calcium ions and a current-voltage relationship that differ from those of homomeric receptors. Here we describe a new class of 5-HT3-receptor subunit (5-HT3B). Transcripts of this subunit are co-expressed with the 5-HT3A subunit in the amygdala, caudate and hippocampus. Heteromeric assemblies of 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits display a large single-channel conductance (16 pS), low permeability to calcium ions, and a current-voltage relationship which resembles that of characterized neuronal 5-HT3 channels. The heteromeric receptors also display distinctive pharmacological properties. Surprisingly, the M2 region of the 5-HT3B subunit lacks any of the structural features that are known to promote the conductance of related receptors. In addition to providing a new target for therapeutic agents, the 5-HT3B subunit will be a valuable resource for defining the molecular mechanisms of ion-channel function.},

abstract = {A middle-resolution coarse-grained model of DNA is proposed. The DNA chain is built of spherical and planar rigid bodies connected by elastic virtual bonds. The bonded part of the potential energy function is fit to potentials of mean force of model systems. The rigid bodies are sets of neutral, charged, and dipolar beads. Electrostatic and van der Waals interactions are parametrized by our recently developed procedure [Maciejczyk, M.; Spasic, A.; Liwo, A.; Scheraga, H.A. J. Comp. Chem. 2010, 31, 1644]. Interactions with the solvent and an ionic cloud are approximated by a multipole-multipole Debye-H\"{u}ckel model. A very efficient R-RATTLE algorithm, for integrating the movement of rigid bodies, is implemented. It is the first coarse-grained model, in which both bonded and nonbonded interactions were parametrized ab initio and which folds stable double helices from separated complementary strands, with the final conformation close to the geometry of experimentally determined structures.},

By applying constant or alternating biasing voltages, we found that the dsDNA molecule can be unzipped at the junction of the Y-CNT. Because of the energy barrier (a few kBT per base-pair), the motion of the entire DNA molecule was alternatively in a trapped state or a transiting state. We show that during each transiting state the same number of nucleotides were transported (DNA ratcheting). An analytical theory that is mathematically equivalent to the one for Josephson junctions was then proposed to quantitatively describe the simulation results. The controlled motion of DNA in the Y-CNT is expected to enhance the accuracy of nanopore-based DNA sequencing.},

Energy for active transport is obtained from the proton-motive force of the inner membrane through physical interaction with TonB-ExbB-ExbD, an inner membrane complex. Here we report the crystal structure of an active transport, outer membrane receptor at 2.4 A resolution. Two distinct functional domains are revealed: (i) a 22-stranded beta-barrel that spans the outer membrane and contains large extracellular loops which appear to function in ligand binding; and (ii) a globular N-terminal domain that folds into the barrel pore, inhibiting access to the periplasm and contributing two additional loops for potential ligand binding. These loops could provide a signaling pathway between the processes of ligand recognition and TonB-mediated transport. The blockage of the pore suggests that the N-terminal domain must undergo a conformational rearrangement to allow ligand transport into the periplasm.},

Here I report the preparation of a new type of finite carbon structure consisting of needle-like tubes. Produced using an arc-discharge evaporation method similar to that used for fullerene synthesis, the needles grow at the negative end of the electrode used for the arc discharge. Electron microscopy reveals that each needle comprises coaxial tubes of graphitic sheets, ranging in number from 2 up to about 50. On each tube the carbon-atom hexagons are arranged in a helical fashion about the needle axis. The helical pitch varies from needle to needle and from tube to tube within a single needle. It appears that this helical structure may aid the growth process. The formation of these needles, ranging from a few to a few tens of nanometres in diameter, suggests that engineering of carbon structures should be possible on scales considerably greater than those relevant to the fullerenes.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic membrane proteins generally reside in membrane bilayers that have lipid asymmetry. However, in vitro studies of the impact of lipids upon membrane proteins are generally carried out in model membrane vesicles that lack lipid asymmetry. Our recently developed method to prepare lipid vesicles with asymmetry similar to that in plasma membranes and with controlled amounts of cholesterol was used to investigate the influence of lipid composition and lipid asymmetry upon the conformational behavior of the pore-forming, cholesterol-dependent cytolysin perfringolysin O (PFO). PFO conformational behavior in asymmetric vesicles was found to be distinct both from that in symmetric vesicles with the same lipid composition as the asymmetric vesicles and from that in vesicles containing either only the inner leaflet lipids from the asymmetric vesicles or only the outer leaflet lipids from the asymmetric vesicles. The presence of phosphatidylcholine in the outer leaflet increased the cholesterol concentration required to induce PFO binding, whereas phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine in the inner leaflet of asymmetric vesicles stabilized the formation of a novel deeply inserted conformation that does not form pores, even though it contains transmembrane segments. This conformation may represent an important intermediate stage in PFO pore formation. These studies show that lipid asymmetry can strongly influence the behavior of membrane-inserted proteins.},

Urea uptake is greatly enhanced and regulated by HpUreI, a proton-gated inner membrane channel protein essential for gastric survival of H. pylori. The crystal structure of HpUreI describes a static snapshot of the channel with two constriction sites near the center of the bilayer that are too narrow to allow passage of urea or even water. Here we describe the urea transport mechanism at atomic resolution, revealed by unrestrained microsecond equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of the hexameric channel assembly. Two consecutive constrictions open to allow conduction of urea, which is guided through the channel by interplay between conserved residues that determine proton rejection and solute selectivity. Remarkably, HpUreI conducts water at rates equivalent to aquaporins, which might be essential for efficient transport of urea at small concentration gradients.},

The calculated conductance and ion selectivity are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. In addition, ion density distributions inside the channel reveal possible pathways for different ion species. Based on these observations, a mechanism underlying the anion selectivity is proposed; both ion species are transported across the channel, but the rate for K(+) is smaller than that for Cl(-) because of the attractive interactions between K(+) and residues on the channel wall. This difference leads to the anion selectivity of VDAC.},

Biophysical experiments have shown that lipid unsaturation and cholesterol both have significant effects on rhodopsin's stability and function; omega-3 polyunsaturated chains, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), destabilize rhodopsin and enhance the kinetics of the photocycle, whereas cholesterol has the opposite effect. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the possibility that polyunsaturated chains modulate rhodopsin stability and kinetics via specific direct interactions. By analyzing the results of 26 independent 100-ns simulations of dark-adapted rhodopsin, we found that DHA routinely forms tight associations with the protein in a small number of specific locations qualitatively different from the nonspecific interactions made by saturated chains and cholesterol. Furthermore, the presence of tightly packed DHA molecules tends to weaken the interhelical packing. These results are consistent with recent NMR work, which proposes that rhodopsin binds DHA, and they suggest a molecular rationale for DHA's effects on rhodopsin stability and kinetics.},

We have recently reported that HlyA became associated with detergent-resistant membranes enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin; moreover, toxin oligomerization, and hence haemolytic activity, diminishes in cholesterol-depleted erythrocytes. Considering these results, we studied the insertion process, an essential step in the lytic mechanism, by the monolayer technique, finding that HlyA insertion is favoured in cholesterol- and sphingomyelin-containing membranes. On the basis of this result, we studied the direct interaction with either of the lipids by lipid dot blotting, lysis inhibition and SPR (surface plasmon resonance) assays. The results of the present study demonstrated that an interaction between cholesterol and HlyA exists that seems to favour a conformational state of the protein that allows its correct insertion into the membrane and its further oligomerization to form pores.},

abstract = {Monotopic membrane proteins bind tightly to cell membranes but do not generally span the lipid bilayer. Their interactions with lipid bilayers may be studied via coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations. Understanding such interactions is important as monotopic enzymes frequently act on hydrophobic substrates, while X-ray structures rarely provide direct information about their interactions with membranes. CG-MD self-assembly simulations enable prediction of the orientation and depth of insertion into a lipid bilayer of a monotopic protein, and also of the interactions of individual protein residues with lipid molecules. The CG-MD method has been evaluated via comparison with extended (>30 ns) atomistic simulations of monoamine oxidase, revealing good agreement between the results of coarse-grained and atomistic simulations. CG-MD simulations have been applied to a set of 11 monotopic proteins for which three-dimensional structures are available. These proteins may be divided into two groups on the basis of the results of the simulations. One group consists of those proteins which are inserted into the lipid bilayer to a limited extent, interacting mainly at the phospholipid-water interface. The second group consists of those which are inserted more deeply into the bilayer. Those monotopic proteins which are inserted more deeply cause significant local perturbation of bilayer properties such as bilayer thickness. Deeper insertion seems to correlate with a greater number of basic residues in the "foot" whereby a monotopic protein interacts with the membrane.},

As a first step toward dissecting the transition mechanism by accelerated sampling techniques, we study the ligand-induced conformational changes of the acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP), a widely accepted model for the full receptor extracellular domain. Using unbiased Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Temperature Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (TAMD) simulations we investigate the AChBP transition between the apo and the agonist-bound state. In long standard MD simulations, both conformations of the native protein are stable, while the agonist-bound structure evolves toward the apo one if the orientation of few key sidechains in the orthosteric cavity is modified. Conversely, TAMD simulations initiated from the native conformations are able to produce the spontaneous transition. With respect to the modified conformations, TAMD accelerates the transition by at least a factor 10. The analysis of some specific residue-residue interactions points out that the transition mechanism is based on the disruption/formation of few key hydrogen bonds. Finally, while early events of ligand dissociation are observed already in standard MD, TAMD accelerates the ligand detachment and, at the highest TAMD effective temperature, it is able to produce a complete dissociation path in one AChBP subunit.},

abstract = {Electrophoresis is widely used to determine the electrostatic potential of colloidal particles. Oil droplets in pure water show negative or positive electrophoretic mobilities depending on the pH. This is commonly attributed to the adsorption of hydroxyl or hydronium ions, resulting in a negative or positive surface charge, respectively. This explanation, however, is not in agreement with the difference in isoelectric point and point of zero charge observed in experiment. Here we present molecular dynamics simulations of oil droplets in water in the presence of an external electric field but in the absence of any ions. The simulations reproduce the negative sign and the order of magnitude of the oil droplet mobilities at the point of zero charge in experiment. The electrostatic potential in the oil with respect to the water phase, induced by anisotropic dipole orientation in the interface, is positive. Our results suggest that electrophoretic mobility does not always reflect the net charge or electrostatic potential of a suspended liquid droplet and, thus, the interpretation of electrophoresis in terms of purely continuum effects may need to be reevaluated. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Striolo2003,
abstract = {With the use of the grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation, water adsorption isotherms were determined for SPC/E water in slit-shaped graphitic nanopores at 298 K. The pore widths considered were 0.6, 0.625, 0.7, 0.8, 1.0, 1.6, and 2.0 nm. The resulting adsorption isotherms indicated negligible adsorption at low pressures, pore-filling by a capillary-condensation-like mechanism, and adsorption/desorption hysteresis loops. For pore widths equal to or larger than 0.7 nm, the relative pressure at which pore filling occurs and the size of the hysteresis loop decrease with decreasing pore width. For 0.6-nm pores, pore filling occurs at pressures approaching saturation. Upon decreasing the pore width from 2.0 to 0.7 nm, the zero-coverage isosteric heat of adsorption increases from 6 to 14 kJ/mol. The limit at high coverage converges to the enthalpy of condensation for SPC/E water as the pore width increases. From the simulated adsorbed-water densities and distributions across the pores and the use of a mean-field approximation, the solvation force was computed between two flat hydrophobic walls. The force profile oscillates as a function of the wall-to-wall separation. Our results show that attractive peaks of the force correspond to wall-to-wall separations at which confined water molecules cannot establish a finite number of layers, while repulsive peaks correspond to separations at which confined water molecules form well-defined layers of molecules, often stabilized by intralayer hydrogen bonds.},

abstract = {We report the results of extensive molecular dynamics simulations of a simple, but experimentally achievable model of dipolar colloids. It is shown that a modest elongation of the particles and dipoles to make dipolar dumbbells favors branching of the dipolar strings that are routinely observed for point dipolar spheres (e.g., ferrofluids). This branching triggers the formation of a percolating transient network when the effective temperature is lowered along low packing fraction isochores (phi<0.1). Well below the percolation temperature the evolution of various dynamical correlation functions becomes arrested over a rapidly increasing period of time, indicating that a gel has formed. The onset of arrest is closely linked to ongoing structural and topological changes, which we monitor using a variety of diagnostics, including the Euler characteristic. The present system, dominated by long-range interactions between particles, shows similarities to, but also some significant differences from the behavior of previously studied model systems involving short-range attractive interactions between colloids. In particular, we discuss the relation of gel formation to fluid-fluid phase separation and spinodal decomposition in the light of current knowledge of dipolar fluid phase diagrams.},

It is shown that the requirement to exclude solvent from the barrel interior, while at the same time keeping an upper limit on strand twist and interstrand distance so as to foster extensive hydrogen bonding interactions within the sheet, imposes strong constraints on barrel geometry. A formal description of the relationships between beta-sheet twist, strand number, and barrel dimensions is given here.

Their selectivity filter exhibits four binding sites with approximately equal electron density in crystal structures with high K+ concentrations, previously thought to reflect a superposition of alternating ion- and water-occupied states. Consequently, cotranslocation of ions with water has become a widely accepted ion conduction mechanism for potassium channels. By analyzing more than 1300 permeation events from molecular dynamics simulations at physiological voltages, we observed instead that permeation occurs via ion-ion contacts between neighboring K+ ions. Coulomb repulsion between adjacent ions is found to be the key to high-efficiency K+ conduction. Crystallographic data are consistent with directly neighboring K+ ions in the selectivity filter, and our model offers an intuitive explanation for the high throughput rates of K+ channels.},

abstract = {The transport of hydrated ions through narrow pores is important for a number of processes such as the desalination and filtration of water and the conductance of ions through biological channels. Here, molecular dynamics simulations are used to systematically examine the transport of anionic drinking water contaminants (fluoride, chloride, nitrate, and nitrite) through pores ranging in effective radius from 2.8 to 6.5 \AA to elucidate the role of hydration in excluding these species during nanofiltration. Bulk hydration properties (hydrated size and coordination number) are determined for comparison with the situations inside the pores. Free energy profiles for ion transport through the pores show energy barriers depend on pore size, ion type, and membrane surface charge and that the selectivity sequence can change depending on the pore size. Ion coordination numbers along the trajectory showed that partial dehydration of the transported ion is the main contribution to the energy barriers. Ion transport is greatly hindered when the effective pore radius is smaller than the hydrated radius, as the ion has to lose some associated water molecules to enter the pore. Small energy barriers are still observed when pore sizes are larger than the hydrated radius due to re-orientation of the hydration shell or the loss of more distant water. These results demonstrate the importance of ion dehydration in transport through narrow pores, which increases the current level of mechanistic understanding of membrane-based desalination and transport in biological channels.},

abstract = {Antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly gram negative species, present significant health care challenges. The permeation of antibiotics through the outer membrane is largely effected by the porin superfamily, changes in which contribute to antibiotic resistance. A series of antibiotic resistant E. coli isolates were obtained from a patient during serial treatment with various antibiotics. The sequence of OmpC changed at three positions during treatment giving rise to a total of four OmpC variants (denoted OmpC20, OmpC26, OmpC28 and OmpC33, in which OmpC20 was derived from the first clinical isolate). We demonstrate that expression of the OmpC K12 porin in the clinical isolates lowers the MIC, consistent with modified porin function contributing to drug resistance. By a range of assays we have established that the three mutations that occur between OmpC20 and OmpC33 modify transport of both small molecules and antibiotics across the outer membrane. This results in the modulation of resistance to antibiotics, particularly cefotaxime. Small ion unitary conductance measurements of the isolated porins do not show significant differences between isolates. Thus, resistance does not appear to arise from major changes in pore size. Crystal structures of all four OmpC clinical mutants and molecular dynamics simulations also show that the pore size is essentially unchanged. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that perturbation of the transverse electrostatic field at the constriction zone reduces cefotaxime passage through the pore, consistent with laboratory and clinical data. This subtle modification of the transverse electric field is a very different source of resistance than occlusion of the pore or wholesale destruction of the transverse field and points to a new mechanism by which porins may modulate antibiotic passage through the outer membrane.},

abstract = {The Sec complex forms the core of a conserved machinery transporting proteins across or into membranes. In Escherichia coli SecYEG is active as an oligomer, but the structure predicts that the protein-conducting channel is formed by the monomer. A homology model of the E.coli complex was built using the atomic structure of Methanococcus jannaschii SecYEbeta. Another structure of the membrane-bound dimer was then determined by fitting the homology model to an 8A map of SecYEG determined by electron microscopy. We found that the substrate-binding site of the dimer has opened slightly and the plug domain moved toward the outside. This new position retains the channel in a closed state. These differences partially reflect the movements that have been proposed to occur during channel gating. Further opening of the substrate-binding pocket to bind and release bound substrate and displacement of the plug during secretion, presumably rely on the action of the partner proteins. The contacts arising at the dimer interface in the environment of the lipid bilayer may have activated the assembly.},

abstract = {Porins are trimers of beta-barrels that form channels for ions and other hydrophilic solutes in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The X-ray structures of OmpF and PhoE show that each monomeric pore is constricted by an extracellular loop that folds into the channel vestibule, a motif that is highly conserved among bacterial porins. Electrostatic calculations have suggested that the distribution of ionizable groups at the constriction zone (or eyelet) may establish an intrinsic transverse electrostatic field across the pore, that is perpendicular to the pore axis. In order to study the role that electrostatic interactions between pore residues may have in porin function, we used spontaneous mutants and engineered site-directed mutants that have an altered charge distribution at the eyelet and compared their electrophysiological behavior with that of wild-type OmpC. We found that some mutations lead to changes in the spontaneous gating activity of OmpC porin channels. Changes in the concentration of permeant ions also altered this activity. These results suggest that the ionic interactions that exist between charged residues at the constriction zone of porin may play a role in the transitions between the channel's closed and open states.},

abstract = {Inspired by the regulation of cellular activities found in the ion channel proteins, here we developed membrane-embedded synthetic chiral receptors 1 and 2 with different terminal structures, where receptor 1 has hydrophobic triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) groups and receptor 2 has hydrophilic hydroxy groups. The receptors have ligand-binding units that interact with cationic amphiphiles such as 2-phenethylamine (PA). Conductance study revealed that the receptors hardly show ion transportation at the ligand-free state. After ligand binding involving a conformational change, receptor 1 bearing TIPS termini displays a significant current enhancement due to ion transportation. The current substantially diminishes upon addition of $\beta$-cyclodextrin ($\beta$CD) that scavenges the ligand from the receptor. Importantly, the receptor again turns into the conductive state by the second addition of PA, and the activation/deactivation of the ion transportation can be repeated. In contrast, receptor 2 bearing the hydroxy terminal groups hardly exhibits ion transportation, suggesting the importance of terminal TIPS groups of 1 that likely anchor the receptor in the membrane.},

@article{Braun2014,
abstract = {We have developed an algorithm to determine membrane structure, area per lipid, and bending rigidity from molecular dynamics simulations of lipid vesicles. Current methods to extract structure from vesicle simulations define densities relative to the global center of mass of the vesicle. This approach ignores the long-wavelength fluctuations (undulations) that develop across the sphere and broaden the underlying structure. Our method establishes a local reference frame by defining a radially undulating reference surface (URS) and thereby removes the broadening effect of the undulations. Using an arc-length low-pass filter, we render the URS by defining the bilayer midplane on an equi-angular $\theta$, ϕ-grid (colatitude, longitude). This surface is then expanded onto a truncated series of spherical harmonics. The spherical harmonic coefficients characterize the long-wavelength fluctuations that define both the local reference frame-used to determine the bilayer's structure-and the area per lipid (A L) along the undulating surface. Additionally, the resulting power spectrum of spherical harmonic coefficients can be fit to a Helfrich continuum model for membrane bending in spherical geometry to extract bending rigidity (k c). k c values determined for both DMPC and DMPC + cholesterol (30 mol %) vesicles are consistent with values from corresponding flat-patch systems determined using an independent, previously published spectral method. These new tools to accurately extract structure, A L, and k c should prove invaluable in evaluating the construction and equilibration of lipid vesicle simulations.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics target APC35832, a 14.7-kDa cytosolic protein from Bacillus stearothermophilus, has been determined at 1.3 A resolution by the single anomalous diffraction method from a mercury soaked crystal. The APC35832 protein is a representative of large group of bacterial and archeal proteins entirely consisting of the Toprim (topoisomerase-primase) domain. This domain is found in the catalytic centers of many enzymes catalyzing phosphodiester bond formation or cleavage, but the function of small Toprim domain proteins remains unknown. Consistent with the sequence analysis, the APC35832 structure shows a conserved Toprim fold, with a central 4-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by four alpha-helixes. Comparison of the APC35832 structure with its closest structural homolog, the catalytic core of bacteriophage T7 primase, revealed structural conservation of a metal binding site and isothermal titration calorimetry indicates that APC35832 binds Mg2+ with a sub-millimolar dissociation constant (K(d)). The APC35832-Mg2+ complex structure was determined at 1.65 A and reveals the role of conserved acidic residues in Mg2+ ion coordination. The structural similarities to other Toprim domain containing proteins and potential function and substrates of APC35832 are discussed in this article.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Porins provide diffusion channels for salts and small organic molecules in the outer membrane of bacteria. In OmpF from Escherichia coli and related porins, an electrostatic field across the channel and a potential, originating from a surplus of negative charges, create moderate cation selectivity. Here, we investigate the strongly anion-selective porin Omp32 from Comamonas acidovorans, which is closely homologous to the porins of pathogenic Bordetella and Neisseria species. RESULTS: The crystal structure of Omp32 was determined to a resolution of 2.1 A using single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS). The porin consists of a 16-stranded beta barrel with eight external loops and seven periplasmic turns. Loops 3 and 8, together with a protrusion located within beta-strand 2, narrow the cross-section of the pore considerably. Arginine residues create a charge filter in the constriction zone and a positive surface potential at the external and periplasmic faces. One sulfate ion was bound to Arg38 in the channel constriction zone. A peptide of 5.8 kDa appeared bound to Omp32 in a 1:1 stoichiometry on the periplasmic side close to the symmetry axis of the trimer. Eight amino acids of this peptide could be identified, revealing specific interactions with beta-strand 1 of the porin. CONCLUSIONS: The Omp32 structure explains the strong anion selectivity of this porin. Selectivity is conferred by a positive potential, which is not attenuated by negative charges inside the channel, and by an extremely narrow constriction zone. Moreover, Omp32 represents the anchor molecule for a peptide which is homologous to proteins that link the outer membrane to the cell wall peptidoglycan.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The integral outer membrane protein X (OmpX) from Escherichia coli belongs to a family of highly conserved bacterial proteins that promote bacterial adhesion to and entry into mammalian cells. Moreover, these proteins have a role in the resistance against attack by the human complement system. Here we present the first crystal structure of a member of this family. RESULTS: The crystal structure of OmpX from E. coli was determined at 1.9 A resolution using multiple isomorphous replacement. OmpX consists of an eight-stranded antiparallel all-next-neighbor beta barrel. The structure shows two girdles of aromatic amino acid residues and a ribbon of nonpolar residues that attach to the membrane interior. The core of the barrel consists of an extended hydrogen-bonding network of highly conserved residues. OmpX thus resembles an inverse micelle. The structure explains the dramatically improved crystal quality of OmpX containing the mutation His100-->Asn, which made the X-ray analysis possible. The coordination spheres of two bound platinum ions are described. CONCLUSIONS: The OmpX structure shows that within a family of virulence-related membrane proteins, the membrane-spanning part of the protein is much better conserved than the extracellular loops. Moreover, these loops form a protruding beta sheet, the edge of which presumably binds to external proteins. It is suggested that this type of binding promotes cell adhesion and invasion and helps defend against the complement system. Although OmpX has the same beta-sheet topology as the structurally related outer membrane protein A (OmpA), their barrels differ with respect to the shear numbers and internal hydrogen-bonding networks.},

abstract = {"Real time" molecular dynamics simulations of water permeation through human aquaporin-1 (AQP1) and the bacterial glycerol facilitator GlpF are presented. We obtained time-resolved, atomic-resolution models of the permeation mechanism across these highly selective membrane channels. Both proteins act as two-stage filters: Conserved fingerprint [asparagine-proline-alanine (NPA)] motifs form a selectivity-determining region; a second (aromatic/arginine) region is proposed to function as a proton filter. Hydrophobic regions near the NPA motifs are rate-limiting water barriers. In AQP1, a fine-tuned water dipole rotation during passage is essential for water selectivity. In GlpF, a glycerol-mediated "induced fit" gating motion is proposed to generate selectivity for glycerol over water.},

abstract = {In the accompanying paper we derived a set of principles that, we argue, govern the structure of beta-sheet barrels. Barrel structures are classified in terms of two integral parameters: the number of strands in the beta-sheet, n, and a measure of the stagger in the beta-sheet, S. We derived a set of equations that show how the (n, S) values of a barrel structure determine the arrangement of its strands; its general shape; the twist and coiling of the beta-sheet, and the arrangement of residues in the barrel interior. This work suggested that there are ten different combinations of n and S that form barrels with good beta-sheet geometries and interiors close packed by beta-sheet residues. In this paper we demonstrate the validity of these principles. We analyse in detail the observed structures of 39 different beta-sheet barrels. These structures include representatives of all the different barrel structures currently known and for which atomic co-ordinates are available. We show that the observed arrangement of the strands, and the extent of the twist and coiling of the beta-sheets, are very close to those calculated from the (n, S) values for the barrel. Of the 39 structures, 34 have one of the ten (n, S) values that we expect to form barrels with good beta-sheet geometries and interiors close packed by beta-sheet residues. The other five have one of two (n, S) values that give good beta-sheet geometries but radii so large the beta-sheet residues leave cavities at the centre of the barrels. In at least four of these cavities have a functional role.},

Cholesterol binds mammalian VDAC, and we investigated the effects of binding to human VDAC1 with atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that totaled 1.4 $\mu$s. We docked cholesterol to specific sites on VDAC that were previously identified with NMR, and we tested the reliability of multiple docking results in each site with simulations. The most favorable binding modes were used to build a VDAC model with cholesterol occupying five unique sites, and during multiple 100 ns simulations, cholesterol stably and reproducibly remained bound to the protein. For comparison, VDAC was simulated in systems with identical components but with cholesterol initially unbound. The dynamics of loops that connect adjacent $\beta$-strands were most affected by bound cholesterol, with the averaged root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of multiple residues altered by 20-30%. Cholesterol binding also stabilized charged residues inside the channel and localized the surrounding electrostatic potentials. Despite this, ion diffusion through the channel was not significantly affected by bound cholesterol, as evidenced by multi-ion potential of mean force measurements. While we observed modest effects of cholesterol on the open channel, our model will be particularly useful in experiments that investigate how cholesterol affects VDAC function under applied electrochemical forces, and also how other ligands and proteins interact with the channel.},

Hydrophobic pores are formed in the lipid bilayer by spontaneous fluctuations. If these water-filled defects extend to a radius of 0.3 to 0.5 nm, a hydrophilic pore is formed by reorientation of the lipid molecules. This process is favoured by a potential difference across the membrane. The conductivity of the pores depends on membrane voltage, and the type of this dependence changes with the radius of the pore. Hydrophilic pores of an effective radius of 0.6 up to more than 1 nm are formed, which account for the membrane conductivity increase observed. The characteristic times of changes in average radius and number of pores during the voltage pulse and after it are investigated.},

abstract = {The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is a key signaling mechanism in apoptosis. Although extramitochondrial proteins are thought to initiate this release, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Cytochrome c (cyt c) binds to and penetrates lipid structures containing the inner mitochondrial membrane lipid cardiolipin (CL), leading to protein conformational changes and increased peroxidase activity. We describe here a direct visualization of a fluorescent cyt c crossing synthetic, CL-containing membranes in the absence of other proteins. We observed strong binding of cyt c to CL in phospholipid vesicles and bursts of cyt c leakage across the membrane. Passive fluorescent markers such as carboxyfluorescein and a 10-kDa dextran polymer crossed the membrane simultaneously with cyt c, although larger dextrans did not. The data show that these bursts result from the opening of lipid pores formed by the cyt c-CL conjugate. Pore formation and cyt c leakage were significantly reduced in the presence of ATP. We suggest a model, consistent with these findings, in which the formation of toroidal lipid pores is driven by initial cyt c-induced negative spontaneous membrane curvature and subsequent protein unfolding interactions. Our results suggest that the CL-cyt c interaction may be sufficient to allow cyt c permeation of mitochondrial membranes and that cyt c may contribute to its own escape from mitochondria during apoptosis.},

abstract = {The transbilayer pores formed by ion channel proteins contain extended columns of water molecules. The dynamic properties of such waters have been suggested to differ from those of water in its bulk state. Molecular dynamics simulations of ion channel models solvated within and at the mouths of their pores are used to investigate the dynamics and structure of intra-pore water. Three classes of channel model are investigated: a) parallel bundles of hydrophobic (Ala20) alpha-helices; b) eight-stranded hydrophobic (Ala10) antiparallel beta-barrels; and c) parallel bundles of amphipathic alpha-helices (namely, delta-toxin, alamethicin, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor M2 helix). The self-diffusion coefficients of water molecules within the pores are reduced significantly relative to bulk water in all of the models. Water rotational reorientation rates are also reduced within the pores, particularly in those pores formed by alpha-helix bundles. In the narrowest pore (that of the Ala20 pentameric helix bundle) self-diffusion coefficients and reorientation rates of intra-pore waters are reduced by approximately an order of magnitude relative to bulk solvent. In Ala20 helix bundles the water dipoles orient antiparallel to the helix dipoles. Such dipole/dipole interaction between water and pore may explain how water-filled ion channels may be formed by hydrophobic helices. In the bundles of amphipathic helices the orientation of water dipoles is modulated by the presence of charged side chains. No preferential orientation of water dipoles relative to the pore axis is observed in the hydrophobic beta-barrel models.},

Here, we elucidate the ATP hydrolysis cycle of SecA from Escherichia coli by transient and steady-state methods. The basal ATPase activity of SecA is very slow with the release of ADP being some 600-fold slower than hydrolysis. Upon binding to SecYEG the release of ADP is stimulated but remains rate-limiting. ADP release is fastest in the fully coupled system when a substrate protein is being translocated; in this case hydrolysis and ADP release occur at approximately the same rate. The data imply that ADP dissociation from SecA is accompanied by a structural rearrangement that is strongly coupled to the protein interface and protein translocation through SecYEG.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The knowledge of protein structure is not sufficient for understanding and controlling its function. Function is a dynamic property. Although protein structural information has been rapidly accumulating in databases, little effort has been invested to date toward systematically characterizing protein dynamics. The recent success of analytical methods based on elastic network models, and in particular the Gaussian Network Model (GNM), permits us to perform a high-throughput analysis of the collective dynamics of proteins.

RESULTS: We computed the GNM dynamics for 20 058 structures from the Protein Data Bank, and generated information on the equilibrium dynamics at the level of individual residues. The results are stored on a web-based system called iGNM and configured so as to permit the users to visualize or download the results through a standard web browser using a simple search engine. Static and animated images for describing the conformational mobility of proteins over a broad range of normal modes are accessible, along with an online calculation engine available for newly deposited structures. A case study of the dynamics of 20 non-homologous hydrolases is presented to illustrate the utility of the iGNM database for identifying key residues that control the cooperative motions and revealing the connection between collective dynamics and catalytic activity.},

abstract = {The permeation of hydrophobic, cylindrical nanopores by water molecules and ions is investigated under equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium conditions by extensive molecular-dynamics simulations. Neglecting the chemical structure of the confining pore surface, we focus on the effects of pore radius and electric field on permeation. The simulations confirm the intermittent filling of the pore by water, reported earlier under equilibrium conditions for pore radii larger than a critical radius R(c). Below this radius, water can still permeate the pore under the action of a strong electric field generated by an ion concentration imbalance at both ends of the pore embedded in a structureless membrane. The water driven into the channel undergoes considerable electrostriction characterized by a mean density up to twice the bulk density and by a dramatic drop in dielectric permittivity which can be traced back to a considerable distortion of the hydrogen-bond network inside the pore. The free-energy barrier to ion permeation is estimated by a variant of umbrella sampling for Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+), and Cl(-) ions, and correlates well with known solvation free energies in bulk water. Starting from an initial imbalance in ion concentration, equilibrium is gradually restored by successive ion passages through the water-filled pore. At each passage the electric field across the pore drops, reducing the initial electrostriction, until the pore, of radius less than R(c), closes to water and hence to ion transport, thus providing a possible mechanism for voltage-dependent gating of hydrophobic pores.},

abstract = {A potential of mean force (PMF) that provides the free energy of a thermally driven system along some chosen reaction coordinate (RC) is a useful descriptor of systems characterized by complex, high dimensional potential energy surfaces. Umbrella sampling window simulations use potential energy restraints to provide more uniform sampling along a RC so that potential energy barriers that would otherwise make equilibrium sampling computationally difficult can be overcome. Combining the results from the different biased window trajectories can be accomplished using the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM). Here, we provide an analysis of the variance of a PMF along the reaction coordinate. We assume that the potential restraints used for each window lead to Gaussian distributions for the window reaction coordinate densities and that the data sampling in each window is from an equilibrium ensemble sampled so that successive points are statistically independent. Also, we assume that neighbor window densities overlap, as required in WHAM, and that further-than-neighbor window density overlap is negligible. Then, an analytic expression for the variance of the PMF along the reaction coordinate at a desired level of spatial resolution can be generated. The variance separates into a sum over all windows with two kinds of contributions: One from the variance of the biased window density normalized by the total biased window density and the other from the variance of the local (for each window's coordinate range) PMF. Based on the desired spatial resolution of the PMF, the former variance can be minimized relative to that from the latter. The method is applied to a model system that has features of a complex energy landscape evocative of a protein with two conformational states separated by a free energy barrier along a collective reaction coordinate. The variance can be constructed from data that is already available from the WHAM PMF construction.},

abstract = {Magnesium translocation across cell membranes is essential for numerous physiological processes. Three recently reported crystal structures of the CorA magnesium transport system revealed a surprising architecture, with a bundle of giant $\alpha$-helices forming a 60-\AA-long pore that extends beyond the membrane before widening into a funnel-shaped cytosolic domain. The presence of divalent cations in putative intracellular regulation sites suggests that these structures correspond to the closed conformation of CorA. To examine the nature of the conduction pathway, we performed 110-ns molecular-dynamics simulations of two of these structures in a lipid bilayer with and without regulatory ions. The results show that a 15-\AA-long hydrophobic constriction straddling the membrane-cytosol interface constitutes a steric bottleneck whose location coincides with an electrostatic barrier opposing cation translocation. In one of the simulations, structural relaxation after the removal of regulatory ions led to concerted changes in the tilt of the pore helices, resulting in iris-like dilation and spontaneous hydration of the hydrophobic neck. This simple and robust mechanism is consistent with the regulation of pore opening by intracellular magnesium concentration, and explains the unusual architecture of CorA. © 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The electrostatic properties of lipid membranes are of profound importance as they are directly associated with membrane potential and, consequently, with numerous membrane-mediated biological phenomena. Here we address a number of methodological issues related to the computation of the electrostatic potential from atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayers. We discuss two slightly different forms of Poisson equation that are normally used to calculate the membrane potential: (i) a classical form when the potential and the electric field are chosen to be zero on one of the sides of a simulation box and (ii) an alternative form, when the potential is set to be the same on the opposite sides of a simulation box. Both forms differ by a position-dependent correction term, which has been shown to be proportional to the overall dipole moment of a bilayer system (for neutral systems). For symmetric bilayers we demonstrate that both approaches give essentially the same potential profiles, provided that simulations are long enough (a production run of at least 100 ns is required) and that fluctuations of the center of mass of a bilayer are properly accounted for. In contrast, for asymmetric lipid bilayers, the second approach is no longer appropriate due to a nonzero net dipole moment across a simulation box with a single asymmetric bilayer. We demonstrate that in this case the electrostatic potential can adequately be described by the classical form of Poisson equation, provided that it is employed in conjunction with tin-foil boundary conditions, which exactly balance a nonzero surface charge of a periodically replicated multibilayer system. Furthermore, we show that vacuum boundary conditions give qualitatively similar potential profiles for asymmetric lipid bilayers as compared to the conventional periodic boundaries, but accurate determination of the transmembrane potential difference is then hindered due to detachment of some water dipoles from bulk aqueous solution to vacuum.},

abstract = {The X-ray structure of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) has recently provided structural insight into this family of ion channels at high resolution. The structure shows a homo-pentameric protein with a barrel-stave architecture that defines an ion-conduction pore located on the fivefold axis of symmetry. In this structure, the wide aqueous vestibule that is encircled by the extracellular ligand-binding domains of the five subunits narrows to a discontinuous pore that spans the lipid bilayer. The pore is constricted by bulky hydrophobic residues towards the extracellular side, which probably serve as barriers that prevent the diffusion of ions. This interrupted pore architecture in ELIC thus depicts a non-conducting conformation of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel, the thermodynamically stable state in the absence of bound ligand. As ligand binding promotes pore opening in these ion channels and the specific ligand for ELIC has not yet been identified, we have turned our attention towards a homologous protein from the cyanobacterium Gloebacter violaceus (GLIC). GLIC was shown to form proton-gated channels that are activated by a pH decrease on the extracellular side and that do not desensitize after activation. Both prokaryotic proteins, ELIC and GLIC form ion channels that are selective for cations over anions with poor discrimination among monovalent cations, characteristics that resemble the conduction properties of the cation-selective branch of the family that includes acetylcholine and serotonin receptors. Here we present the X-ray structure of GLIC at 3.1 A resolution. The structure reveals a conformation of the channel that is distinct from ELIC and that probably resembles the open state. In combination, both structures suggest a novel gating mechanism for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels where channel opening proceeds by a change in the tilt of the pore-forming helices.},

abstract = {Active control of ion transport in nanoscale channels is attracting increasing attention. Recently, experimental and theoretical results have verified that depending on the charged surface of nanopores, the solution inside nanopores can contain either negative or positive ions, which does not happen in macroscale channels. However, the control of the surface chemistry of synthetic nanopores is difficult and the design of nanotubes with novel recognition mechanisms that regulate the ionic selectivity of negative and positive charges remains a challenge. We present here a design for an ion-selective nanopore that is controllable by external charges. Our molecular dynamics simulations show that this remarkable selectivity can be switched from predominantly negative to positive ions and that the magnitude of the ionic flux can be varied by changing the distance of the external charges. The results suggest that the hydration structures around ions play a prominent role in the selectivity process, which is tuned by the external charge. These studies may be useful for developing ways to control the behavior, properties and chemical composition of liquids and provide possible technical applications for nanofluidic field effect transistors.},

abstract = {Orthologs of the pentameric receptor channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems have been found in several bacterial species and in a single archaea genus. Recent X-ray structures of bacterial and invertebrate pentameric receptors point to a striking conservation of the structural features within the whole family, even between distant prokaryotic and eukaryotic members. These structural data reveal general principles of molecular organization that allow allosteric membrane proteins to mediate chemoelectric transduction. Notably, several conformations have been solved, including open and closed channels with distinct global tertiary and quaternary structure. The data reveal features of the ion channel architecture and of diverse categories of binding sites, such as those that bind orthosteric ligands, including neurotransmitters, and those that bind allosteric modulators, such as general anesthetics, ivermectin, or lipids. In this review, we summarize the most recent data, discuss insights into the mechanism of action in these systems, and elaborate on newly opened avenues for drug design. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

Specifically, using molecular dynamics simulations, we found that water molecules permeate through the (5,5) boron nitride nanotube, while a (5,5) carbon nanotube (CNT) of approximately the same diameter does not conduct water. The relatively strong interactions between the nitride atoms of the BNNT and water molecules play a key role in the continuous wetting behavior of the BNNT. The properties of water, such as the axial diffusion coefficient and the hydrogen bonding, inside the (5,5) BNNT were found to be comparable to those inside the (6,6) CNT, even though the diameter of the (5,5) BNNT is about 1.3 \AA smaller than that of the (6,6) CNT.},

Bacterial mechanosensitive channels MscL and MscS are the best-studied tension-gated nanopores, yet the key physical factors that define their gating are still hotly debated. Here we present estimations, simulations and experimental results showing that hydration of the pore might be one of the major parameters defining the thermodynamics and kinetics of mechanosensitive channel gating. We associate closing of channel pores with complete dehydration of the hydrophobic gate (occlusion by 'vapor lock') and formation of two water-vapor interfaces above and below the constriction. The opening path is the expansion of these interfaces, ultimately leading to wetting of the hydrophobic pore, which does not appear to be the exact reverse of the closing path, thus producing hysteresis. We discuss specifically the role of polar groups (glycines) buried in narrow closed conformations but exposed in the open states that change the wetting characteristics of the pore lining and stabilize conductive states of the channels.},

This lack of a ligand response has been thought to result from poor surface expression, poor assembly, or lack of an agonist binding domain. The Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated chloride channel subunit GluClbeta responds to glutamate as a homomeric channel while the GluClalpha subunit is insensitive. A chimera between GluClalpha and GluClbeta was used to suggest that major determinants for glutamate binding are present on the GluClalpha N terminus. Amino acid substitutions in the presumed pore of GluClalpha conferred direct glutamate gating indicating that GluClalpha is deficient in coupling of ligand binding to channel gating. Heteromeric channels of GluClalpha+beta may differ from the prototypic muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in that they have the potential to bind ligand to all of the subunits forming the channel.},

abstract = {Bacterial porins, which allow the passage of solutes across the outer bacterial membrane, are structurally well characterized.

In a comparative study, we have performed Brownian dynamics simulations to obtain statistically significant transfer efficiencies for cations and anions through matrix porin OmpF, osmoporin OmpK36, phosphoporin PhoE and two OmpF charge mutants. The simulations show that the electrostatic potential at the highly charged channel constriction serves to enhance ion permeability of either cations or anions, dependent on the type of porin. At the same time translocation of counterions is not severely impeded. At the constriction, cations and anions follow distinct trajectories, due to the segregation of basic and acidic protein residues. Simulated ion selectivity and relative conductance agree well with experimental values, and are dependent crucially on the charge constellation at the pore constriction. The experimentally observed decrease in ion selectivity and single channel conductance with increasing ionic strength is well reproduced and can be attributed to electrostatic shielding of the pore lining.},

For bare graphene, we encounter a paradox: whereas contaminated graphene nanopores facilitated DNA translocation well, clean crystalline graphene pores very quickly exhibit clogging of the pore. We attribute this to strong interactions between DNA nucleotides and graphene, yielding sticking and irreversible pore closure. We develop a general strategy to noncovalently tailor the hydrophobic surface of graphene by designing a dedicated self-assembled monolayer of pyrene ethylene glycol, which renders the surface hydrophilic. We demonstrate that this prevents DNA to adsorb on graphene and show that single-stranded DNA can now be detected in graphene nanopores with excellent nanopore durability and reproducibility.},

We identify ion permeation pathways that are likely to be populated using coarse-grain Monte Carlo simulations. Next, we use these pathways as reaction coordinates for umbrella sampling-based free energy simulations. We find distinct tubelike pathways connecting specific binding sites for K(+) and, more pronounced, for Cl(-) ions. Both ions permeate the porin preserving almost all of their first hydration shell. The calculated free energy barriers are G(#) ≈ 4 kJ/mol and G(#) ≈ 8 kJ/mol for Cl(-) and K(+), respectively. Within the approximations associated with these values, discussed in detail in this work, we suggest that the porin is slightly selective for Cl(-) versus K(+). Our suggestion is consistent with the experimentally observed weak Cl(-) over K(+) selectivity. A rationale for the latter is suggested by a comparison with previous calculations on strongly anion selective porins.},

@article{Soares1995,
abstract = {L3 loop-mediated mechanisms for pore closing in porin are investigated with molecular dynamics simulation, using an approach that can be related to the phenomenon of voltage gating. Voltage gating is seen as a perturbation of the electrostatic screening inside the porin pore where, by the influence of the potential gradient, water and counter-ion distribution can be slightly displaced from their equilibrium distribution. This is simulated by perturbing the screening electrostatics of ionizable groups inside the pore. Under these conditions, a localized conformational change takes place, involving 12 (Ile102-Ala113) out of the 44 residues of the loop. The pore is reduced to a sixth of its open state size. The conformational change can be achieved with a small perturbation and it is reversible once the perturbation is switched off (relaxation process). Other types of behaviour predominating at higher simulation temperatures are found for the loop, involving an extra conformational change in the Thr92-Asp96 loop segment. This conformational change completely closes the pore, but is not reversible under the simulation conditions.

Results from end-group engineering and covalent capture as O-NDI hairpins suggested that self-assembly into transmembrane O-NDI bundles is essential for activity. A halide topology VI (Cl > F > Br approximately I, Cl/Br approximately Cl/I > 7) implied strong anion binding along the anion-pi slides with relatively weak contributions from size exclusion (F >or= OAc). Anomalous mole fraction effects (AMFE) supported the occurrence of multiion hopping along the pi-acidic O-NDI rods. The existence of anion-pi interactions was corroborated by high-level ab initio and DFT calculations. The latter revealed positive NDI quadrupole moments far beyond the hexafluorobenzene standard. Computational studies further suggested that anion binding occurs at the confined, pi-acidic edges of the sticky NDI surface and is influenced by the nature of the phenyl spacer between two NDIs. With regard to methods development, a detailed analysis of the detection of ion selectivity with the HPTS assay including AMFE in vesicles is provided.},

abstract = {Cholesterol Dependent Cytolysins (CDCs) are important bacterial virulence factors that form large (200-300 \AA) membrane embedded pores in target cells. Currently, insights from X-ray crystallography, biophysical and single particle cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) experiments suggest that soluble monomers first interact with the membrane surface via a C-terminal Immunoglobulin-like domain (Ig; Domain 4). Membrane bound oligomers then assemble into a prepore oligomeric form, following which the prepore assembly collapses towards the membrane surface, with concomitant release and insertion of the membrane spanning subunits. During this rearrangement it is proposed that Domain 2, a region comprising three $\beta$-strands that links the pore forming region (Domains 1 and 3) and the Ig domain, must undergo a significant yet currently undetermined, conformational change. Here we address this problem through a systematic molecular modeling and structural bioinformatics approach. Our work shows that simple rigid body rotations may account for the observed collapse of the prepore towards the membrane surface. Support for this idea comes from analysis of published cryo-EM maps of the pneumolysin pore, available crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations. The latter data in particular reveal that Domains 1, 2 and 4 are able to undergo significant rotational movements with respect to each other. Together, our data provide new and testable insights into the mechanism of pore formation by CDCs.},

@article{Bennett2014a,
abstract = {Conspectus The defects and pores within lipid membranes are scientifically interesting and have a number of biological applications. Although lipid bilayers are extremely thin hydrophobic barriers, just ∼3 nm thick, they include diverse chemistry and have complex structures. Bilayers are soft and dynamic, and as a result, they can bend and deform in response to different stimuli by means of structural changes in their component lipids. Though defects occur within these structures, their transience and small size have made it difficult to characterize them. However, with recent advances in computer power and computational modeling techniques, researchers can now use simulations as a powerful tool to probe the mechanism and energies of defect and pore formation in a number of situations. In this Account, we present results from our detailed molecular dynamics computer simulations of hydrophilic pores and related defects in lipid bilayers at an atomistic level. Electroporation can be used to increase the permeability of cellular membranes, with potential therapeutic applications. Atomistic simulations of electroporation have illustrated the molecular details of this process, including the importance of water dipole interactions at the water-membrane interface. Characterization of the lipid-protein interactions provides an important tool for understanding transmembrane protein structure and thermodynamic stability. Atomistic simulations give a detailed picture of the free energies of model peptides and side chains in lipid membranes; the energetic cost of defect formation strongly influences the energies of interactions between lipids and polar and charged residues. Many antimicrobial peptides form hydrophilic pores in lipid membranes, killing bacteria or cancer cells. On the basis of simulation data, at least some of these peptides form defects and pores near the center of the bilayer, with a common disordered structure where hydrated headgroups form an approximately toroidal shape. The localization and trafficking of lipids supports general membrane structure and a number of important signaling cascades, such as those involving ceramide, diacylglycerol, and cholesterol. Atomistic simulations have determined the rates and free energies of lipid flip-flop. During the flip-flop of most phosphatidylcholine lipids, a hydrophilic pore forms when the headgroup moves near the center of the bilayer. Simulations have provided novel insight into many features of defects and pores in lipid membranes. Simulation data from very different systems and models show how water penetration and defect formation can determine the free energies of many membrane processes. Bilayers can deform and allow transient defects and pores when exposed to a diverse range of stimuli. Future work will explore many aspects of membrane defects with increased resolution and scope, including the study of more complex lipid mixtures, membrane domains, and large-scale membrane remodeling. Such studies will examine processes including vesicle budding and fusion, non-bilayer lipid phases, and interactions between lipid bilayers and other biomolecules. Simulations provide information that complements experimental studies, allowing microscopic insight into experimental observations and suggesting novel hypotheses and experiments. These studies should enable a deeper understanding of the role of lipid bilayers in cellular biology and support the development of future lipid-based biotechnology.},

However, despite all the exciting developments in the field, sequencing DNA using a nanopore has yet to be demonstrated.

We have recently shown that such tasks could be accomplished through computation. This chapter provides step-by-step instructions of how to build atomic scale models of biological and solid-state nanopore systems, use the molecular dynamics method to simulate the electric field-driven transport of ions and DNA through the nanopores, and analyze the results of such computational experiments.},

abstract = {Bacterial Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC) is activated to cation permeation upon lowering the solution pH. Its function can be modulated by anesthetic halothane. In the present work, we integrate molecular dynamics (MD) and Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations to elucidate the ion conduction, charge selectivity, and halothane modulation mechanisms in GLIC, based on recently resolved X-ray crystal structures of the open-channel GLIC. MD calculations of the potential of mean force (PMF) for a Na(+) revealed two energy barriers in the extracellular domain (R109 and K38) and at the hydrophobic gate of transmembrane domain (I233), respectively. An energy well for Na(+) was near the intracellular entrance: the depth of this energy well was modulated strongly by the protonation state of E222. The energy barrier for Cl(-) was found to be 3-4 times higher than that for Na(+). Ion permeation characteristics were determined through BD simulations using a hybrid MD/continuum electrostatics approach to evaluate the energy profiles governing the ion movement. The resultant channel conductance and a near-zero permeability ratio (P(Cl)/P(Na)) were comparable to experimental data. On the basis of these calculations, we suggest that a ring of five E222 residues may act as an electrostatic gate. In addition, the hydrophobic gate region may play a role in charge selectivity due to a higher dehydration energy barrier for Cl(-) ions. The effect of halothane on the Na(+) PMF was also evaluated. Halothane was found to perturb salt bridges in GLIC that may be crucial for channel gating and open-channel stability, but had no significant impact on the single ion PMF profiles.},

abstract = {Unlike random heteropolymers, natural proteins fold into unique ordered structures. Understanding how these are encoded in amino-acid sequences is complicated by energetically unfavourable non-ideal features--for example kinked $\alpha$-helices, bulged $\beta$-strands, strained loops and buried polar groups--that arise in proteins from evolutionary selection for biological function or from neutral drift. Here we describe an approach to designing ideal protein structures stabilized by completely consistent local and non-local interactions. The approach is based on a set of rules relating secondary structure patterns to protein tertiary motifs, which make possible the design of funnel-shaped protein folding energy landscapes leading into the target folded state. Guided by these rules, we designed sequences predicted to fold into ideal protein structures consisting of $\alpha$-helices, $\beta$-strands and minimal loops. Designs for five different topologies were found to be monomeric and very stable and to adopt structures in solution nearly identical to the computational models. These results illuminate how the folding funnels of natural proteins arise and provide the foundation for engineering a new generation of functional proteins free from natural evolution.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations hold the promise of providing an atomic-level description of protein folding that cannot easily be obtained from experiments. Here, we examine the extent to which the molecular mechanics force field used in such simulations might influence the observed folding pathways. To that end, we performed equilibrium simulations of a fastfolding variant of the villin headpiece using four different force fields. In each simulation, we observed a large number of transitions between the unfolded and folded states, and in all four cases, both the rate of folding and the structure of the native state were in good agreement with experiments. We found, however, that the folding mechanism and the properties of the unfolded state depend substantially on the choice of force field. We thus conclude that although it is important to match a single, experimentally determined structure and folding rate, this does not ensure that a given simulation will provide a unique and correct description of the full free-energy surface and the mechanism of folding. © 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {FadL is an important member of the family of fatty acid transport proteins within membranes. In this study, 11 conventional molecular dynamics (CMD) and 25 steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations were performed to investigate the dynamic mechanism of transport of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) across FadL. The CMD simulations addressed the intrinsically dynamic behavior of FadL. Both the CMD and SMD simulations revealed that a fatty acid molecule can move diffusively to a high-affinity site (HAS) from a low-affinity site (LAS). During this process, the swing motion of the L3 segment and the hydrophobic interaction between the fatty acid and FadL could play important roles. Furthermore, 22 of the SMD simulations revealed that fatty acids can pass through the gap between the hatch domain and the transmembrane domain (TMD) by different pathways. SMD simulations identified nine possible pathways for dodecanoic acid (DA) threading the barrel of FadL. The binding free energy profiles between DA and FadL along the MD trajectories indicate that all of the possible pathways are energetically favorable for the transport of fatty acids; however, one pathway (path VI) might be the most probable pathway for DA transport. The reasonability and reliability of this study were further demonstrated by correlating the MD simulation results with the available mutagenesis results. On the basis of the simulations, a mechanism for the full-length transport process of DA from the extracellular side to the periplasmic space mediated by FadL is proposed.},

@article{Roux2004d,
abstract = {The goal of this review is to establish a broad and rigorous theoretical framework to describe ion permeation through biological channels. This framework is developed in the context of atomic models on the basis of the statistical mechanical projection-operator formalism of Mori and Zwanzig. The review is divided into two main parts. The first part introduces the fundamental concepts needed to construct a hierarchy of dynamical models at different level of approximation. In particular, the potential of mean force (PMF) as a configuration-dependent free energy is introduced, and its significance concerning equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena is discussed. In addition, fundamental aspects of membrane electrostatics, with a particular emphasis on the influence of the transmembrane potential, as well as important computational techniques for extracting essential information from all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are described and discussed. The first part of the review provides a theoretical formalism to 'translate' the information from the atomic structure into the familiar language of phenomenological models of ion permeation. The second part is aimed at reviewing and contrasting results obtained in recent computational studies of three very different channels: the gramicidin A (gA) channel, which is a narrow one-ion pore (at moderate concentration), the KcsA channel from Streptomyces lividans, which is a narrow multi-ion pore, and the outer membrane matrix porin F (OmpF) from Escherichia coli, which is a trimer of three beta-barrel subunits each forming wide aqueous multi-ion pores. Comparison with experiments demonstrates that current computational models are approaching semi-quantitative accuracy and are able to provide significant insight into the microscopic mechanisms of ion conduction and selectivity. We conclude that all-atom MD with explicit water molecules can represent important structural features of complex biological channels accurately, including such features as the location of ion-binding sites along the permeation pathway. We finally discuss the broader issue of the validity of ion permeation models and an outlook to the future.},

Using single-channel electrophysiological recordings, we studied the poorly understood ring of four glutamates (and one glutamine) that dominates this catalytic effect in the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ('the intermediate ring of charge'). We show that all four wild-type glutamate side chains are deprotonated in the range of 6.0-9.0 pH, that only two of them contribute to the size of the single-channel current, that these side chains must be able to adopt alternate conformations that either allow or prevent their negative charges from increasing the rate of cation conduction and that the location of these glutamate side chains squarely at one of the ends of the transmembrane pore is critical for their largely unshifted pK(a) values and for the unanticipated impact of their conformational flexibility on cation permeation.},

The structure showed a 'closed umbrella' shape with a long helix consisting of the cytoplasmic coiled coil and the voltage-sensing helix, S4, and featured a wide inner-accessible vestibule. Two out of three arginines in S4 were located below the phenylalanine constituting the gating charge-transfer center. The extracellular region of each protomer coordinated a Zn(2+), thus suggesting that Zn(2+) stabilizes the resting state of Hv1 by competing for acidic residues that otherwise form salt bridges with voltage-sensing positive charges on S4. These findings provide a platform for understanding the general principles of voltage sensing and proton permeation.},

abstract = {Nanoscale pores are ubiquitous in biological systems while artificial nanopores are being fabricated for an increasing number of applications. Biological pores are responsible for the transport of various ions and substrates between the different compartments of biological systems separated by membranes while artificial pores are aimed at emulating such transport properties. As an experimental method, electrophysiology has proven to be an important nano-analytical tool for the study of substrate transport through nanopores utilizing ion current measurements as a probe for the detection. Independent of the pore type, i.e., biological or synthetic, and objective of the study, i.e., to model cellular processes of ion transport or electrophysiological experiments, it has become increasingly important to understand the dynamics of ions in nanoscale confinements. To this end, numerical simulations have established themselves as an indispensable tool to decipher ion transport processes through biological as well as artificial nanopores. This article provides an overview of different theoretical and computational methods to study ion transport in general and to calculate ion conductance in particular. Potential new improvements in the existing methods and their applications are highlighted wherever applicable. Moreover, representative examples are given describing the ion transport through biological and synthetic nanopores as well as the high selectivity of ion channels. Special emphasis is placed on the usage of molecular dynamics simulations which already have demonstrated their potential to unravel ion transport properties at an atomic level.},

Although there is general agreement that the second transmembrane domain (M2) lines the pore, the position of the gate in the M2 is less certain. Here, we used substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) to provide new evidence for a centrally located gate that moves during channel activation. In the closed state, three cysteine substitutions, located on the extracellular side of M2, were modified by methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents. In contrast, 13 cysteine substitutions were modified in the open state with MTS reagents. The pattern of inhibition (every three to four substitutions) was consistent with an alpha helical structure for the middle and cytoplasmic segments of the M2 transmembrane domain. Unexpectedly, open-state modification of two amino acids in the center of M2 with three different MTS reagents prevented channels from fully closing in the absence of neurotransmitter. Our results are consistent with a model in which the central region of the M2 transmembrane domain is inaccessible in the closed state and moves during channel activation.},

Pinpointing the amino acids forming the pH sensor domains of these proteins remains challenging for current experimental techniques. Combining molecular dynamics simulations and pKa predictions with in vitro transport assays, we have revealed the molecular basis of the pH dependence of the mitochondrial carrier mediating the exchanges of ADP3- and ATP 4- across the inner mitochondrial membrane. We have demonstrated that the transport activity of this mitochondrial carrier depends on the protonation state of both the substrate and a unique, highly conserved residue of the protein. The original strategy proposed here offers a convenient framework for identifying pH-sensitive residues in membrane proteins in such cases where one single amino acid is involved.

abstract = {All-atom explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations are used to pull with extremely large constant force (750-3000 pN) on three small proteins. The introduction of a nondimensional timescale permits direct comparison of unfolding across all forces. A crossover force of approximately 1100 pN divides unfolding dynamics into two regimes. At higher forces, residues sequentially unfold from the pulling end while maintaining the remainder of the protein force-free. Measurements of hydrodynamic viscous stresses are made easy by the high speeds of unfolding. Using an exact low-Reynolds-number scaling, these measurements can be extrapolated to provide, for the first time, an estimate of the hydrodynamic force on low-force unfolding. Below 1100 pN, but surprisingly still at extremely large applied force, intermediate states and cooperative unfoldings as seen at much lower forces are observed. The force-insensitive persistence of these structures indicates that decomposition into unfolded fragments requires a large fluctuation. This finding suggests how proteins are constructed to resist transient high force. The progression of [Formula: see text] helix and [Formula: see text] sheet unfolding is also found to be insensitive to force. The force-insensitivity of key aspects of unfolding opens the possibility that numerical simulations can be accelerated by high applied force while still maintaining critical features of unfolding.},

abstract = {It has been traditionally difficult to measure the thermodynamic stability of membrane proteins because fully reversible protocols for complete folding these proteins were not available. Knowledge of the thermodynamic stability of membrane proteins is desirable not only from a fundamental theoretical standpoint, but is also of enormous practical interest for the rational design of membrane proteins and for optimizing conditions for their structure determination by crystallography or NMR. Here, we describe the design of a fully reversible system to study equilibrium folding of the outer membrane protein A from Escherichia coli in lipid bilayers. Folding is shown to be two-state under appropriate conditions permitting data analysis with a classical folding model developed for soluble proteins. The resulting free energy and m value, i.e., a measure of cooperativity, of unfolding are DeltaG(u,H2O)(o)=3.4 kcal/mol and m = 1.1 kcal/mol M(-1), respectively, in a reference bilayer composed of palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (C(16:0)C(18:1)PC) and palmitoyloleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (C(16:0)C(18:1)PG). These values are strong functions of the lipid bilayer environment. By systematic variation of lipid headgroup and chain composition, we show that elastic bilayer forces such as curvature stress and hydrophobic mismatch modulate the free energy and cooperativity of folding of this and perhaps many other membrane proteins.},

abstract = {The translocation of nucleotide molecules across biological and synthetic nanopores has attracted attention as a next generation technique for sequencing DNA. Computer simulations have the ability to provide atomistic-level insight into important states and processes, delivering a means to develop a fundamental understanding of the translocation event, for example, by extracting the free energy of the process. Even with current supercomputing facilities, the simulation of many-atom systems in fine detail is limited to shorter timescales than the real events they attempt to recreate. This imposes the need for enhanced simulation techniques that expand the scope of investigation in a given timeframe. There are numerous free energy calculation and translocation methodologies available, and it is by no means clear which method is best applied to a particular problem. This article explores the use of two popular free energy calculation methodologies in a nucleotide-nanopore translocation system, using the $\alpha$-hemolysin nanopore. The first uses constant velocity-steered molecular dynamics (cv-SMD) in conjunction with Jarzynski's equality. The second applies an adaptive biasing force (ABF), which has not previously been applied to the nucleotide-nanpore system. The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive comparison of these methodologies, allowing for a detailed comparative assessment of the scientific merits, the computational cost, and the statistical quality of the data obtained from each technique. We find that the ABF method produces results that are closer to experimental measurements than those from cv-SMD, whereas the net errors are smaller for the same computational cost.},

abstract = {Crystal structures of LeuT, a bacterial homologue of mammalian neurotransmitter transporters, show a molecule of bound substrate that is essentially exposed to the extracellular space but occluded from the cytoplasm. Thus, there must exist an alternate conformation for LeuT in which the substrate is accessible to the cytoplasm and a corresponding mechanism that switches accessibility from one side of the membrane to the other. Here, we identify the cytoplasmic accessibility pathway of the alternate conformation in a mammalian serotonin transporter (SERT) (a member of the same transporter family as LeuT). We also propose a model for the cytoplasmic-facing state that exploits the internal pseudosymmetry observed in the crystal structure. LeuT contains two structurally similar repeats (TMs1-5 and TMs 6-10) that are inverted with respect to the plane of the membrane. The conformational differences between them result in the formation of the extracellular pathway. Our model for the cytoplasm-facing state exchanges the conformations of the two repeats and thus exposes the substrate and ion-binding sites to the cytoplasm. The conformational change that connects the two states primarily involves the tilting of a 4-helix bundle composed of transmembrane helices 1, 2, 6, and 7. Switching the tilt angle of this bundle is essentially equivalent to switching the conformation of the two repeats. Extensive mutagenesis of SERT and accessibility measurements, using cysteine reagents, are accommodated by our model. These observations may be of relevance to other transporter families, many of which contain internal inverted repeats.},

Conventional EP delivers DNA, proteins, small drugs, and fluorescent indicators across the plasma membrane (PM) and causes moderate levels of phosphatidylserine (PS) translocation at the PM. We hypothesize that supra-EP is central to intracellular effects such as apoptosis induction and higher levels of PS translocation. Our cell system model has 20,000 interconnected local models for small areas of the PM and organelle membranes, small regions of aqueous media, appropriate resting potentials, and the asymptotic EP model. Conventional EP primarily affects the PM, but with a hint of endoplasmic reticulum involvement. Supra-EP can involve all of a cell's membrane at the largest fields. Conventional EP fields tend to go around cells, but supra-EP fields go through cells, extensively penetrating organelles. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The hydrolytic center, 20 angstroms above the membrane, is coupled to the gate formed by the conserved Asp(243), Glu(246), and Lys(707) by an unusual "coupling funnel" of six $\alpha$ helices. Comparison with our 4.0-angstrom resolution structure of the product complex suggests that helix 12 slides down upon substrate binding to open the gate by a simple binding-change mechanism. Below the gate, four helices form the exit channel. Superimposing helices 3 to 6, 9 to 12, and 13 to 16 suggests that M-PPases arose through gene triplication.},

Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to study the influence of external electric fields on a mixed gramicidin/phospholipid bilayer system. At high field strengths, formation of membrane electropores occurred both close and distal to the gramicidin. Gramicidin was found to stabilize the membrane adjacent to the protein but also at larger distances of up to 2-3 nm. As a result, membrane pore formation was found to be significantly suppressed for the mixed gramicidin/DMPC system. Moderate field strengths only weakly affected the structure and dynamics of the gramicidin. Spontaneous potassium passage events in external electric fields were observed for both the head-to-head helical conformation as well as for the double helical conformation of gramicidin A. The double-helical conformation was found to facilitate ion passage compared to the head-to-head helical dimer. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The minimal proton pumping machinery of the Arabidopsis thaliana P-type plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase isoform 2 (AHA2) consists of an aspartate residue serving as key proton donor/acceptor (Asp-684) and an arginine residue controlling the pKa of the aspartate. However, other important aspects of the proton transport mechanism such as gating, and the ability to occlude protons, are still unclear. An asparagine residue (Asn-106) in transmembrane segment 2 of AHA2 is conserved in all P-type plasma membrane H(+)-ATPases. In the crystal structure of the plant plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase, this residue is located in the putative ligand entrance pathway, in close proximity to the central proton donor/acceptor Asp-684. Substitution of Asn-106 resulted in mutant enzymes with significantly reduced ability to transport protons against a membrane potential. Sensitivity toward orthovanadate was increased when Asn-106 was substituted with an aspartate residue, but decreased in mutants with alanine, lysine, glutamine, or threonine replacement of Asn-106. The apparent proton affinity was decreased for all mutants, most likely due to a perturbation of the local environment of Asp-684. Altogether, our results demonstrate that Asn-106 is important for closure of the proton entrance pathway prior to proton translocation across the membrane.},

The structure of a bacterial proton-gated homolog has been established in its open and locally closed conformations at acidic pH. Here we report its crystal structure at neutral pH, thereby providing the X-ray structures of the two end-points of the gating mechanism in the same pentameric ligand-gated ion channel. The large structural variability in the neutral pH structure observed in the four copies of the pentamer present in the asymmetric unit has been used to analyze the intrinsic fluctuations in this state, which are found to prefigure the transition to the open state. In the extracellular domain (ECD), a marked quaternary change is observed, involving both a twist and a blooming motion, and the pore in the transmembrane domain (TMD) is closed by an upper bend of helix M2 (as in locally closed form) and a kink of helix M1, both helices no longer interacting across adjacent subunits. On the tertiary level, detachment of inner and outer $\beta$ sheets in the ECD reshapes two essential cavities at the ECD-ECD and ECD-TMD interfaces. The first one is the ligand-binding cavity; the other is close to a known divalent cation binding site in other pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. In addition, a different crystal form reveals that the locally closed and open conformations coexist as discrete ones at acidic pH. These structural results, together with site-directed mutagenesis, physiological recordings, and coarse-grained modeling, have been integrated to propose a model of the gating transition pathway.},

The PL(-)-binding site and mechanism are yet to be elucidated. Here we report docking simulations that identify a putative PL(-)-binding site, adjacent to the PIP2-binding site, generated by two lysine residues from neighbouring subunits. When either lysine is mutated to cysteine (K64C and K219C), channel activity is significantly decreased in cells and in reconstituted liposomes. Directly tethering K64C to the membrane by modification with decyl-MTS generates high PIP2 sensitivity in liposomes, even in the complete absence of PL(-)s. The results provide a coherent molecular mechanism whereby PL(-) interaction with a discrete binding site results in a conformational change that stabilizes the high-affinity PIP2 activatory site.},

abstract = {Protein-protein pore interaction is a fundamental and ubiquitous process in biology and medical biotechnology. Here, we employed high-resolution time-resolved single-channel electrical recording along with protein engineering to examine a protein-protein pore interaction at single-molecule resolution. The pore was formed by Staphylococcus aureus alpha-hemolysin (alphaHL) protein and contained electrostatic traps formed by rings of seven aspartic acid residues placed at two different positions within the pore lumen. The protein analytes were positively charged presequences (pb2) of varying length fused to the small ribonuclease barnase (Ba). The presence of the electrostatic traps greatly enhanced the interaction of the pb2-Ba protein with the alphaHL protein pore. This study demonstrates the high sensitivity of the nanopore technique to an array of factors that govern the protein-protein pore interaction, including the length of the pb2 presequence, the position of the electrostatic traps within the pore lumen, the ionic strength of the aqueous phase, and the transmembrane potential. Alterations in the functional properties of the pb2-Ba protein and the alphaHL protein pore and systematic changes of the experimental parameters revealed the balance between forces driving the pb2-Ba protein into the pore and forces driving it out.},

abstract = {The electroporation process in response to a high-intensity, ultrashort (∼ns) electric pulse is probed based on molecular-dynamics simulations and shown to be a very rapid, twofold process. The electric driving force produces a Maxwell stress at the membrane and works to rearrange lipid dipoles and cause openings. However, water entry, which is essential for useful transport, is facilitated by electrowetting, which is an important component of the overall process. The molecular system can thus function as an electrically driven hydrophobic toggle switch that changes the water permeability. Furthermore, our results show that once they are fully formed, the nanopores do not close rapidly after cessation of the external electric field, in keeping with recent experiments. Finally, it is suggested that multiple pore formation in close proximity, as in situations involving high driving electric fields, is likely to be a rapid sequential process.},

abstract = {An important feature of ligand-gated ion channels is their exquisite ability to discriminate between ions. Still, little is known about the mechanisms underlying, or structural determinates of, this ability. We examined the structural elements underlying the ionic selectivity of rho1 GABA receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes and human embryonic kidney cells using site-directed mutagenesis and two-electrode voltage-clamp or patch-clamp techniques. The wild-type GABA receptor was chloride selective, with a small but significant permeability to potassium (PNa+ : PK+ : PCl- = 0 : 0.03 :1). Mutation of an alanine to glutamate at position 291 (thought to be located at the intracellular end of the second transmembrane domain), formed a channel that exhibited little discrimination among ions (0.70:0.87:1), while deletion of a neighbouring proline (290) was chloride selective, but had elevated cation permeabilities compared to the wild-type channel (0.12 : 0.14 : 1). Together, the two mutations (DeltaP290/A291E) caused a reversal of selectivity (2.72 : 3.59 : 1). We also examined the effects of neutralizing and reversing the charge of the adjacent, and highly conserved, arginine. Mutation of the neighbouring arginine to glutamate (R292E) increased the cation permeability similar to the DeltaP290/A291E double mutant (2.4 : 3.0 : 1), whereas neutral mutations at this position (R292M or R292C) retained chloride selectivity (0 : 0.11 : 1.0 and 0 : 0.14 : 1.0, respectively). Our experiments suggest that the effective charge near the presumed intracellular mouth of the pore is critical for ionic selectivity.},

This modification overcomes the otherwise inherent energetic mismatch to the hydrophobic environment of the membrane.

abstract = {The transport of biomolecules across cell boundaries is central to cellular function. While structures of many membrane channels are known, the permeation mechanism is known only for a select few. Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computational method that can provide an accurate description of permeation events at the atomic level, which is required for understanding the transport mechanism. However, due to the relatively short time scales accessible to this method, it is of limited utility. Here, we present a method for all-atom simulation of electric field-driven transport of large solutes through membrane channels, which in tens of nanoseconds can provide a realistic account of a permeation event that would require a millisecond simulation using conventional MD. In this method, the average distribution of the electrostatic potential in a membrane channel under a transmembrane bias of interest is determined first from an all-atom MD simulation. This electrostatic potential, defined on a grid, is subsequently applied to a charged solute to steer its permeation through the membrane channel. We apply this method to investigate permeation of DNA strands, DNA hairpins, and alpha-helical peptides through alpha-hemolysin. To test the accuracy of the method, we computed the relative permeation rates of DNA strands having different sequences and global orientations. The results of the G-SMD simulations were found to be in good agreement in experiment.},

abstract = {Cys-loop receptors constitute a superfamily of ion channels gated by ligands such as acetylcholine, serotonin, glycine, and $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid. All of these receptors are thought to share structural characteristics, but due to high sequence variation and limited structure availability, our knowledge about allosteric binding sites is still limited. These sites are frequent targets of anesthetic and alcohol molecules, and are of high pharmacological importance. We used molecular simulations to study ethanol binding and equilibrium exchange for the homomeric $\alpha$1 glycine receptor (GlyR$\alpha$1), modeled on the structure of the Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand-gated channel. Ethanol has a well-known potentiating effect and can be used in high concentrations. By performing two microsecond-scale simulations of GlyR with/without ethanol, we were able to observe spontaneous binding in cavities and equilibrium ligand exchange. Of interest, it appears that there are ethanol-binding sites both between and within the GlyR transmembrane subunits, with the intersubunit site having the highest occupancy and slowest exchange (∼200 ns). This model site involves several residues that were previously identified via mutations as being crucial for potentiation. Finally, ethanol appears to stabilize the GlyR model built on a presumably open form of the ligand-gated channel. This stabilization could help explain the effects of allosteric ligand binding in Cys-loop receptors. © 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

However, we found that EPs of nanosecond duration (nsEPs) trigger formation of voltage-sensitive and inward-rectifying membrane pores. NsEP-treated cells remain mostly impermeable to propidium, suggesting that the maximum pore size is ???1 nm. The ion-channel-like properties of nsEP-opened nanopores vanish if they break into larger, propidium-permeable "conventional" pores. However, nanopores can be stable for many minutes and significantly impact cell electrolyte and water balance. Multiple nsEPs cause fast cell swelling and blebbing, whereas opening of larger pores with digitonin abolishes swelling and causes blebs to implode. The lipid nature of nsEP-opened nanopores is confirmed by fast externalization of phosphatidylserine residues. Nanopores constitute a previously unexplored ion transport pathway that supplements classic ion channels but is distinctly different from them. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Biogenesis of $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins is a complex, multistep, and as yet incompletely characterized process. The bacterial porin family is perhaps the best-studied protein family among $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins that allows diffusion of small solutes across the bacterial outer membrane. In this study, we have identified residues that contribute significantly to the protein-protein interaction (PPI) interface between the chains of outer membrane protein F (OmpF), a trimeric porin, using an empirical energy function in conjunction with an evolutionary analysis. By replacing these residues through site-directed mutagenesis either with energetically favorable residues or substitutions that do not occur in natural bacterial outer membrane proteins, we succeeded in engineering OmpF mutants with dimeric and monomeric oligomerization states instead of a trimeric oligomerization state. Moreover, our results suggest that the oligomerization of OmpF proceeds through a series of interactions involving two distinct regions of the extensive PPI interface: two monomers interact to form a dimer through the PPI interface near G19. This dimer then interacts with another monomer through the PPI interface near G135 to form a trimer. We have found that perturbing the PPI interface near G19 results in the formation of the monomeric OmpF only. Thermal denaturation of the designed dimeric OmpF mutant suggests that oligomer dissociation can be separated from the process of protein unfolding. Furthermore, the conserved site near G57 and G59 is important for the PPI interface and might provide the essential scaffold for PPIs.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to explore the interactions of two PI(3)P-binding domains with their PI ligands and with a phospholipid bilayer. Three simulations each of the EEA1-FYVE domain and the p40(phox)-PX domain have been compared: with the protein in an apo state, with a bound Ins(1,3)P(2) molecule, and bound to a PI(3)P molecule embedded in a lipid bilayer. Two main questions were addressed in analysis of the simulations: (i) the location of these domains relative to the lipid bilayer and (ii) their interactions with the lipids, both specific interactions via bound PI(3)P and nonspecific interactions with bilayer phospholipids. Both domains underwent a decrease in dynamic flexibility on binding to the ligand and to the membrane, this being more pronounced for the FYVE domain. Compared to their starting locations [docked to a membrane-inserted PI(3)P molecule], each of the domains penetrated more deeply into the lipid bilayer. For FYVE, nonspecific protein-lipid interactions were formed mainly by the N-terminal hydrophobic region of the protein. For PX, both the alpha1-alpha2 and the beta1-beta2 regions penetrated the bilayer. There appeared to be more marked dynamic fluctuations in hydrogen bonds between basic side chains and PI(3)P for FYVE than for PX, but for both domains, such interactions were maintained throughout the simulations. The simulations agree well with available biophysical data, suggesting this computational method may be used to predict protein-bilayer interactions for other PI-binding proteins.},

abstract = {Graphene is an ideal thin membrane substrate for creating molecule-scale devices. Here we demonstrate a scalable method for creating extremely small structures in graphene with atomic precision. It consists of inducing defect nucleation centers with energetic ions, followed by edge-selective electron recoil sputtering. As a first application, we create graphene nanopores with radii as small as 3 Å, which corresponds to 10 atoms removed. We observe carbon atom removal from the nanopore edge in situ using an aberration-corrected electron microscope, measure the cross-section for the process, and obtain a mean edge atom displacement energy of 14.1 ± 0.1 eV. This approach does not require focused beams and allows scalable production of single nanopores and arrays of monodisperse nanopores for atomic-scale selectively permeable membranes.},

abstract = {5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptors are cation-selective transmitter-gated ion channels of the Cys-loop superfamily. The single-channel conductance of human recombinant 5-HT3 receptors assembled as homomers of 5-HT3A subunits, or heteromers of 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits, are markedly different, being 0.4 pS (refs 6, 9) and 16 pS (ref. 7), respectively. Paradoxically, the channel-lining M2 domain of the 5-HT3A subunit would be predicted to promote cation conduction, whereas that of the 5-HT3B subunit would not. Here we describe a determinant of single-channel conductance that can explain these observations. By constructing chimaeric 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits we identified a region (the 'HA-stretch') within the large cytoplasmic loop of the receptor that markedly influences channel conductance. Replacement of three arginine residues unique to the HA-stretch of the 5-HT3A subunit by their 5-HT3B subunit counterparts increased single-channel conductance 28-fold. Significantly, ultrastructural studies of the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor indicate that the key residues might frame narrow openings that contribute to the permeation pathway. Our findings solve the conundrum of the anomalously low conductance of homomeric 5-HT3A receptors and indicate an important function for the HA-stretch in Cys-loop transmitter-gated ion channels.},

@article{Beckstein2004c,
abstract = {A hydrophobic constriction site can act as an efficient barrier to ion and water permeation if its diameter is less than the diameter of an ion's first hydration shell. This hydrophobic gating mechanism is thought to operate in a number of ion channels, e.g. the nicotinic receptor, bacterial mechanosensitive channels (MscL and MscS) and perhaps in some potassium channels (e.g. KcsA, MthK and KvAP). Simplified pore models allow one to investigate the primary characteristics of a conduction pathway, namely its geometry (shape, pore length, and radius), the chemical character of the pore wall surface, and its local flexibility and surface roughness. Our extended (about 0.1 micros) molecular dynamic simulations show that a short hydrophobic pore is closed to water for radii smaller than 0.45 nm. By increasing the polarity of the pore wall (and thus reducing its hydrophobicity) the transition radius can be decreased until for hydrophilic pores liquid water is stable down to a radius comparable to a water molecule's radius. Ions behave similarly but the transition from conducting to non-conducting pores is even steeper and occurs at a radius of 0.65 nm for hydrophobic pores. The presence of water vapour in a constriction zone indicates a barrier for ion permeation. A thermodynamic model can explain the behaviour of water in nanopores in terms of the surface tensions, which leads to a simple measure of 'hydrophobicity' in this context. Furthermore, increased local flexibility decreases the permeability of polar species. An increase in temperature has the same effect, and we hypothesize that both effects can be explained by a decrease in the effective solvent-surface attraction which in turn leads to an increase in the solvent-wall surface free energy.},

@article{Ziegler2008,
abstract = {The cell wall of Corynebacterium glutamicum contains a mycolic acid layer, which is a protective nonpolar barrier similar to the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The exchange of material across this barrier requires porins. Porin B (PorB) is one of them. Recombinant PorB has been produced in Escherichia coli, purified, crystallized and analyzed by X-ray diffraction, yielding 16 independent molecular structures in four different crystal forms at resolutions up to 1.8 A. All 16 molecules have the same globular core, which consists of 70 residues forming four alpha-helices tied together by a disulfide bridge. The 16 structures vary greatly with respect to the 29 residues in the N- and C-terminal extensions. Since corynebacteria belong to the group of mycolata that includes some prominent human pathogens, the observed structure may be of medical relevance. Due to the clearly established solid structure of the core, the native porin has to be oligomeric, and the reported structure is one of the subunits. An alpha-helical porin in a bacterial outer envelope is surprising because all presently known structures of such porins consist of beta-barrels. Since none of the four crystal packing arrangements was compatible with an oligomeric membrane channel, we constructed a model of such an oligomer that was consistent with all available data of native PorB. The proposed model is based on the required polar interior and nonpolar exterior of the porin, on a recurring crystal packing contact around a 2-fold axis, on the assumption of a simple C(n) symmetry (a symmetric arrangement around an n-fold axis), on the experimentally established electric conductivity and anion selectivity and on the generally observed shape of porin channels.},

Here we report that plasma-modified ultralong carbon nanotubes exhibit ultrahigh specific adsorption capacity for salt (exceeding 400% by weight) that is two orders of magnitude higher than that found in the current state-of-the-art activated carbon-based water treatment systems. We exploit this adsorption capacity in ultralong carbon nanotube-based membranes that can remove salt, as well as organic and metal contaminants. These ultralong carbon nanotube-based membranes may lead to next-generation rechargeable, point-of-use potable water purification appliances with superior desalination, disinfection and filtration properties.},

abstract = {In free energy calculations based on thermodynamic integration, it is necessary to compute the derivatives of the free energy as a function of one (scalar case) or several (vector case) order parameters. We derive in a compact way a general formulation for evaluating these derivatives as the average of a mean force acting on the order parameters, which involves first derivatives with respect to both Cartesian coordinates and time. This is in contrast with the previously derived formulas, which require first and second derivatives of the order parameter with respect to Cartesian coordinates. As illustrated in a concrete example, the main advantage of this new formulation is the simplicity of its use, especially for complicated order parameters. It is also straightforward to implement in a molecular dynamics code, as can be seen from the pseudocode given at the end. We further discuss how the approach based on time derivatives can be combined with the adaptive biasing force method, an enhanced sampling technique that rapidly yields uniform sampling of the order parameters, and by doing so greatly improves the efficiency of free energy calculations. Using the backbone dihedral angles Phi and Psi in N-acetylalanyl-N'-methylamide as a numerical example, we present a technique to reconstruct the free energy from its derivatives, a calculation that presents some difficulties in the vector case because of the statistical errors affecting the derivatives.},

abstract = {The nonsense mutations R518X-KCNQ1 and Q530X-KCNQ1 cause LQT1 (long-QT syndrome type 1) and result in a complete loss of IKs channel function. In the present study we attempted to rescue the function of these mutants, in HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells, by promoting readthrough of their PTCs (premature termination codons) using the pharmacological agents G-418, gentamicin and PTC124. Gentamicin and G-418 acted to promote full-length channel protein expression from R518X at 100 $\mu$M and from Q530X at 1 mM. In contrast, PTC124 did not, at any dose tested, induce readthrough of either mutant. G-418 (1 mM) treatment also acted to significantly (P<0.05) increase current density and peak-tail current density, at +80 mV for R518X, but not Q530X, to 58±11% and 82±17% of the wild-type level respectively. However, the biophysical properties of the currents produced from R518X, while similar, were not identical with wild-type as the voltage-dependence of activation was significantly (P<0.05) shifted by +25 mV. Overall, these findings indicate that although functional rescue of LQT1 nonsense mutations is possible, it is dependent on the degree of readthrough achieved and the effect on channel function of the amino acid substituted for the PTC. Such considerations will determine the success of future therapies.},

Boron nitride nanotubes have shown superior water flow properties compared to carbon nanotubes, and are thus expected to provide a more efficient water purification device. Using molecular dynamics simulations it is shown that a (5, 5) boron nitride nanotube embedded in a silicon nitride membrane can, in principle, obtain 100% salt rejection at concentrations as high as 1 M owing to a high energy barrier while still allowing water molecules to flow at a rate as high as 10.7 water molecules per nanosecond (or 0.9268 L m(-2) h(-1)). Furthermore, ions continue to be rejected under the influence of high hydrostatic pressures up to 612 MPa. When the nanotube radius is increased to 4.14 A the tube becomes cation-selective, and at 5.52 A the tube becomes anion-selective.},

abstract = {Nanopore technology for DNA sequencing is constantly being refined and improved. In strand sequencing a single strand of DNA is fed through a nanopore and subsequent fluctuations in the current are measured. A major hurdle is that the DNA is translocated through the pore at a rate that is too fast for the current measurement systems. An alternative approach is “exonuclease sequencing”, in which an exonuclease is attached to the nanopore that is able to process the strand, cleaving off one base at a time. The bases then flow through the nanopore and the current is measured. This method has the advantage of potentially solving the translocation rate problem, as the speed is controlled by the exonuclease. Here we consider the practical details of exonuclease attachment to the protein alpha hemolysin. We employ molecular dynamics simulations to determine the ideal (a) distance from alpha-hemolysin, and (b) the orientation of the monophosphate nucleotides upon release from the exonuclease such that they will enter the protein. Our results indicate an almost linear decrease in the probability of entry into the protein with increasing distance of nucleotide release. The nucleotide orientation is less significant for entry into the protein.},

abstract = {FhuA, the receptor for ferrichrome-iron in Escherichia coli, is a member of a family of integral outer membrane proteins, which, together with the energy-transducing protein TonB, mediate the active transport of ferric siderophores across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The three-dimensional structure of FhuA is presented here in two conformations: with and without ferrichrome-iron at resolutions of 2.7 and 2.5 angstroms, respectively. FhuA is a beta barrel composed of 22 antiparallel beta strands. In contrast to the typical trimeric arrangement found in porins, FhuA is monomeric. Located within the beta barrel is a structurally distinct domain, the "cork," which mainly consists of a four-stranded beta sheet and four short alpha helices. A single lipopolysaccharide molecule is noncovalently associated with the membrane-embedded region of the protein. Upon binding of ferrichrome-iron, conformational changes are transduced to the periplasmic pocket of FhuA, signaling the ligand-loaded status of the receptor. Sequence homologies and mutagenesis data are used to propose a structural mechanism for TonB-dependent siderophore-mediated transport across the outer membrane.},

abstract = {Gene delivery to skeletal muscle is a promising strategy for the treatment of muscle disorders and for the systemic secretion of therapeutic proteins. However, present DNA delivery technologies have to be improved with regard to both the level of expression and interindividual variability. We report very efficient plasmid DNA transfer in muscle fibers by using square-wave electric pulses of low field strength (less than 300 V/cm) and of long duration (more than 1 ms). Contrary to the electropermeabilization-induced uptake of small molecules into muscle fibers, plasmid DNA has to be present in the tissue during the electric pulses, suggesting a direct effect of the electric field on DNA during electrotransfer. This i.m. electrotransfer method increases reporter and therapeutic gene expression by several orders of magnitude in various muscles in mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey. Moreover, i.m. electrotransfer strongly decreases variability. Stability of expression was observed for at least 9 months. With a pCMV-FGF1 plasmid coding for fibroblast growth factor 1, this protein was immunodetected in the majority of muscle fibers subjected to the electric pulses. DNA electrotransfer in muscle may have broad applications in gene therapy and in physiological, pharmacological, and developmental studies.},

abstract = {Transmembrane beta-barrels, first observed in bacterial porins, are possible models for a number of membrane channels. Restrained molecular dynamics simulations based on idealized C alpha beta templates have been used to generate models of such beta-barrels. Model beta-barrels have been analyzed in terms of their conformational, energetic, and pore properties. Model beta-barrels formed by N = 4, 8, 12 and 16 anti-parallel Ala10 strands have been developed. For each N, beta-barrels with shear numbers S = N to 2N have been modeled. In all beta-barrel models the constituent beta-strands adopt a pronounced right-handed twist. Interstrand interactions are of approximately equal stability for all models with N > or = 8, whereas such interactions are weaker for the N = 4 beta-barrels. In N = 4 beta-barrels the pore is too narrow (minimum radius approximately 0.6 A) to allow ion permeation. For N > or = 8, the pore radius depends on both N and S; for a given value of N an increase in S from N to 2N is predicted to result in an approximately threefold increase in pore conductance. Calculated maximal conductances for the beta-barrel models are compared with experimental values for porins and for K+ channels.},

Our systems--essentially stacks of peptide rings--display good channel-mediated ion-transport activity with rates exceeding 10(7) ions s-1, rivalling the performance of many naturally occurring counterparts.

Overall, this provides a method for generating an accurate and well equilibrated membrane protein/lipid complex. We exemplify the protocol using the acid-sensing/amiloride-sensitive ion channel protein (ASIC) channel protein, a trimeric integral membrane protein.

abstract = {The porins PhoE and OmpF form anion and cation-selective pores, respectively, in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. Each monomer of these trimeric proteins consists of a 16-stranded beta-barrel, which contains a constriction at half the height of the channel. The functional significance of a transverse electrical field that is formed by charged amino acid residues within the constriction zone was investigated. For this purpose, the PhoE residues R37, R75, K18 and E110 were substituted by neutral amino acids. The mutant pores allowed an increased permeation of beta-lactam antibiotics across the outer membrane in vivo, although the single channel conductance, measured in planar lipid bilayers, was not increased or even slightly decreased. Replacement of the positively charged residues resulted in a decreased voltage sensitivity, whereas the substitution of a negatively charged residue resulted in an increased voltage sensitivity. Similar substitutions in OmpF caused the opposite effects, i.e. the substitution of positive and negative charges resulted in increased and decreased voltage sensitivity, respectively. Together, the results suggest that opposite charges, i.e. positive charges in anion-selective and negative charges in cation-selective porins, act as sensors for voltage gating.},

It is demonstrated that, as in the aquaporins, asymmetrically positioned charges cannot generate robust unidirectional water flow in the CNT. Thermal fluctuation in bulk water competes with charge affinity to steer the water transport, resulting in nonmonotonic flow with intermittent reversal of transport direction. The energetic analysis suggests that the water-water interaction, determined by dipole orientation configuration, influences the transport rate significantly. These findings can provide correct biomimic understanding of water transport properties and will benefit the design of efficient functional nanofluidic devices.},

When a molecule is driven through a nanopore by an externally applied electric field, it causes a characteristic temporary change in the trans-pore current. Here, we examine the translocation of DNA with discrete patches of the DNA-repair protein RecA attached along its length. Using the fact that RecA-coated DNA and bare DNA yield very different current-blockade signatures, we demonstrate that it is possible to map the locations of the proteins along the length of a single molecule using a solid-state nanopore. This is achieved at high speed and without any staining. We currently obtain a spatial resolution of about 8 nm, or 5 RecA proteins binding to 15 base pairs of DNA, and we discuss possible extensions to single protein resolution. The results are a crucial first step toward genomic screening, as they demonstrate the feasibility of reading off information along DNA at high resolution with a solid-state nanopore.},

abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations are used investigate the properties of the free energy barrier associated with polymer translocation through a nanopore. We employ a multiple-histogram method to calculate the variation of the free energy with Q, a coordinate used to quantify the degree of translocation. The system is modeled as a flexible hard-sphere chain that translocates through a cylindrical hole in a hard flat wall. Some calculations were carried out for nanopores connected to a spherical cavity at one or both ends. Attractive monomer-nanopore interactions and a linear driving force through the nanopore were also included in some calculations. The properties of the free energy functions for short polymers were studied upon variation in all of the key system parameters, including polymer length, the nanopore dimensions, the strengths of the attractive, and driving force interactions. The results were analyzed using a simple theoretical model, whose only free parameter is the confinement free energy per link for monomers inside the nanopore. Generally, the results are in excellent quantitative agreement with the model. One notable feature of the free energy functions is the presence of oscillations whose amplitude increases with decreasing pore radius. These oscillations are due to the nature of the variation with Q of the orientational entropy of bonds at the two edges of the pore. A simple model was constructed to account for dependence of the oscillation amplitude and period on the system parameters. We propose that the theoretical models developed here can be used to make quantitatively accurate predictions of translocation free energy functions for very long polymers using simulation data acquired for short polymers.},

abstract = {Membrane permeability barriers are among the factors contributing to the intrinsic resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. We have been able to resolve single ampicillin molecules moving through a channel of the general bacterial porin, OmpF (outer membrane protein F), believed to be the principal pathway for the beta-lactam antibiotics. With ion channel reconstitution and high-resolution conductance recording, we find that ampicillin and several other efficient penicillins and cephalosporins strongly interact with the residues of the constriction zone of the OmpF channel. Therefore, we hypothesize that, in analogy to substrate-specific channels that evolved to bind certain metabolite molecules, antibiotics have "evolved" to be channel-specific. Molecular modeling suggests that the charge distribution of the ampicillin molecule complements the charge distribution at the narrowest part of the bacterial porin. Interaction of these charges creates a region of attraction inside the channel that facilitates drug translocation through the constriction zone and results in higher permeability rates.},

abstract = {Staphylococcal $\gamma$-hemolysin is a bicomponent pore-forming toxin composed of LukF and Hlg2. These proteins are expressed as water-soluble monomers and then assemble into the oligomeric pore form on the target cell. Here, we report the crystal structure of the octameric pore form of $\gamma$-hemolysin at 2.5 \AA resolution, which is the first high-resolution structure of a $\beta$-barrel transmembrane protein composed of two proteins reported to date. The octameric assembly consists of four molecules of LukF and Hlg2 located alternately in a circular pattern, which explains the biochemical data accumulated over the past two decades. The structure, in combination with the monomeric forms, demonstrates the elaborate molecular machinery involved in pore formation by two different molecules, in which interprotomer electrostatic interactions using loops connecting $\beta$2 and $\beta$3 (loop A: Asp43-Lys48 of LukF and Lys37-Lys43 of Hlg2) play pivotal roles as the structural determinants for assembly through unwinding of the N-terminal $\beta$-strands (amino-latch) of the adjacent protomer, releasing the transmembrane stem domain folded into a $\beta$-sheet in the monomer (prestem), and interaction with the adjacent protomer.},

CHIP28 is an abundant integral membrane protein in RBCs and renal tubules, and Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with CHIP28 RNA exhibit high osmotic water permeability, Pf [Preston et al. (1992) Science 256, 385-387]. Purified CHIP28 from human RBCs was reconstituted into proteoliposomes in order to establish if CHIP28 is itself the functional unit of water channels and to characterize its physiological behavior. CHIP28 proteoliposomes exhibit Pf which is up to 50-fold above that of control liposomes, but permeability to urea and protons is not increased. Like intact RBC, the Pf of CHIP28 proteoliposomes is reversibly inhibited by mercurial sulfhydryl reagents and exhibits a low Arrhenius activation energy. The magnitude of CHIP28-mediated water flux (11.7 x 10(-14) cm3/s per CHIP28) corresponds to the known Pf of intact RBCs. These results demonstrate that CHIP28 protein functions as a molecular water channel and also indicate that CHIP28 is responsible for most transmembrane water movement in RBCs.},

abstract = {A hydrophobic pore of subnanometer dimensions can appear impermeable to an ion even though its radius is still much wider than that of the ion. Pores of molecular dimensions can be found, for instance, in carbon nanotubes, zeolites, or ion channel proteins. We quantify this barrier to ion permeation by calculating the potential of mean force from umbrella-sampled molecular dynamics simulations and compare them to continuum-electrostatic Poisson-Boltzmann calculations. The latter fail to describe the ion barrier because they do not account for the properties of water in the pore. The barrier originates from the energetic cost to desolvate the ion. Even in wide pores, which could accommodate an ion and its hydration shell, a barrier of several kT remains because the liquid water phase is not stable in the hydrophobic pore. Thus, the properties of the solvent play a crucial role in determining permeation properties of ions in confinement at the molecular scale.},

However, ionic current noise levels are several orders of magnitude larger than those for silicon nitride nanopores. These fluctuations are reduced with the atomic-layer deposition of 5 nm of titanium dioxide over the device. Unlike traditional solid-state nanopore materials that are insulating, graphene is an excellent electrical conductor. Use of graphene as a membrane material opens the door to a new class of nanopore devices in which electronic sensing and control are performed directly at the pore.},

abstract = {A set of 49 protein nanopore-lipid bilayer systems was explored by means of coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulations to study the interactions between nanopores and the lipid bilayers in which they are embedded. The seven nanopore species investigated represent the two main structural classes of membrane proteins (alpha-helical and beta-barrel), and the seven different bilayer systems range in thickness from approximately 28 to approximately 43 A. The study focuses on the local effects of hydrophobic mismatch between the nanopore and the lipid bilayer. The effects of nanopore insertion on lipid bilayer thickness, the dependence between hydrophobic thickness and the observed nanopore tilt angle, and the local distribution of lipid types around a nanopore in mixed-lipid bilayers are all analyzed. Different behavior for nanopores of similar hydrophobic length but different geometry is observed. The local lipid bilayer perturbation caused by the inserted nanopores suggests possible mechanisms for both lipid bilayer-induced protein sorting and protein-induced lipid sorting. A correlation between smaller lipid bilayer thickness (larger hydrophobic mismatch) and larger nanopore tilt angle is observed and, in the case of larger hydrophobic mismatches, the simulated tilt angle distribution seems to broaden. Furthermore, both nanopore size and key residue types (e.g., tryptophan) seem to influence the level of protein tilt, emphasizing the reciprocal nature of nanopore-lipid bilayer interactions.},

abstract = {Using ab initio hybrid density functional theory based calculations, we report here the electronic and geometric structure properties of three different types of single-walled zigzag silicon carbide nanotube simulated by finite clusters with dangling bonds saturated by hydrogen atoms. These three types differ in the spatial arrangements of Si and C atoms. Full geometry and spin optimizations have been performed without any symmetry constraints. A detailed comparison of the structures and stabilities of the three types of nanotube is presented. Our calculations show type 1 structures to be more stable than type 2 structures, consistent with another result found in the literature. The cohesive energies/atom of the newly proposed type 3 nanotubes lie in between type 1 and type 2. The dependence of the electronic band gaps on the respective tube diameters, energy density of states and dipole moments as well as Mulliken charge distributions have been investigated. For all types of nanotube, Si atoms moved outward of the tube axis making two concentric cylinders of Si and C atoms after relaxation, contrary to some published results in the literature for type 1 zigzag nanotubes. The band gaps for type 1 and type 2 nanotubes show an oscillatory pattern as the diameter increases. Unlike the other two types, the band gap for type 3 nanotubes decreases monotonically with increasing tube diameter. All the tubes studied here appear to have triplet ground states except for type 1 (3, 0). It is expected that these tubes with significant surface reconstructions, varieties of band gaps, and magnetic properties would have interesting and important applications in the field of band gap engineering and molecular electronics.},

abstract = {The drying of hydrophobic cavities is believed to play an important role in biophysical phenomena such as the folding of globular proteins, the opening and closing of ligand-gated ion channels, and ligand binding to hydrophobic pockets. We use forward flux sampling, a molecular simulation technique, to compute the rate of capillary evaporation of water confined between two hydrophobic surfaces separated by nanoscopic gaps, as a function of gap, surface size, and temperature. Over the range of conditions investigated (gaps between 9 and 14 Å and surface areas between 1 and 9 nm(2)), the free energy barrier to evaporation scales linearly with the gap between hydrophobic surfaces, suggesting that line tension makes the predominant contribution to the free energy barrier. The exponential dependence of the evaporation rate on the gap between confining surfaces causes a 10 order-of-magnitude decrease in the rate when the gap increases from 9 to 14 Å. The computed free energy barriers are of the order of 50 kT and are predominantly enthalpic. Evaporation rates per unit area are found to be two orders of magnitude faster in confinement by the larger (9 nm(2)) than by the smaller (1 nm(2)) surfaces considered here, at otherwise identical conditions. We show that this rate enhancement is a consequence of the dependence of hydrophobic hydration on the size of solvated objects. For sufficiently large surfaces, the critical nucleus for the evaporation process is a gap-spanning vapor tube.},

The APC35832 protein is a representative of large group of bacterial and archeal proteins entirely consisting of the Toprim (topoisomerase-primase) domain. This domain is found in the catalytic centers of many enzymes catalyzing phosphodiester bond formation or cleavage, but the function of small Toprim domain proteins remains unknown. Consistent with the sequence analysis, the APC35832 structure shows a conserved Toprim fold, with a central 4-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by four alpha-helixes. Comparison of the APC35832 structure with its closest structural homolog, the catalytic core of bacteriophage T7 primase, revealed structural conservation of a metal binding site and isothermal titration calorimetry indicates that APC35832 binds Mg2+ with a sub-millimolar dissociation constant (K(d)). The APC35832-Mg2+ complex structure was determined at 1.65 A and reveals the role of conserved acidic residues in Mg2+ ion coordination. The structural similarities to other Toprim domain containing proteins and potential function and substrates of APC35832 are discussed in this article.},

abstract = {A new, general formula that connects the derivatives of the free energy along the selected, generalized coordinates of the system with the instantaneous force acting on these coordinates is derived. The instantaneous force is defined as the force acting on the coordinate of interest so that when it is subtracted from the equations of motion the acceleration along this coordinate is zero. The formula applies to simulations in which the selected coordinates are either unconstrained or constrained to fixed values. It is shown that in the latter case the formula reduces to the expression previously derived by den Otter and Briels [Mol. Phys. 98, 773 (2000)]. If simulations are carried out without constraining the coordinates of interest, the formula leads to a new method for calculating the free energy changes along these coordinates. This method is tested in two examples — rotation around the C–C bond of 1,2-dichloroethane immersed in water and transfer of fluoromethane across the water-hexane interface. The calculated free energies are compared with those obtained by two commonly used methods. One of them relies on determining the probability density function of finding the system at different values of the selected coordinate and the other requires calculating the average force at discrete locations along this coordinate in a series of constrained simulations. The free energies calculated by these three methods are in excellent agreement. The relative advantages of each method are discussed.},

However, OMVs also benefit nonpathogenic species by delivering degradative enzymes to defend an ecological niche against competing bacterial species, and they can serve as an envelope stress response. Despite these important roles, very little is known about the mechanism of production of OMVs. Here we review the advantage of vesiculation, particularly in a nonpathogenic context, as well as the hurdles that have to be overcome in Gram-negative envelope architecture before a vesicle can form and bud. Lastly, we address the question of whether OMV production is a stochastic or regulated process.},

To reproduce the free energies of these chemical building blocks, the number of possible interaction levels of the coarse-grained sites has increased compared to those of the previous model. Application of the new model to lipid bilayers shows an improved behavior in terms of the stress profile across the bilayer and the tendency to form pores. An extension of the force field now also allows the simulation of planar (ring) compounds, including sterols. Application to a bilayer/cholesterol system at various concentrations shows the typical cholesterol condensation effect similar to that observed in all atom representations.},

Lipid A can be further modified in the outer membrane by two beta-barrel enzymes of unknown structure; namely, the Salmonella enterica 3'-acyloxyacyl hydrolase LpxR, and the Rhizobium leguminosarum oxidase LpxQ, which employs O(2) to convert the proximal glucosamine unit of lipid A into 2-aminogluconate. Structural biology now indicates how beta-barrel enzymes can function as sentinels that remain dormant when the outer membrane permeability barrier is intact. Host immune defenses and antibiotics that perturb this barrier can directly trigger beta-barrel enzymes in the outer membrane. The ensuing adaptive responses occur instantaneously and rapidly outpace other signal transduction mechanisms that similarly function to restore the outer membrane permeability barrier.},

To enable advances in the design of these energy materials, such that their operation, economy, efficiency and durability is at least comparable with fossil-fuel based alternatives, connections between the molecular-scale structure and function of these interfaces are needed. While it is experimentally challenging to resolve this interfacial structure, molecular simulation and computational chemistry can help bridge these gaps. In this Review, we summarise recent progress in the application of computational chemistry to graphene-based materials for fuel cells, batteries, photovoltaics and supercapacitors. We also outline both the bright prospects and emerging challenges these techniques face for application to graphene-based energy materials in future.},

Hydrophobic pores are formed in the lipid bilayer by spontaneous fluctuations. If these water-filled defects extend to a radius of 0.3 to 0.5 nm, a hydrophilic pore is formed by reorientation of the lipid molecules. This process is favoured by a potential difference across the membrane. The conductivity of the pores depends on membrane voltage, and the type of this dependence changes with the radius of the pore. Hydrophilic pores of an effective radius of 0.6 up to more than 1 nm are formed, which account for the membrane conductivity increase observed.

abstract = {We characterize the rate-limiting interaction of the antibiotic enrofloxacin with OmpF, a channel from the outer cell wall of Escherichia coli . Reconstitution of a single OmpF trimer into planar lipid membranes allows measurement of the ion current through the channel. Penetration of antibiotics causes ion current blockages, and their frequency allows a conclusion on the kinetics of channel entry and exit. In contrast to other antibiotics, enrofloxacin is able to block the OmpF channel for several milliseconds, reflecting high affinities comparable to substrate-specific channels such as the maltodextrin-specific maltoporin. Surprisingly, the presence of a divalent ion such as Mg(2+) leads to fast flickering with an increase in the rates of association and dissociation. All-atom computer modeling provides the most probable pathway able to identify the relevant rate-limiting interaction during antibiotic permeation. Mg(2+) has a high affinity for the aspartic acid at the 113 position (D113) in the center of the OmpF intracellular binding site. Therefore, the presence of Mg(2+) reverses the charge and enrofloxacin may cross the constriction region in its favorable orientation with the carboxylic group first.},

abstract = {Biomimetic nanopores based on membrane-spanning single-walled carbon nanotubes have been designed to include selectivity filters based on combinations of anionic and cationic groups mimicking those present in bacterial porins and in voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels. The ion permeation and selectivity properties of these nanopores when embedded in a phospholipid bilayer have been explored by molecular dynamics simulations and free energy profile calculations. The interactions of the nanopores with sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride ions have been explored as a function of the number of anionic and cationic groups within the selectivity filter. Unbiased molecular dynamics simulations show that the overall selectivity is largely determined by the net charge of the filter. Analysis of distribution functions reveals considerable structuring of the distribution of ions and water within the nanopores. The distributions of ions along the pore axis reveal local selectivity for cations around filter, even in those nanopores (C0) where the net filter charge is zero. Single ion free energy profiles also reveal clear evidence for cation selectivity, even in the C0 nanopores. Detailed analysis of the interactions of the C0 nanopore with Ca(2+) ions reveals that local interactions with the anionic (carboxylate) groups of the selectivity filter lead to (partial) replacement of solvating water as the ion passes through the pore. These studies suggest that a computational biomimetic approach can be used to evaluate our understanding of the design principles of nanopores and channels.},

Data on Ru(NH3)6(3+) transport across the membrane in aqueous solution also indicated transport through aligned CNT cores of the observed microstructure. The lengths of the nanotubes within the polymer film were reduced by selective electrochemical oxidation, allowing for tunable pore lengths. Oxidative trimming processes resulted in carboxylate end groups that were readily functionalized at the entrance to each CNT inner core. Membranes with CNT tips that were functionalized with biotin showed a reduction in Ru(NH3)6(3+) flux by a factor of 15 when bound with streptavidin, thereby demonstrating the ability to gate molecular transport through CNT cores for potential applications in chemical separations and sensing.},

One copy of SecA in an intermediate state of ATP hydrolysis is bound to one molecule of the SecY complex. Both partners undergo important conformational changes on interaction. The polypeptide-cross-linking domain of SecA makes a large conformational change that could capture the translocation substrate in a 'clamp'. Polypeptide movement through the SecY channel could be achieved by the motion of a 'two-helix finger' of SecA inside the cytoplasmic funnel of SecY, and by the coordinated tightening and widening of SecA's clamp above the SecY pore. SecA binding generates a 'window' at the lateral gate of the SecY channel and it displaces the plug domain, preparing the channel for signal sequence binding and channel opening.},

abstract = {The x-ray coordinates of beta-barrel transmembrane proteins from the porins superfamily and relatives are used to calculate the mean tilt of the beta-strands and their mean local twist and coiling angles. The 13 proteins examined correspond to beta-barrels with 8 to 22 strands, and shear numbers ranging from 8 to 24. The results are compared with predictions from the model of Murzin, Lesk, and Chothia for symmetrical regular barrels. Good agreement is found for the mean strand tilt, but the twist angles are smaller than those for open beta-sheets and beta-barrels with shorter strands. The model is reparameterised to account for the reduced twist characteristic of long-stranded transmembrane beta-barrels. This produces predictions of both twist and coiling angles that are in agreement with the mean values obtained from the x-ray structures. With the optimized parameters, the model can then be used to determine twist and coiling angles of transmembrane beta-barrels from measurements of the amide band infrared dichroism in oriented membranes. Satisfactory agreement is obtained for OmpF. The strand tilt obtained from the x-ray coordinates, or from the reparameterised model, can be combined with infrared dichroism measurements to obtain information on the orientation of the beta-barrel assembly in the membrane.},

abstract = {Porins are trimeric channel-forming proteins of the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. Each subunit contains 16 beta-strands forming a transmembrane beta-barrel whose pore is constricted by the third extracellular loop (L3). We investigated the effects of site-directed mutations at two critical regions of the OmpC porin: (i) the D315A mutation targets a key component of a putative hydrogen bond network linking the L3 loop to the adjacent barrel wall and (ii) the D118Q, R174Q and R92Q mutations target putative salt bridges at the root of the L3 loop. We purified the outer membrane fractions obtained from each mutant and reconstituted them in liposomes suitable for electrophysiology. Patch clamp experiments showed that the frequency of spontaneous transitions between open and closed states is increased in the D315A, D118Q and R92Q mutants but unchanged in the R174Q mutant. These transitions are not driven by transmembrane voltage changes and represent the thermal oscillations between functionally distinct conformations. The asymmetric voltage-dependent inactivation of the channels is not affected by the mutations, however, suggesting different molecular mechanisms for the spontaneous and voltage-dependent gating processes. We propose that the positioning or flexibility of the L3 loop across the pore, as governed by the putative hydrogen-bond network and a salt bridge, play a role in determining the frequency of spontaneous channel gating.},

abstract = {The outer membrane protein OprP from Pseudomonas aeruginosa forms a phosphate selective pore. To understand the mechanism of phosphate permeation and selectivity, we used three simulation techniques [equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, steered molecular dynamics, and calculation of a potential of mean force (PMF)]. The PMF for phosphate reveals a deep free energy well midway along the OprP channel. Two adjacent phosphate-binding sites (W1 and W2), each with a well depth of approximately 8 kT, are identified close to the L3 loop in the most constricted region of the pore. A dissociation constant for phosphate of 6 microM is computed from the PMF, within the range of reported experimental values. The transfer of phosphate between sites W1 and W2 is correlated with changes in conformation of the sidechain of K121, which serves as a "charged brush" to facilitate phosphate passage between the two subsites. OprP also binds chloride, but less strongly than phosphate, as calculated from a Cl(-) PMF. The difference in affinity and hence selectivity is due to the "Lys-cluster" motif, the positive charges of which interact strongly with a partially dehydrated phosphate ion but are shielded from a Cl(-) by the hydration shell of the smaller ion. Our simulations suggest that OprP does not conform to the conventional picture of a channel with relatively flat energy landscape for permeant ions, but rather resembles a membrane-inserted binding protein with a high specificity that allows access to a centrally located binding site from both the extracellular and the periplasmic spaces.},

abstract = {The major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter lactose permease (LacY) alternates between cytoplasmic and periplasmic open conformations to co-transport a sugar molecule together with a proton across the plasma membrane. Indirect experimental evidence suggested the existence of an occluded transition intermediate of LacY, which would prevent leaking of the proton gradient. As no experimental structure is known, the conformational transition is not fully understood in atomic detail. We simulated transition events from a cytoplasmic open conformation to a periplasmic open conformation with the dynamic importance sampling molecular dynamics method and observed occluded intermediates. Analysis of water permeation pathways and the electrostatic free-energy landscape of a solvated proton indicated that the occluded state contains a solvated central cavity inaccessible from either side of the membrane. We propose a pair of geometric order parameters that capture the state of the pathway through the MFS transporters as shown by a survey of available crystal structures and models. We present a model for the occluded state of apo-LacY, which is similar to the occluded crystal structures of the MFS transporters EmrD, PepTSo, NarU, PiPT and XylE. Our simulations are consistent with experimental double electron spin–spin distance measurements that have been interpreted to show occluded conformations. During the simulations, a salt bridge that has been postulated to be involved in driving the conformational transition formed. Our results argue against a simple rigid-body domain motion as implied by a strict “rocker-switch mechanism” and instead hint at an intricate coupling between two flexible gates.},

Simulation-based assessment of the lipid interactions made by Aqps when embedded within a simple phospholipid bilayer agrees well with the protein-lipid contacts determined by electron diffraction from 2D crystals. Extending this simulation-based analysis to all Aqps of known structure reveals a degree of conservation of such interactions across the Aqp structural proteome. Despite similarities in the binding orientations and interactions of the lipids, there do not appear to be distinct, high-specificity lipid binding sites on the surface of Aqps. Rather Aqps exhibit a more broadly conserved protein/lipid interface, suggestive of interchange between annular and bulk lipids, instead of a fixed annular "shell" of lipids. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The transition from unicellular to multicellular life, which occurred several times during evolution, requires tight interaction and communication of neighboring cells. The multicellular cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 forms filaments of hundreds of interacting cells exchanging metabolites and signal molecules and is able to differentiate specialized cells in response to environmental stimuli. Mutation of cell wall amidase AmiC2 leads to a severe phenotype with formation of aberrant septa in the distorted filaments, which completely lack cell communication and potential for cell differentiation. Here we demonstrate the function of the amidase AmiC2 in formation of cell-joining structures. The AmiC2 protein localizes to the young septum between cells and shows bona fide amidase activity in vivo and in vitro. Vancomycin staining identified the overall septum morphology in living cells. By electron microscopy of isolated peptidoglycan sacculi, the submicroscopic structure of the cell junctions could be visualized, revealing a novel function for a cell wall amidase: AmiC2 drills holes into the cross-walls, forming an array of $\sim$155 nanopores with a diameter of $\sim$20 nm each. These nanopores seem to constitute a framework for cell-joining proteins, penetrating the cell wall. The entire array of junctional nanopores appears as a novel bacterial organelle, establishing multicellularity in a filamentous prokaryote.},

abstract = {GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system and acts at a variety of receptors including GABAC receptors, which are a subclass of GABAA receptors. Here we have used molecular dynamics simulations of GABA docked into the extracellular domain of the GABAC receptor to explain the molecular interactions of the neurotransmitter with the residues that contribute to the binding site; in particular, we have explored the interaction of GABA with Arg104. The simulations suggest that the amine group of GABA forms cation-pi interactions with Tyr102 and Tyr198, and hydrogen-bonds with Gln83, Glu220, Ser243, and Ser168, and, most prominently, with Arg104. Substituting Arg104 with Ala, Glu, or Lys, which experimentally disrupt GABAC receptor function, and repeating the simulation revealed fewer and different bonding patterns with GABA, or the rapid exit of GABA from the binding pocket. The simulations therefore unveil interactions of GABA within the binding pocket, and explain experimental data, which indicate that Arg104 is critical for the efficient functioning of the receptor.},

abstract = {Single-channel conductance in Cys-loop channels is controlled by the nature of the amino acids in the narrowest parts of the ion conduction pathway, namely the second transmembrane domain (M2) and the intracellular helix. In cationic channels, such as Torpedo ACh nicotinic receptors, conductance is increased by negatively charged residues exposed to the extracellular vestibule. We now show that positively charged residues at the same loop 5 position boost also the conductance of anionic Cys-loop channels, such as glycine ($\alpha$1 and $\alpha$1$\beta$) and GABA(A) ($\alpha$1$\beta$2$\gamma$2) receptors. Charge reversal mutations here produce a greater decrease on outward conductance, but their effect strongly depends on which subunit carries the mutation. In the glycine $\alpha$1$\beta$ receptor, replacing Lys with Glu in $\alpha$1 reduces single-channel conductance by 41%, but has no effect in the $\beta$ subunit. By expressing concatameric receptors with constrained stoichiometry, we show that this asymmetry is not explained by the subunit copy number. A similar pattern is observed in the $\alpha$1$\beta$2$\gamma$2 GABA(A) receptor, where only mutations in $\alpha$1 or $\beta$2 decreased conductance (to different extents). In both glycine and GABA receptors, the effect of mutations in different subunits does not sum linearly: mutations that had no detectable effect in isolation did enhance the effect of mutations carried by other subunits. As in the nicotinic receptor, charged residues in the extracellular vestibule of anionic Cys-loop channels influence elementary conductance. The size of this effect strongly depends on the direction of the ion flow and, unexpectedly, on the nature of the subunit that carries the residue.},

abstract = {The X-ray structure of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) has recently provided structural insight into this family of ion channels at high resolution. The structure shows a homo-pentameric protein with a barrel-stave architecture that defines an ion-conduction pore located on the fivefold axis of symmetry. In this structure, the wide aqueous vestibule that is encircled by the extracellular ligand-binding domains of the five subunits narrows to a discontinuous pore that spans the lipid bilayer. The pore is constricted by bulky hydrophobic residues towards the extracellular side, which probably serve as barriers that prevent the diffusion of ions. This interrupted pore architecture in ELIC thus depicts a non-conducting conformation of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel, the thermodynamically stable state in the absence of bound ligand. As ligand binding promotes pore opening in these ion channels and the specific ligand for ELIC has not yet been identified, we have turned our attention towards a homologous protein from the cyanobacterium Gloebacter violaceus (GLIC). GLIC was shown to form proton-gated channels that are activated by a pH decrease on the extracellular side and that do not desensitize after activation. Both prokaryotic proteins, ELIC and GLIC form ion channels that are selective for cations over anions with poor discrimination among monovalent cations, characteristics that resemble the conduction properties of the cation-selective branch of the family that includes acetylcholine and serotonin receptors. Here we present the X-ray structure of GLIC at 3.1 A resolution. The structure reveals a conformation of the channel that is distinct from ELIC and that probably resembles the open state. In combination, both structures suggest a novel gating mechanism for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels where channel opening proceeds by a change in the tilt of the pore-forming helices.},

abstract = {The glycine receptor chloride channel (GlyR) is a member of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor family of ligand-gated ion channels. Functional receptors of this family comprise five subunits and are important targets for neuroactive drugs. The GlyR is best known for mediating inhibitory neurotransmission in the spinal cord and brain stem, although recent evidence suggests it may also have other physiological roles, including excitatory neurotransmission in embryonic neurons. To date, four alpha-subunits (alpha1 to alpha4) and one beta-subunit have been identified. The differential expression of subunits underlies a diversity in GlyR pharmacology. A developmental switch from alpha2 to alpha1beta is completed by around postnatal day 20 in the rat. The beta-subunit is responsible for anchoring GlyRs to the subsynaptic cytoskeleton via the cytoplasmic protein gephyrin. The last few years have seen a surge in interest in these receptors. Consequently, a wealth of information has recently emerged concerning GlyR molecular structure and function. Most of the information has been obtained from homomeric alpha1 GlyRs, with the roles of the other subunits receiving relatively little attention. Heritable mutations to human GlyR genes give rise to a rare neurological disorder, hyperekplexia (or startle disease). Similar syndromes also occur in other species. A rapidly growing list of compounds has been shown to exert potent modulatory effects on this receptor. Since GlyRs are involved in motor reflex circuits of the spinal cord and provide inhibitory synapses onto pain sensory neurons, these agents may provide lead compounds for the development of muscle relaxant and peripheral analgesic drugs.},

abstract = {The molecular structure of the yeast nuclear pore complex (NPC) and the translocation of model particles have been studied with a molecular theory that accounts for the geometry of the pore and the sequence and anchoring position of the unfolded domains of the nucleoporin proteins (the FG-Nups), which control selective transport through the pore. The theory explicitly models the electrostatic, hydrophobic, steric, conformational, and acid-base properties of the FG-Nups. The electrostatic potential within the pore, which arises from the specific charge distribution of the FG-Nups, is predicted to be negative close to pore walls and positive along the pore axis. The positive electrostatic potential facilitates the translocation of negatively charged particles, and the free energy barrier for translocation decreases for increasing particle hydrophobicity. These results agree with the experimental observation that transport receptors that form complexes with hydrophilic/neutral or positively charged proteins to transport them through the NPC are both hydrophobic and strongly negatively charged. The molecular theory shows that the effects of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions on the translocating potential are cooperative and nonequivalent due to the interaction-dependent reorganization of the FG-Nups in the presence of the translocating particle. The combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions can give rise to complex translocation potentials displaying a combination of wells and barriers, in contrast to the simple barrier potential observed for a hydrophilic/neutral translocating particle. This work demonstrates the importance of explicitly considering the amino acid sequence and hydrophobic, electrostatic, and steric interactions in understanding the translocation through the NPC.},

The resistance is many orders of magnitude higher than for electrolyte-filled membranes and does not depend on the electrolyte concentration or pH, but it does depend on the type of hydrophobic monolayer and its density. The corresponding surface resistance varies from greater than 10(18) Omega per square to less than 3 x 10(9) Omega per square. When the hydrophobic monolayer contains a small proportion of photoactive spiropyran that is insufficient to switch the surface to hydrophilic after spiropyran photoisomerization to the merocyanine form, the membrane resistance also becomes light-dependent with a reversible increase of surface resistance by as much as 15%. Surface conduction is ascribed to hydration and ionization of the alumina surface hydroxyls and the ionizable groups of the hydrophobic surface modifiers.},

abstract = {P4-ATPases (flippases) translocate specific phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine from the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane to the cytosolic leaflet, upholding an essential membrane asymmetry. The mechanism of flipping this giant substrate has remained an enigma. We have investigated the importance of amino acid residues in transmembrane segment M4 of mammalian P4-ATPase ATP8A2 by mutagenesis. In the related ion pumps Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase, M4 moves during the enzyme cycle, carrying along the ion bound to a glutamate. In ATP8A2, the corresponding residue is an isoleucine, which recently was found mutated in patients with cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, and dysequilibrium syndrome. Our analyses of the lipid substrate concentration dependence of the overall and partial reactions of the enzyme cycle in mutants indicate that, during the transport across the membrane, the phosphatidylserine head group passes near isoleucine-364 (I364) and that I364 is critical to the release of the transported lipid into the cytosolic leaflet. Another M4 residue, N359, is involved in recognition of the lipid substrate on the exoplasmic side. Our functional studies are supported by structural homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, suggesting that I364 and adjacent hydrophobic residues function as a hydrophobic gate that separates the entry and exit sites of the lipid and directs sequential formation and annihilation of water-filled cavities, thereby enabling transport of the hydrophilic phospholipid head group in a groove outlined by the transmembrane segments M1, M2, M4, and M6, with the hydrocarbon chains following passively, still in the membrane lipid phase.},

abstract = {A new Lagrangian formulation is introduced. It can be used to make molecular dynamics (MD) calculations on systems under the most general, externally applied, conditions of stress. In this formulation the MD cell shape and size can change according to dynamical equations given by this Lagrangian. This new MD technique is well suited to the study of structural transformations in solids under external stress and at finite temperature. As an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the stress‐strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a bifurcation in its stress‐strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal close packing. It is suggested that such a transformation could perhaps be observed experimentally under extreme conditions of shock.},

abstract = {Nerve signaling in humans and chemical sensing in bacteria both rely on the controlled opening and closing of the ion-conducting pore in pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. With the help of a multiscale simulation approach that combines mixed elastic network model calculations with molecular dynamics simulations, we study the opening and closing of the pore in Gloeobacter violaceus channel GLIC at atomic resolution. In our simulations of the GLIC transmembrane domain, we first verify that the two endpoints of the transition are open and closed to sodium ion conduction, respectively. We then show that a two-stage tilting of the pore-lining helices induces cooperative drying and iris-like closing of the channel pore. From the free energy profile of the gating transition and from unrestrained simulations, we conclude that the pore of the isolated GLIC transmembrane domain closes spontaneously. The mechanical work of opening the pore is performed primarily on the M2-M3 loop. Strong interactions of this short and conserved loop with the extracellular domain are therefore crucial to couple ligand binding to channel opening.},

This approach relies on the continuous estimation of a biasing force that yields a Hamiltonian in which no average force is exerted along the ordering parameter xi. Optimizing the parameters that control how the ABF is applied, the method is shown to be extremely effective when a nonequivocal ordering parameter can be defined to explore the folding pathway of the peptide. Starting from a beta-turn motif and restraining xi to a region of the conformational space that extends from the alpha-helical state to an ensemble of extended structures, the ABF scheme is successful in folding the peptide chain into a compact alpha helix. Sampling of this conformation is, however, marginal when the range of xi values embraces arrangements of greater compactness, hence demonstrating the inherent limitations of free-energy methods when ambiguous ordering parameters are utilized.},

We describe here the conformational change underlying this event, determined by electron microscopy of ACh-sprayed and freeze-trapped postsynaptic membranes. ACh binding to the ?? subunits triggers a concerted rearrangement in the ligand-binding domain, involving an ??? 1-?? outward displacement of the extracellular portion of the ?? subunit where it interacts with the juxtaposed ends of ??-helices shaping the narrow membrane-spanning pore. The ??-subunit helices tilt outward to accommodate this displacement, destabilising the arrangement of pore-lining helices, which in the closed channel bend inward symmetrically to form a central hydrophobic gate. Straightening and tangential motion of the pore-lining helices effect channel opening by widening the pore asymmetrically and increasing its polarity in the region of the gate. The pore-lining helices of the ???? and ?? subunits, by flexing between alternative bent and straight conformations, undergo the greatest movements. This coupled allosteric transition shifts the structure from a tense (closed) state toward a more relaxed (open) state. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The protein YidC inserts its substrates into the membrane, thereby facilitating membrane protein assembly in bacteria; the homologous proteins Oxa1 and Alb3 have the same function in mitochondria and chloroplasts, respectively. In the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, YidC functions as an independent insertase and a membrane chaperone in cooperation with the translocon SecYEG. Here we present the crystal structure of YidC from Bacillus halodurans, at 2.4 \AA resolution. The structure reveals a novel fold, in which five conserved transmembrane helices form a positively charged hydrophilic groove that is open towards both the lipid bilayer and the cytoplasm but closed on the extracellular side. Structure-based in vivo analyses reveal that a conserved arginine residue in the groove is important for the insertion of membrane proteins by YidC. We propose an insertion mechanism for single-spanning membrane proteins, in which the hydrophilic environment generated by the groove recruits the extracellular regions of substrates into the low-dielectric environment of the membrane.},

abstract = {Cys-loop receptors constitute a superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs), including receptors for acetylcholine, serotonin, glycine and $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid. Several bacterial homologues have been identified that are excellent models for understanding allosteric binding of alcohols and anesthetics in human Cys-loop receptors. Recently, we showed that a single point mutation on a prokaryotic homologue (GLIC) could transform it from a channel weakly potentiated by ethanol into a highly ethanol-sensitive channel. Here, we have employed molecular simulations to study ethanol binding to GLIC, and to elucidate the role of the ethanol-enhancing mutation in GLIC modulation. By performing 1-µs simulations with and without ethanol on wild-type and mutated GLIC, we observed spontaneous binding in both intra-subunit and inter-subunit transmembrane cavities. In contrast to the glycine receptor GlyR, in which we previously observed ethanol binding primarily in an inter-subunit cavity, ethanol primarily occupied an intra-subunit cavity in wild-type GLIC. However, the highly ethanol-sensitive GLIC mutation significantly enhanced ethanol binding in the inter-subunit cavity. These results demonstrate dramatic effects of the F(14')A mutation on the distribution of ligands, and are consistent with a two-site model of pLGIC inhibition and potentiation.},

abstract = {Voltage sensor domains (VSDs) are membrane-bound protein modules that confer voltage sensitivity to membrane proteins. VSDs sense changes in the transmembrane voltage and convert the electrical signal into a conformational change called activation. Activation involves a reorganization of the membrane protein charges that is detected experimentally as transient currents. These so-called gating currents have been investigated extensively within the theoretical framework of so-called discrete-state Markov models (DMMs), whereby activation is conceptualized as a series of transitions across a discrete set of states. Historically, the interpretation of DMM transition rates in terms of transition state theory has been instrumental in shaping our view of the activation process, whose free-energy profile is currently envisioned as composed of a few local minima separated by steep barriers. Here we use atomistic level modeling and well-tempered metadynamics to calculate the configurational free energy along a single transition from first principles. We show that this transition is intrinsically multidimensional and described by a rough free-energy landscape. Remarkably, a coarse-grained description of the system, based on the use of the gating charge as reaction coordinate, reveals a smooth profile with a single barrier, consistent with phenomenological models. Our results bridge the gap between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of activation dynamics and show that choosing the gating charge as reaction coordinate masks the topological complexity of the network of microstates participating in the transition. Importantly, full characterization of the latter is a prerequisite to rationalize modulation of this process by lipids, toxins, drugs, and genetic mutations.},

In this study, the recently developed adaptive steered molecular dynamics (ASMD) algorithm [G. Ozer, E. Valeev, S. Quirk, and R. Hernandez, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 6, 3026 (2010)] is used to reproduce the PMF of the unraveling of decaalanine in vacuum by averaging over fewer nonequilibrium trajectories. The efficiency and accuracy of the method are demonstrated through the agreement with the earlier work by Park and Schulten, a series of convergence checks compared to alternate SMD pulling strategies, and an analytical proof. The nonequilibrium trajectories obtained through ASMD have also been used to analyze the intrapeptide hydrogen bonds along the stretching coordinate. As the decaalanine helix is stretched, the initially stabilized i → i + 4 contacts ($\alpha$-helix) is replaced by i → i + 3 contacts (3(10)-helix). No significant formation of i → i + 5 hydrogen bonds ($\pi$-helix) is observed.},

abstract = {Solid-state nanopores have emerged as possible candidates for next-generation DNA sequencing devices. In such a device, the DNA sequence would be determined by measuring how the forces on the DNA molecules, and also the ion currents through the nanopore, change as the molecules pass through the nanopore. Unlike their biological counterparts, solid-state nanopores have the advantage that they can withstand a wide range of analyte solutions and environments. Here we report solid-state nanopore channels that are selective towards single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Nanopores functionalized with a 'probe' of hair-pin loop DNA can, under an applied electrical field, selectively transport short lengths of 'target' ssDNA that are complementary to the probe. Even a single base mismatch between the probe and the target results in longer translocation pulses and a significantly reduced number of translocation events. Our single-molecule measurements allow us to measure separately the molecular flux and the pulse duration, providing a tool to gain fundamental insight into the channel-molecule interactions. The results can be explained in the conceptual framework of diffusive molecular transport with particle-channel interactions.},

abstract = {Despite its ubiquitous character and relevance in many branches of science and engineering, nucleation from solution remains elusive. In this framework, molecular simulations represent a powerful tool to provide insight into nucleation at the molecular scale. In this work, we combine theory and molecular simulations to describe urea nucleation from aqueous solution. Taking advantage of well-tempered metadynamics, we compute the free-energy change associated to the phase transition. We find that such a free-energy profile is characterized by significant finite-size effects that can, however, be accounted for. The description of the nucleation process emerging from our analysis differs from classical nucleation theory. Nucleation of crystal-like clusters is in fact preceded by large concentration fluctuations, indicating a predominant two-step process, whereby embryonic crystal nuclei emerge from dense, disordered urea clusters. Furthermore, in the early stages of nucleation, two different polymorphs are seen to compete.},

abstract = {The Min proteins (MinC, MinD, and MinE) form a pole-to-pole oscillator that controls the spatial assembly of the division machinery in Escherichia coli cells. Previous studies identified that interactions of MinD with phospholipids positioned the Min machinery at the membrane. We extend these studies by measuring the affinity, kinetics, and ATPase activity of E. coli MinD, MinE, and MinDE binding to supported lipid bilayers containing varying compositions of anionic phospholipids. Using quartz crystal microbalance measurements, we found that the binding affinity (K(d)) for the interaction of recombinant E. coli MinD and MinE with lipid bilayers increased with increasing concentration of the anionic phospholipids phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. The K(d) for MinD (1.8 $\mu$M) in the presence of ATP was smaller than for MinE (12.1 $\mu$M) binding to membranes consisting of 95:5 phosphatidylcholine/cardiolipin. The simultaneous binding of MinD and MinE to membranes revealed that increasing the concentration of anionic phospholipid stimulates the initial rate of adsorption (k(on)). The ATPase activity of MinD decreased in the presence of anionic phospholipids. These results indicate that anionic lipids, which are concentrated at the poles, increase the retention of MinD and MinE and explain its dwell time at this region of bacterial cells. These studies provide insight into interactions between MinD and MinE and between these proteins and membranes that are relevant to understanding the process of bacterial cell division, in which the interaction of proteins and membranes is essential.},

abstract = {Interactions of lipids are central to the folding and stability of membrane proteins. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations have been used to reveal the mechanisms of self-assembly of protein/membrane and protein/detergent complexes for representatives of two classes of membrane protein, namely, glycophorin (a simple alpha-helical bundle) and OmpA (a beta-barrel). The accuracy of the coarse-grained simulations is established via comparison with the equivalent atomistic simulations of self-assembly of protein/detergent micelles. The simulation of OmpA/bilayer self-assembly reveals how a folded outer membrane protein can be inserted in a bilayer. The glycophorin/bilayer simulation supports the two-state model of membrane folding, in which transmembrane helix insertion precedes dimer self-assembly within a bilayer. The simulations also suggest that a dynamic equilibrium exists between the glycophorin helix monomer and dimer within a bilayer. The simulated glycophorin helix dimer is remarkably close in structure to that revealed by NMR. Thus, coarse-grained methods may help to define mechanisms of membrane protein (re)folding and will prove suitable for simulation of larger scale dynamic rearrangements of biological membranes.},

Urea uptake is greatly enhanced and regulated by HpUreI, a proton-gated inner membrane channel protein essential for gastric survival of H. pylori. The crystal structure of HpUreI describes a static snapshot of the channel with two constriction sites near the center of the bilayer that are too narrow to allow passage of urea or even water. Here we describe the urea transport mechanism at atomic resolution, revealed by unrestrained microsecond equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of the hexameric channel assembly. Two consecutive constrictions open to allow conduction of urea, which is guided through the channel by interplay between conserved residues that determine proton rejection and solute selectivity. Remarkably, HpUreI conducts water at rates equivalent to aquaporins, which might be essential for efficient transport of urea at small concentration gradients.},

abstract = {Among numerous biological activities, natural polyphenols are antioxidants widely distributed in plants capable of inhibiting lipid peroxidation, which belongs to the most serious degenerative cell processes. Positioning of antioxidants in lipid bilayers can provide an insight to the lipid-peroxidation inhibition at the molecular level. This work aims at determining the location and orientation of quercetin and its most representative (glucuronidated, methylated, and sulfated) metabolites in lipid bilayer via molecular dynamic simulations. We show that quercetin derivatives penetrate the lipid bilayer and that the depths of penetration depend on molecular charge and substitutional variations. In the presence of charged substituents (sulfates and glucuronidates), the molecule is pulled toward the lipid bilayer surface. The orientation also depends on substitution as H-bonds are formed between the polar head groups of the bilayer and the (i) OH groups, (ii) sugar, and (iii) sulfate moieties of the antioxidants. As flavonoids and their derivatives are preferentially localized in the lipid bilayer membrane or on the bilayer/water interface, they readily concentrate in a relatively narrow membrane region. Despite the low concentrations of flavonoids in food, their spatial confinement in the membrane greatly enhances their local concentration in this vital region, thus increasing their importance for in vivo biological activities including oxidative stress defense.},

Permanent channel opening occurred when the plug was moved out of the way by disulfide-bridge formation.

abstract = {Hydrophobicity is a fundamental property that is responsible for numerous physical and biophysical aspects of molecular interactions in water. Peculiar behavior is expected for water in the vicinity of hydrophobic structures, such as nanopores. Indeed, hydrophobic nanopores can be found in two distinct states, dry and wet, even though the latter is thermodynamically unstable. Transitions between these two states are kinetically hindered in long pores but can be much faster in shorter pores. As it is demonstrated for the first time in this paper, these transitions can be induced by applying a voltage across a membrane with a single hydrophobic nanopore. Such voltage-induced gating in single nanopores can be realized in a reversible manner through electrowetting of inner walls of the nanopores. The resulting I-V curves of such artificial hydrophobic nanopores mimic biological voltage gated channels.},

abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 virus can cause morbidity and mortality in humans but thus far has not acquired the ability to be transmitted by aerosol or respiratory droplet ("airborne transmission") between humans. To address the concern that the virus could acquire this ability under natural conditions, we genetically modified A/H5N1 virus by site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent serial passage in ferrets. The genetically modified A/H5N1 virus acquired mutations during passage in ferrets, ultimately becoming airborne transmissible in ferrets. None of the recipient ferrets died after airborne infection with the mutant A/H5N1 viruses. Four amino acid substitutions in the host receptor-binding protein hemagglutinin, and one in the polymerase complex protein basic polymerase 2, were consistently present in airborne-transmitted viruses. The transmissible viruses were sensitive to the antiviral drug oseltamivir and reacted well with antisera raised against H5 influenza vaccine strains. Thus, avian A/H5N1 influenza viruses can acquire the capacity for airborne transmission between mammals without recombination in an intermediate host and therefore constitute a risk for human pandemic influenza.},

abstract = {Bacteria face the challenging requirement to maintain their shape and avoid rupture due to the high internal turgor pressure, but simultaneously permit the import and export of nutrients, chemical signals, and virulence factors. The bacterial cell wall, a mesh-like structure composed of cross-linked strands of peptidoglycan, fulfills both needs by being semi-rigid, yet sufficiently porous to allow diffusion through it. How the mechanical properties of the cell wall are determined by the molecular features and the spatial arrangement of the relatively thin strands in the larger cellular-scale structure is not known. To examine this issue, we have developed and simulated atomic-scale models of Escherichia coli cell walls in a disordered circumferential arrangement. The cell-wall models are found to possess an anisotropic elasticity, as known experimentally, arising from the orthogonal orientation of the glycan strands and of the peptide cross-links. Other features such as thickness, pore size, and disorder are also found to generally agree with experiments, further supporting the disordered circumferential model of peptidoglycan. The validated constructs illustrate how mesoscopic structure and behavior emerge naturally from the underlying atomic-scale properties and, furthermore, demonstrate the ability of all-atom simulations to reproduce a range of macroscopic observables for extended polymer meshes.},

abstract = {The use of semipermeable membranes containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that form continuous pores has been suggested as a way to reduce the cost of desalination via reverse osmosis. Example membranes containing aligned CNTs have been fabricated, but obtaining only the very narrow pores that are able to block the passage of ions while allowing a rapid flow of water remains a challenge and previous computational studies have focused on idealised tubes. Here molecular dynamics simulations are used to examine water and ion transport through functionalised CNTs with the aim of investigating whether such chemical modification allows the performance of CNT based membranes to be improved, or for larger diameter pores to be used. A range of different charged and polar functional groups were added to a 1.1 nm diameter (8,8) CNT that was previously found to be only moderately effective at rejecting ions. These CNTs were incorporated into membranes and simulations were conducted with a hydrostatic pressure difference to determine the ion rejection and flux of water passing through each as well as the energy barriers presented to ions and water molecules. The results show that the addition of charges at the entrance of the pore can help to prevent the passage of ions, however, any functionalisation also reduces the flow of water through the membrane due to increased electrostatic interactions between the water molecules and the CNT. Assuming pore densities that have previously been achieved, the performance of these membranes in the simulations is still many times better than existing technology and thus the inclusion of functionalised CNTs in desalination membranes may prove to be useful in achieving salt rejection and rapid water flow.},

abstract = {The cellular energy machinery depends on the presence and properties of protons at or in the vicinity of lipid membranes. To asses the energetics and mobility of a proton near a membrane, we simulated an excess proton near a solvated DMPC bilayer at 323 K, using a recently developed method to include the Grotthuss proton shuttling mechanism in classical molecular dynamics simulations. We obtained a proton surface affinity of -13.0 ± 0.5 kJ mol-1. The proton interacted strongly with both lipid headgroup and linker carbonyl oxygens. Furthermore, the surface diffusion of the proton was anomalous, with a subdiffusive regime over the first few nanoseconds, followed by a superdiffusive regime. The time- and distance dependence of the proton surface diffusion coefficient within these regimes may also resolve discrepancies between previously reported diffusion coefficients. Our simulations show that the proton anomalous surface diffusion originates from restricted diffusion in two different surface-bound states, interrupted by the occasional bulk-mediated long-range surface diffusion. Although only a DMPC membrane was considered in this work, we speculate that the restrictive character of the on-surface diffusion is highly sensitive to the specific membrane conditions, which can alter the relative contributions of the surface and bulk pathways to the overall diffusion process. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the energy machinery. © 2014 Biophysical Society.},

In our earlier studies, cyclodextrin adapters were lodged noncovalently within the lumen of the alphaHL pore. In the present work, we have realized the controlled covalent attachment of a beta-cyclodextrin (betaCD) adapter in the two possible molecular orientations inside alphaHL pores prepared by genetic engineering. There are two advantages to such a covalent system. First, the adapter cannot dissociate, which means there are no gaps during stochastic detection, a crucial advance for single-molecule exonuclease DNA sequencing where the continuous presence of a molecular adapter will be essential for reading individual nucleotides. Second, the ability to orient the adapter allows analytes to bind through only one of the two entrances to the betaCD cavity. We demonstrate that the covalently attached adapters can be used to alter the ion selectivity of the alphaHL pore, examine binding events at elevated temperatures, and detect analytes with prolonged dwell times.},

abstract = {As plasma membranes of animal cells are known to be asymmetric, the transmembrane lipid asymmetry, being essential for many membranes' properties and functions, should be properly accounted for in model membrane systems. In this paper, we employ atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations to explore electroporation phenomena in asymmetric model membranes comprised of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipid monolayers that mimic the outer and inner leaflets of plasma membranes, respectively. Our findings clearly demonstrate that the molecular mechanism of electroporation in asymmetric phospholipid membranes differs considerably from the picture observed for their single-component symmetric counterparts: The initial stages of electric-field-induced formation of a water-filled pore turn out to be asymmetric and occur mainly on the PC side of the PC/PE membrane. In particular, water molecules penetrate in the membrane interior mostly from the PC side, and the reorientation of lipid head groups, being crucial for stabilizing the hydrophilic pore, also takes place in the PC leaflet. In contrast, the PE lipid head groups do not enter the central region of the membrane until the water pore becomes rather large and partly stabilized by PC head groups. Such behavior implies that the PE leaflet is considerably more robust against an electric field most likely due to interlipid hydrogen bonding. We also show that an electric field induces asymmetric changes in the lateral pressure profile of PC/PE membranes, decreasing the cohesion between lipid molecules predominantly in the PC membrane leaflet. Overall, our simulations provide compelling evidence that the transmembrane lipid asymmetry can be essential for understanding electroporation phenomena in living cells.},

abstract = {Continuum simulation is employed to study ion transport and fluid flow through a nanopore in a solid-state membrane under an applied potential drop. The results show the existence of concentration polarization layers on the surfaces of the membrane. The nonuniformity of the ionic distribution gives rise to an electric pressure that drives vortical motion in the fluid. There is also a net hydrodynamic flow through the nanopore due to an asymmetry induced by the membrane surface charge. The qualitative behavior is similar to that observed in a previous study using molecular dynamic simulations. The current-voltage characteristics show some nonlinear features but are not greatly affected by the hydrodynamic flow in the parameter regime studied. In the limit of thin Debye layers, the electric resistance of the system can be characterized using an equivalent circuit with lumped parameters. Generation of vorticity can be understood qualitatively from elementary considerations of the Maxwell stresses. However, the flow strength is a strongly nonlinear function of the applied field. Combination of electrophoretic and hydrodynamic effects can lead to ion selectivity in terms of valences and this could have some practical applications in separations.},

abstract = {Water desalination becomes an increasingly important approach for clean water supply to meet the rapidly growing demand of population boost, industrialization, and urbanization. The main challenge in current desalination technologies lies in the reduction of energy consumption and economic costs. Here, we propose to use charged nanopores drilled in a graphene sheet as ion exchange membranes to promote the efficiency and capacity of desalination systems. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the selective ion transport behavior of electric-field-driven KCl electrolyte solution through charge modified graphene nanopores. Our results reveal that the presence of negative charges at the edge of graphene nanopore can remarkably impede the passage of Cl(-) while enhance the transport of K(+), which is an indication of ion selectivity for electrolytes. We further demonstrate that this selectivity is dependent on the pore size and total charge number assigned at the nanopore edge. By adjusting the nanopore diameter and electric charge on the graphene nanopore, a nearly complete rejection of Cl(-) can be realized. The electrical resistance of nanoporous graphene, which is a key parameter to evaluate the performance of ion exchange membranes, is found two orders of magnitude lower than commercially used membranes. Our results thus suggest that graphene nanopores are promising candidates to be used in electrodialysis technology for water desalinations with a high permselectivity.},

abstract = {We have shown from both simulations and experiments that zwitterion functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be used to construct highly efficient desalination membranes. Our simulations predicted that zwitterion functional groups at the ends of CNTs allow a high flux of water, while rejecting essentially all ions. We have synthesized zwitterion functionalized CNT/polyamide nanocomposite membranes with varying loadings of CNTs and assessed these membranes for water desalination. The CNTs within the polyamide layer were partially aligned through a high-vacuum filtration step during membrane synthesis. Addition of zwitterion functionalized CNTs into a polyamide membrane increased both the flux of water and the salt rejection ratio. The flux of water was found to increase by more than a factor of 4, from 6.8 to 28.7 GFD (gallons per square foot per day), as the fraction of CNTs was increased from 0 to 20 wt %. Importantly, the ion rejection ratio increased slightly from 97.6% to 98.6%. Thus, the nanotubes imparted an additional transport mechanism to the polyamide membrane, having higher flow rate and the same or slightly better selectivity. Simulations show that when two zwitterions are attached to each end of CNTs having diameters of about 15 \AA, the ion rejection ratio is essentially 100%. In contrast, the rejection ratio for nonfunctionalized CNTs is about 0%, and roughly 20% for CNTs having five carboxylic acid groups per end. The increase in ion rejection for the zwitterion functionalized CNTs is due to a combination of steric hindrance from the functional groups partially blocking the tube ends and electrostatic repulsion between functional groups and ions, with steric effects dominating. Theoretical predictions indicate that an ideal CNT/polymer membrane having a loading of 20 wt % CNTs would have a maximum flux of about 20000 GFD at the conditions of our experiments.},

abstract = {The use of semipermeable membranes containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that form continuous pores has been suggested as a way to reduce the cost of desalination via reverse osmosis. Example membranes containing aligned CNTs have been fabricated, but obtaining only the very narrow pores that are able to block the passage of ions while allowing a rapid flow of water remains a challenge and previous computational studies have focused on idealised tubes. Here molecular dynamics simulations are used to examine water and ion transport through functionalised CNTs with the aim of investigating whether such chemical modification allows the performance of CNT based membranes to be improved, or for larger diameter pores to be used. A range of different charged and polar functional groups were added to a 1.1 nm diameter (8,8) CNT that was previously found to be only moderately effective at rejecting ions. These CNTs were incorporated into membranes and simulations were conducted with a hydrostatic pressure difference to determine the ion rejection and flux of water passing through each as well as the energy barriers presented to ions and water molecules. The results show that the addition of charges at the entrance of the pore can help to prevent the passage of ions, however, any functionalisation also reduces the flow of water through the membrane due to increased electrostatic interactions between the water molecules and the CNT. Assuming pore densities that have previously been achieved, the performance of these membranes in the simulations is still many times better than existing technology and thus the inclusion of functionalised CNTs in desalination membranes may prove to be useful in achieving salt rejection and rapid water flow.},

This approach relies on the continuous estimation of a biasing force that yields a Hamiltonian in which no average force is exerted along the ordering parameter xi. Optimizing the parameters that control how the ABF is applied, the method is shown to be extremely effective when a nonequivocal ordering parameter can be defined to explore the folding pathway of the peptide. Starting from a beta-turn motif and restraining xi to a region of the conformational space that extends from the alpha-helical state to an ensemble of extended structures, the ABF scheme is successful in folding the peptide chain into a compact alpha helix. Sampling of this conformation is, however, marginal when the range of xi values embraces arrangements of greater compactness, hence demonstrating the inherent limitations of free-energy methods when ambiguous ordering parameters are utilized.},

The structures of TodX and TbuX show significant differences with those previously determined for Escherichia coli FadL, which may provide an explanation for the substrate-specific transport of TodX and TbuX observed with in vivo transport assays. The TodX and TbuX structures revealed 14-stranded beta-barrels with an N-terminal hatch domain blocking the barrel interior. A hydrophobic channel with bound detergent molecules extends from the extracellular surface and is contiguous with a passageway through the hatch domain, lined by both hydrophobic and polar or charged residues.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been proposed that arginine residues lining the intracellular portals of the homomeric 5-HT3 A receptor cause electrostatic repulsion of cation flow, accounting for a single channel conductance substantially lower than that of the 5-HT3 AB heteromer. However, comparison of receptor homology models for wild-type pentamers suggests that salt bridges in the intracellular domain of the homomer may impart structural rigidity, and we hypothesised that this rigidity could account for the low conductance.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Mutations were introduced into the portal region of the human 5-HT3 A homopentamer such that putative salt bridges were broken by neutralising anionic partners. Single channel and whole cell currents were measured in transfected tsA201 cells and in Xenopus oocytes, respectively. Computational simulations of protein flexibility facilitated comparison of wild-type and mutant receptors.\n\nKEY RESULTS: Single channel conductance was increased substantially, often to wild-type heteromeric receptor values, in most 5-HT3 A mutants. Conversely, introduction of arginine residues to the portal region of the heteromer, conjecturally creating salt bridges, decreased conductance. Gating kinetics varied significantly between different mutant receptors. EC50 values for whole-cell responses to 5-HT remained largely unchanged, but Hill coefficients for responses to 5-HT were usually significantly smaller in mutants. Computational simulations suggested increased flexibility throughout the protein structure as a consequence of mutations in the intracellular domain.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These data support a role for intracellular salt bridges in maintaining quaternary structure of the 5-HT3 receptor and suggest a role for the intracellular domain in allosteric modulation of cooperativity and agonist efficacy.},

The intrinsic interface refers to molecular structure in terms of distances from the instantaneous interface. We show that attractive interactions between a hydrophobic surface and water affect capillary wave fluctuations of the instantaneous liquid interface, but these attractive interactions have essentially no effect on the intrinsic interface. Further, the intrinsic interface of liquid water and a hydrophobic substrate differs little from that of water and its vapor.The same is not true, we show, for an interface between water and a hydrophilic substrate. In that case, strong directional substrate-water interactions disrupt the liquid-vapor-like interfacial hydrogen bonding network.},

@article{Tagliazucchi2013c,
abstract = {The molecular structure of the yeast nuclear pore complex (NPC) and the translocation of model particles have been studied with a molecular theory that accounts for the geometry of the pore and the sequence and anchoring position of the unfolded domains of the nucleoporin proteins (the FG-Nups), which control selective transport through the pore. The theory explicitly models the electrostatic, hydrophobic, steric, conformational, and acid-base properties of the FG-Nups. The electrostatic potential within the pore, which arises from the specific charge distribution of the FG-Nups, is predicted to be negative close to pore walls and positive along the pore axis. The positive electrostatic potential facilitates the translocation of negatively charged particles, and the free energy barrier for translocation decreases for increasing particle hydrophobicity. These results agree with the experimental observation that transport receptors that form complexes with hydrophilic/neutral or positively charged proteins to transport them through the NPC are both hydrophobic and strongly negatively charged. The molecular theory shows that the effects of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions on the translocating potential are cooperative and nonequivalent due to the interaction-dependent reorganization of the FG-Nups in the presence of the translocating particle. The combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions can give rise to complex translocation potentials displaying a combination of wells and barriers, in contrast to the simple barrier potential observed for a hydrophilic/neutral translocating particle. This work demonstrates the importance of explicitly considering the amino acid sequence and hydrophobic, electrostatic, and steric interactions in understanding the translocation through the NPC.},

abstract = {Combined quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) approaches have become the method of choice for modeling reactions in biomolecular systems. Quantum-mechanical (QM) methods are required for describing chemical reactions and other electronic processes, such as charge transfer or electronic excitation. However, QM methods are restricted to systems of up to a few hundred atoms. However, the size and conformational complexity of biopolymers calls for methods capable of treating up to several 100,000 atoms and allowing for simulations over time scales of tens of nanoseconds. This is achieved by highly efficient, force-field-based molecular mechanics (MM) methods. Thus to model large biomolecules the logical approach is to combine the two techniques and to use a QM method for the chemically active region (e.g., substrates and co-factors in an enzymatic reaction) and an MM treatment for the surroundings (e.g., protein and solvent). The resulting schemes are commonly referred to as combined or hybrid QM/MM methods. They enable the modeling of reactive biomolecular systems at a reasonable computational effort while providing the necessary accuracy.},

The fundamental process operative in electroporation and electrofusion is treated in terms of a periodic lipid block model, a block being a nearest-neighbour pair of lipid molecules in either of two states: (i) the polar head group in the bilayer plane or (ii) facing the centre of a pore (or defect site). The number of blocks in the pore wall is the stochastic variable of the model describing pore size and stability. The Helmholtz free energy function characterizing the transition probabilities of the various pore states contains the surface energies of the pore wall and the planar bilayer and, if an electric field is present, also a dielectric polarization term (dominated by the polarization of the water layer adjacent to the pore wall). Assuming a Poisson process the average number of blocks in a pore wall is given by the solution of a non-linear differential equation. At subcritical electric fields the average pore size is stationary and very small. At supercritical field strengths the pore radius increases and, reaching a critical pore size, the membrane ruptures (dielectric breakdown). If, however, the electric field is switched off, before the critical pore radius is reached, the pore apparently completely reseals to the closed bilayer configuration (reversible electroporation ).},

Here we report that, in extracellular solution of low divalent cation concentration, the bovine AChR channel has a smaller conductance than the Torpedo AChR channel. Replacement of the delta-subunit of the Torpedo AChR by the bovine delta-subunit makes the channel conductance similar to that of the bovine AChR channel. To locate the region in the delta-subunit responsible for this difference, we have constructed chimaeric delta-subunit cDNAs with different combinations of the Torpedo and bovine counterparts. The conductances of AChR channels containing chimaeric delta-subunits suggest that a region comprising the putative transmembrane segment M2 and the adjacent bend portion between segments M2 and M3 is involved in determining the rate of ion transport through the open channel.},

abstract = {The GROMOS 54A8 force field [Reif et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput.2012, 8, 3705-3723] is the first of its kind to contain nonbonded parameters for charged amino acid side chains that are derived in a rigorously thermodynamic fashion, namely a calibration against single-ion hydration free energies. Considering charged moieties in solution, the most decisive signature of the GROMOS 54A8 force field in comparison to its predecessor 54A7 can probably be found in the thermodynamic equilibrium between salt-bridged ion pair formation and hydration. Possible shifts in this equilibrium might crucially affect the properties of electrolyte solutions or/and the stability of (bio)molecules. It is therefore important to investigate the consequences of the altered description of charged oligoatomic species in the GROMOS 54A8 force field. The present study focuses on examining the ability of the GROMOS 54A8 force field to accurately model the structural properties of electrolyte solutions, lipid bilayers, and proteins. It is found that (i) aqueous electrolytes involving oligoatomic species (sodium acetate, methylammonium chloride, guanidinium chloride) reproduce experimental salt activity derivatives for concentrations up to 1.0 m (1.0-molal) very well, and good agreement between simulated and experimental data is also reached for sodium acetate and methylammonium chloride at 2.0 m concentration, while not even qualitative agreement is found for sodium chloride throughout the whole range of examined concentrations, indicating a failure of the GROMOS 54A7 and 54A8 force-field parameter sets to correctly account for the balance between ion-ion and ion-water binding propensities of sodium and chloride ions; (ii) the GROMOS 54A8 force field reproduces the liquid crystalline-like phase of a hydrated DPPC bilayer at a pressure of 1 bar and a temperature of 323 K, the area per lipid being in agreement with experimental data, whereas other structural properties (volume per lipid, bilayer thickness) appear underestimated; (iii) the secondary structure of a range of different proteins simulated with the GROMOS 54A8 force field at pH 7 is maintained and compatible with experimental NMR data, while, as also observed for the GROMOS 54A7 force field, $\alpha$-helices are slightly overstabilized with respect to 3(10)-helices; (iv) with the GROMOS 54A8 force field, the side chains of arginine, lysine, aspartate, and glutamate residues appear slightly more hydrated and present a slight excess of oppositely-charged solution components in their vicinity, whereas salt-bridge formation properties between charged residues at the protein surface, as assessed by probability distributions of interionic distances, are largely equivalent in the GROMOS 54A7 and 54A8 force-field parameter sets.},

abstract = {Aquaporin water channels enable fast water transport while maintaining the resistance against protons and ions. We mimic this aquaporin with a rigid or flexible hourglass-shaped nanopore in our molecular dynamics simulation. The simulation was non-equilibrium one with applied uniform external forces with the purpose of mimicking osmosis-driven flows. The simplified computational model successfully captures the important physics of real aquaporin to confirm the validity of our flexible hourglass-shaped pore model. We also found that the hourglass-shaped pore has the ability to occupy more water molecules and conduct faster water transport than the straight pores with the pore diameter. We suggest that deforming straight nanopores into hourglass-shape may enhance the ability of water transport in thin membranes. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {All cells, including microbes, detect and respond to mechanical forces, of which osmotic pressure is most ancient and universal. Channel proteins have evolved such that they can be directly stretched open when the membrane is under turgor pressure. Osmotic downshock, as in rain, opens bacterial mechanosensitive (MS) channels to jettison osmolytes, relieving pressure and preventing cell lysis. The ion flux through individual channel proteins can be observed directly with a patch clamp. MS channels of large and small conductance (MscL and MscS, respectively) have been cloned, crystallized, and subjected to biophysical and genetic analyses in depth. They are now models to scrutinize how membrane forces direct protein conformational changes. Eukaryotic microbes have homologs from animal sensory channels of the TRP superfamily. The MS channel in yeast is also directly sensitive to membrane stretch. This review examines the key concept that proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer can respond to the changes in the mechanical environment the lipid bilayer provides.},

abstract = {Membrane proteins adopt two fundamental types of folds in nature: membranes in all organisms harbor $\alpha$-helical bundles linked by extramembranous loops of varying length, while $\beta$-barrel structures are found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. Here we report that turn-inducing loop mutations in a transmembrane hairpin induce the conversion of an $\alpha$-helical hairpin to $\beta$-sheet oligomers in membrane environments. On the basis of an observation of a sequence bias toward Pro and Gly in the turns of native $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins, we characterized in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayers several "hairpin" constructs of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator transmembrane segments 3 and 4 (TM3-loop-TM4; loop region being (215)IWELLQASA(223)) in which Pro-Gly residues were either inserted or substituted at several positions. Remarkably, suitable positioning of the Pro-Gly doublet caused the adoption of stable $\beta$-sheet structures by several mutants in SDS micelles, as shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy, concurrent with a ladder of discrete oligomers observed via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Reconstitution of wild-type (WT) TM3/4 into POPC vesicles studied by Trp fluorescence, in conjunction with positional quenchers in brominated phospholipids, indicated a transbilayer position for helical WT TM3/4, but likely a largely surface-embedded conformation for the $\beta$-sheet mutant with loop region IWPGELLQASA. To the best of our knowledge, such a complete change in the fold with a minimal number of mutations has not been previously observed for a membrane protein. These facile $\alpha$-helix to $\beta$-sheet conversions highlight the contribution of loops to membrane protein structure.},

Measurements of those transfer free energies will facilitate the identification of membrane protein sequences and aid in the understanding of how proteins interact with membranes during key biological events. We report the first water-to-bilayer transfer free energy scale (i.e., a "hydrophobicity scale") for the twenty natural amino acid side chains measured in the context of a native transmembrane protein and a phospholipid bilayer. Our measurements reveal parity for apolar side-chain contributions between soluble and membrane proteins and further demonstrate that an arginine side-chain placed near the middle of a lipid bilayer is accommodated with much less energetic cost than predicted by molecular dynamics simulations.},

abstract = {In membrane proteins, the extent to which polarity, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals packing interactions of the buried, internal residues direct protein folding and association of transmembrane segments is poorly understood. The energetics associated with these various interactions should differ substantially between membrane versus water-soluble proteins. To help evaluate these energetics, we have altered a water-soluble, two-stranded coiled-coil peptide to render its sequence soluble in membranes. The membrane-soluble peptide associates in a monomer-dimer-trimer equilibrium, in which the trimer predominates at the highest peptide/detergent ratios. The oligomers are stabilized by a buried Asn side chain. Mutation of this Asn to Val essentially eliminates oligomerization of the membrane-soluble peptide. Thus, within a membrane-like environment, interactions involving a polar Asn side chain provide a strong thermodynamic driving force for membrane helix association.},

Using the Escherichia coli mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS) as a model protein, we prepared membrane protein polyhedral nanoparticles (MPPNs) with uniform radii of ∼ 20 nm. Electron cryotomographic analysis established that these MPPNs contain 24 MscS heptamers related by octahedral symmetry. Subsequent single-particle electron cryomicroscopy yielded a reconstruction at ∼ 1-nm resolution, revealing a conformation closely resembling the nonconducting state. The generality of this approach has been addressed by the successful preparation of MPPNs for two unrelated proteins, the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance and the connexon Cx26, using a recently devised microfluidics-based free interface diffusion system. MPPNs provide not only a starting point for the structural analysis of membrane proteins in a phospholipid environment, but their closed surfaces should facilitate studies in the presence of physiological transmembrane gradients, in addition to potential applications as drug delivery carriers or as templates for inorganic nanoparticle formation.},

abstract = {A conserved heterotrimeric membrane protein complex, the Sec61 or SecY complex, forms a protein-conducting channel, allowing polypeptides to be transferred across or integrated into membranes. We report the crystal structure of the complex from Methanococcus jannaschii at a resolution of 3.2 A. The structure suggests that one copy of the heterotrimer serves as a functional translocation channel. The alpha-subunit has two linked halves, transmembrane segments 1-5 and 6-10, clamped together by the gamma-subunit. A cytoplasmic funnel leading into the channel is plugged by a short helix. Plug displacement can open the channel into an 'hourglass' with a ring of hydrophobic residues at its constriction. This ring may form a seal around the translocating polypeptide, hindering the permeation of other molecules. The structure also suggests mechanisms for signal-sequence recognition and for the lateral exit of transmembrane segments of nascent membrane proteins into lipid, and indicates binding sites for partners that provide the driving force for translocation.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the properties of pores formed by OmpF porin from Escherichia coli, based on a molecular dynamics simulation of the OmpF trimer, 318 palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine lipids, 27 Na+ ions, and 12,992 water molecules. After equilibration and a nanosecond production run, the OmpF trimer exhibits a C-alpha root mean square deviation from the crystal structure of 0.23 nm and a stable secondary structure. No evidence is found for large-scale motions of the L3 loop. We investigate the pore dimensions, conductance, and the properties of water inside the pore. This water forms a complicated pattern, even when averaged over 1 ns of simulation time. Around the pore constriction zone the water dipoles are highly structured in the plane of the membrane, oriented by the strong transversal electric field. In addition, there is a net orientation along the pore axis pointing from the extracellular to the intracellular side of the bilayer. The diffusion coefficients of water inside the pore are greatly reduced compared to bulk. We compare our results to results from model pores (Breed et al., 1996. Biophys. J. 70:1 643-1 661; Sansom et al. 1997. Biophys. J. 73:2404-241 5) and discuss implications for further theoretical work.},

abstract = {We present results of molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayers under a high transverse electrical field aimed at investigating their electroporation. Several systems are studied, namely 1), a bare bilayer, 2), a bilayer containing a peptide nanotube channel, and 3), a system with a peripheral DNA double strand. In all systems, the applied transmembrane electric fields (0.5 V.nm(-1) and 1.0 V.nm(-1)) induce an electroporation of the lipid bilayer manifested by the formation of water wires and water channels across the membrane. The internal structures of the peptide nanotube assembly and that of the DNA strand are hardly modified under field. For system 2, no perturbation of the membrane is witnessed at the vicinity of the channel, which indicates that the interactions of the peptide with the nearby lipids stabilize the bilayer. For system 3, the DNA strand migrates to the interior of the membrane only after electroporation. Interestingly enough, switching of the external transmembrane potential in cases 1 and 2 for few nanoseconds is enough to allow for complete resealing and reconstitution of the bilayer. We provide evidence that the electric field induces a significant lateral stress on the bilayer, manifested by surface tensions of magnitudes in the order of 1 mN.m(-1). This study is believed to capture the essence of several dynamical phenomena observed experimentally and provides a framework for further developments and for new applications.},

abstract = {We present a refined model of the membrane-associated Torpedo acetylcholine (ACh) receptor at 4 ?? resolution. An improved experimental density map was obtained from 342 electron images of helical tubes, and the refined structure was derived to an R-factor of 36.7% (R free 37.9%) by standard crystallographic methods, after placing the densities corresponding to a single molecule into an artificial unit cell. The agreement between experimental and calculated phases along the helical layer-lines was used to monitor progress in the refinement and to give an independent measure of the accuracy. The atomic model allowed a detailed description of the whole receptor in the closed-channel form, including the ligand-binding and intracellular domains, which have not previously been interpreted at a chemical level. We confirm that the two ligand-binding ?? subunits have a different extended conformation from the three other subunits in the closed channel, and identify several interactions on both pairs of subunit interfaces, and within the ?? subunits, which may be responsible for their "distorted" structures. The ACh-coordinating amino acid side-chains of the ?? subunits are far apart in the closed channel, indicating that a localised rearrangement, involving closure of loops B and C around the bound ACh molecule, occurs upon activation. A comparison of the structure of the ?? subunit with that of AChBP having ligand present, suggests how the localised rearrangement overcomes the distortions and initiates the rotational movements associated with opening of the channel. Both vestibules of the channel are strongly electronegative, providing a cation-stabilising environment at either entrance of the membrane pore. Access to the pore on the intracellular side is further influenced by narrow lateral windows, which would be expected to screen out electrostatically ions of the wrong charge and size. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

However, various issues will have to be resolved to make this approach practical, including controlling the DNA translocation rate, suppressing stochastic nucleobase motions, and resolving the signal overlap between different nucleobases. Here, we demonstrate theoretically the feasibility of DNA sequencing using a fluidic nanochannel functionalized with a graphene nanoribbon. This approach involves deciphering the changes that occur in the conductance of the nanoribbon as a result of its interactions with the nucleobases via $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking. We show that as a DNA strand passes through the nanochannel, the distinct conductance characteristics of the nanoribbon (calculated using a method based on density functional theory coupled to non-equilibrium Green function theory) allow the different nucleobases to be distinguished using a data-mining technique and a two-dimensional transient autocorrelation analysis. This fast and reliable DNA sequencing device should be experimentally feasible in the near future.},

abstract = {To understand the molecular mechanism of ion permeation in pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGIC), we solved the structure of an open form of GLIC, a prokaryotic pLGIC, at 2.4 \AA. Anomalous diffraction data were used to place bound anions and cations. This reveals ordered water molecules at the level of two rings of hydroxylated residues (named Ser6' and Thr2') that contribute to the ion selectivity filter. Two water pentagons are observed, a self-stabilized ice-like water pentagon and a second wider water pentagon, with one sodium ion between them. Single-channel electrophysiology shows that the side-chain hydroxyl of Ser6' is crucial for ion translocation. Simulations and electrostatics calculations complemented the description of hydration in the pore and suggest that the water pentagons observed in the crystal are important for the ion to cross hydrophobic constriction barriers. Simulations that pull a cation through the pore reveal that residue Ser6' actively contributes to ion translocation by reorienting its side chain when the ion is going through the pore. Generalization of these findings to the pLGIC family is proposed.},

In the present work, steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation was used to explore the possibility of penetration of a polar drug, paclitaxel (PTX), encapsulated inside the CNT, through a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer membrane. The interactions between PTX and CNT and between PTX and the confined water molecules inside the CNT had a significant effect on the penetration process of PTX. The results reveal that the presence of a PTX molecule increases the magnitude of the pulling force. The effect of pulling velocity on the penetration mechanism was also investigated by a series of SMD simulations, and it is shown that the pulling velocity had a significant effect on pulling force and the interaction between lipid bilayer and drug molecule.},

abstract = {The porins PhoE and OmpF form anion and cation-selective pores, respectively, in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. Each monomer of these trimeric proteins consists of a 16-stranded beta-barrel, which contains a constriction at half the height of the channel. The functional significance of a transverse electrical field that is formed by charged amino acid residues within the constriction zone was investigated. For this purpose, the PhoE residues R37, R75, K18 and E110 were substituted by neutral amino acids. The mutant pores allowed an increased permeation of beta-lactam antibiotics across the outer membrane in vivo, although the single channel conductance, measured in planar lipid bilayers, was not increased or even slightly decreased. Replacement of the positively charged residues resulted in a decreased voltage sensitivity, whereas the substitution of a negatively charged residue resulted in an increased voltage sensitivity. Similar substitutions in OmpF caused the opposite effects, i.e. the substitution of positive and negative charges resulted in increased and decreased voltage sensitivity, respectively. Together, the results suggest that opposite charges, i.e. positive charges in anion-selective and negative charges in cation-selective porins, act as sensors for voltage gating.},

abstract = {New protein parameters are reported for the all-atom empirical energy function in the CHARMM program:. The parameter evaluation was based on a self-consistent approach designed to achieve a balance between the internal (bonding) and interaction (nonbonding) terms of the force field and among the solvent-solvent, solvent-solute, and solute-solute interactions. Optimization of the internal parameters used experimental gas-phase geometries, vibrational spectra, and torsional energy surfaces supplemented with ab initio results. The peptide backbone bonding parameters were optimized with respect to data for N-methylacetamide and; the alanine dipeptide. The interaction parameters, particularly the atomic charges, were determined by fitting ab initio interaction energies and geometries of complexes between water and model compounds that represented the backbone and the various side chains. In addition: dipole moments, experimental heats and free energies of vaporization, solvation and sublimation, molecular volumes, and crystal pressures and structures were used in the optimization. The resulting protein parameters were tested by applying them to noncyclic tripeptide crystals, cyclic peptide crystals, and the proteins crambin, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and carbonmonoxy myoglobin in vacuo and in crystals. A detailed analysis of the relationship between the alanine dipeptide potential energy surface and calculated protein phi, chi angles was made and used in optimizing the peptide group torsional parameters. The results demonstrate that use of ab initio structural and energetic data by themselves are not sufficient to obtain an adequate backbone representation for peptides and proteins in solution and in crystals. Extensive comparisons between molecular dynamics simulations and experimental data for polypeptides and proteins were performed for both structural and dynamic properties. Energy minimization and dynamics simulations for crystals demonstrate that the latter are needed to obtain meaningful comparisons with experimental crystal structures. The presented parameters, in combination with the previously published CHARMM all-atom parameters for nucleic acids and lipids, provide a consistent set for condensed-phase simulations of a wide variety of molecules of biological interest.},

The wings provide a model for the development of novel functional surfaces that possess an increased resistance to bacterial contamination and infection. We propose a biophysical model of the interactions between bacterial cells and cicada wing surface structures, and show that mechanical properties, in particular cell rigidity, are key factors in determining bacterial resistance/sensitivity to the bactericidal nature of the wing surface. We confirmed this experimentally by decreasing the rigidity of surface-resistant strains through microwave irradiation of the cells, which renders them susceptible to the wing effects. Our findings demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating cicada wing nanopatterns into the design of antibacterial nanomaterials.},

abstract = {Free energy simulations using a finite sphere boundary condition rather than a periodic boundary condition (PBC) are attractive in the study of very large biomolecular systems. To understand the quantitative impact of various approximations in such simulations, we compare charging free energies in both solution and protein systems calculated in a linear response framework with the Generalized Solvent Boundary Potential (GSBP) and PBC simulations. For simple ions in solution, we find good agreements between GSBP and PBC charging free energies, once the relevant correction terms are taken into consideration. For PBC simulations with the particle-mesh-Ewald for long-range electrostatics, the contribution ($\Delta$G(P-M)) due to the use of a particle rather than molecule based summation scheme in real space is found to be significant, as pointed out by H\"{u}nenberger and co-workers. For GSBP, when the inner region is close to be charge neutral, the key correction is the overpolarization of water molecules at the inner/outer dielectric boundary; the magnitude of the correction ($\Delta$G(s-pol)), however, is relatively small. For charging (oxidation) free energy in proteins, the situation is more complex, although good agreement between GSBP and PBC can still be obtained when care is exercised. The smooth dielectric boundary approximation inherent to GSBP tends to make significant errors when the inner region is featured with a high net charge. However, the error can be corrected with Poisson-Boltzmann calculations using snapshots from GSBP simulations in a straightforward and robust manner. Because of the more complex charge and solvent distributions, the magnitudes of $\Delta$G(P-M) and $\Delta$G(s-pol) in protein simulations appear to be different from those derived for solution simulations, leading to uncertainty in directly comparing absolute charging free energies from PBC and GSBP simulations for protein systems. The relative charging/oxidation free energies, however, are robust. With the linear response approximation, for the specific protein system (CueR) studied, the effect of freezing the protein structure in the outer region is found to be small, unless a very small (8 \AA) inner region is used; even in the latter case, the result is substantially improved when the nearby metal binding loop is allowed to respond to metal oxidation. The implications of these results to the applicability of GSBP to complex biomolecules and in ab initio QM/MM simulations are discussed.},

@article{Meyer2006,
abstract = {We present here a brief review of direct force measurements between hydrophobic surfaces in aqueous solutions. For almost 70 years, researchers have attempted to understand the hydrophobic effect (the low solubility of hydrophobic solutes in water) and the hydrophobic interaction or force (the unusually strong attraction of hydrophobic surfaces and groups in water). After many years of research into how hydrophobic interactions affect the thermodynamic properties of processes such as micelle formation (self-assembly) and protein folding, the results of direct force measurements between macroscopic surfaces began to appear in the 1980s. Reported ranges of the attraction between variously prepared hydrophobic surfaces in water grew from the initially reported value of 80-100 Angstrom to values as large as 3,000 Angstrom. Recent improved surface preparation techniques and the combination of surface force apparatus measurements with atomic force microscopy imaging have made it possible to explain the long-range part of this interaction (at separations >200 Angstrom) that is observed between certain surfaces. We tentatively conclude that only the short-range part of the attraction (<100 Angstrom) represents the true hydrophobic interaction, although a quantitative explanation for this interaction will require additional research. Although our force-measuring technique did not allow collection of reliable data at separations <10 Angstrom, it is clear that some stronger force must act in this regime if the measured interaction energy curve is to extrapolate to the measured adhesion energy as the surface separation approaches zero (i.e., as the surfaces come into molecular contact).},

The pore is shaped by an inner ring of 5 alpha-helices, which curve radially to create a tapering path for the ions, and an outer ring of 15 alpha-helices, which coil around each other and shield the inner ring from the lipids. The gate is a constricting hydrophobic girdle at the middle of the lipid bilayer, formed by weak interactions between neighbouring inner helices. When acetylcholine enters the ligand-binding domain, it triggers rotations of the protein chains on opposite sides of the entrance to the pore. These rotations are communicated through the inner helices, and open the pore by breaking the girdle apart.},

We show that a single-walled carbon nanotube demonstrates oscillations in electroosmotic current through its interior at specific ranges of electric field that are the signatures of coherence resonance. Stochastic pore blocking is observed when individual cations partition into the nanotube obstructing an otherwise stable proton current. The observed oscillations occur because of coupling between pore blocking and a proton-diffusion limitation at the pore mouth. The result illustrates how simple ionic transport can generate coherent waveforms within an inherently noisy environment and points to new types of nanoreactors, sensors, and nanofluidic channels based on this platform.},

abstract = {Lactose permease (LacY) is the prototype of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of secondary transporters. Available structures of LacY reveal a state in which the substrate is exposed to the cytoplasm but is occluded from the periplasm. However, the alternating-access transport mechanism requires the existence of a periplasm-facing state. We recently showed that inverted-topology structural repeats provide the foundation for the mechanisms of two transporter families with folds distinct from the MFS. Here, we generated a structural model of LacY by swapping the conformations of inverted-topology repeats identified in its two domains. The model exhibits all required properties of an outward-facing conformation (i.e., closure of the binding site to the cytoplasm and exposure to the periplasm). Furthermore, the model agrees with double electron-electron resonance distance changes, accessibility to cysteine-modifying reagents, cysteine cross-linking data, and a recent structure of a distantly related transporter. Analysis of the intradomain differences between the two states suggests a role for conserved sequence motifs in occluding the central pathway through kinking of the pore-lining helices. In addition, predicted re-pairing of critical salt-bridging residues in the binding sites agrees remarkably well with previous proposals, allowing a description of the proton/sugar transport mechanism. More fundamentally, our model demonstrates that inverted-topology repeats provide the foundation for the alternating-access mechanisms of MFS transporters.},

This explains the difference between the experimentally observed critical field strengths requested to trigger the processes of permeabilization and fusion. The critical membrane potential difference which induces membrane permeabilization can be calculated from these experimental observations. It is observed that its value is always about 200 mV for many different cell systems as we previously reported in the case of pure lipid vesicles. This is much less than assumed in most previous studies.},

Here we present the crystal structure of a TMEM16 family member from the fungus Nectria haematococca that operates as a Ca(2+)-activated lipid scramblase.

This cavity harbours a conserved Ca(2+)-binding site located within the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Mutations of residues involved in Ca(2+) coordination affect both lipid scrambling in N. haematococca TMEM16 and ion conduction in the Cl(-) channel TMEM16A. The structure reveals the general architecture of the family and its mode of Ca(2+) activation. It also provides insight into potential scrambling mechanisms and serves as a framework to unravel the conduction of ions in certain TMEM16 proteins.},

abstract = {Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are the major outer surface membrane components present in almost all Gram-negative bacteria and act as extremely strong stimulators of innate or natural immunity in diverse eukaryotic species ranging from insects to humans. LPS consist of a poly- or oligosaccharide region that is anchored in the outer bacterial membrane by a specific carbohydrate lipid moiety termed lipid A. The lipid A component is the primary immunostimulatory centre of LPS. With respect to immunoactivation in mammalian systems, the classical group of strongly agonistic (highly endotoxic) forms of LPS has been shown to be comprised of a rather similar set of lipid A types. In addition, several natural or derivatised lipid A structures have been identified that display comparatively low or even no immunostimulation for a given mammalian species. Some members of the latter more heterogeneous group are capable of antagonizing the effects of strongly stimulatory LPS/lipid A forms. Agonistic forms of LPS or lipid A trigger numerous physiological immunostimulatory effects in mammalian organisms, but--in higher doses--can also lead to pathological reactions such as the induction of septic shock. Cells of the myeloid lineage have been shown to be the primary cellular sensors for LPS in the mammalian immune system. During the past decade, enormous progress has been obtained in the elucidation of the central LPS/lipid A recognition and signaling system in mammalian phagocytes. According to the current model, the specific cellular recognition of agonistic LPS/lipid A is initialized by the combined extracellular actions of LPS binding protein (LBP), the membrane-bound or soluble forms of CD14 and the newly identified Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)*MD-2 complex, leading to the rapid activation of an intracellular signaling network that is highly homologous to the signaling systems of IL-1 and IL-18. The elucidation of structure-activity correlations in LPS and lipid A has not only contributed to a molecular understanding of both immunostimulatory and toxic septic processes, but has also re-animated the development of new pharmacological and immunostimulatory strategies for the prevention and therapy of infectious and malignant diseases.},

abstract = {pLGICs (pentameric ligand-gated ion channels) are a family of structurally homologous cation and anion channels involved in neurotransmission. Cation-selective members of the pLGIC family are typically inhibited by general anaesthetics, whereas anion-selective members are potentiated. GLIC is a prokaryotic cation pLGIC and can be inhibited by clinical concentrations of general anaesthetics. The introduction of three mutations, Y221A (Y-3'A), E222P (E-2'P) and N224R (N0'R), at the selectivity filter and one, A237T (A13'T), at the hydrophobic gate, converted GLIC into an anion channel. The mutated GLIC (GLIC4) became insensitive to the anaesthetics propofol and etomidate, as well as the channel blocker picrotoxin. MD (molecular dynamics) simulations revealed changes in the structure and dynamics of GLIC4 in comparison with GLIC, particularly in the tilting angles of the pore-lining helix [TM2 (transmembrane helix 2)] that consequently resulted in different pore radius and hydration profiles. Propofol binding to an intra-subunit site of GLIC shifted the tilting angles of TM2 towards closure at the hydrophobic gate region, consistent with propofol inhibition of GLIC. In contrast, the pore of GLIC4 was much more resilient to perturbation from propofol binding. The present study underscores the importance of pore dynamics and conformation to anaesthetic effects on channel functions.},

Helical microtubules of graphitic carbon Nature. 1991; 354:56–8), carbon nanotubes have been the focus of considerable research. Numerous investigators have since reported remarkable physical and mechanical properties for this new form of carbon. From unique electronic properties and a thermal conductivity higher than diamond to mechanical properties where the stiffness, strength and resilience exceeds any current material, carbon nanotubes offer tremendous opportunities for the development of fundamentally new material systems. In particular, the exceptional mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes, combined with their low density, offer scope for the development of nanotube-reinforced composite materials. The potential for nanocomposites reinforced with carbon tubes having extraordinary specific stiffness and strength represent tremendous opportunity for application in the 21st century. This paper provides a concise review of recent advances in carbon nanotubes and their composites. We examine the research work reported in the literature on the structure and processing of carbon nanotubes, as well as characterization and property modeling of carbon nanotubes and their composites.},

abstract = {As the beneficial effects of curcumin have often been reported to be limited to its small concentrations, we have undertaken a study to find the aggregation properties of curcumin in water by varying the number of monomers. Our molecular dynamics simulation results show that the equilibrated structure is always an aggregated state with remarkable structural rearrangements as we vary the number of curcumin monomers from 4 to 16 monomers. We find that curcumin monomers form clusters in a very definite pattern where they tend to aggregate both in parallel and anti-parallel orientation of the phenyl rings, often seen in the formation of beta-sheet in proteins. A considerable enhancement in the population of parallel alignments is observed with increasing the system size from 12 to 16 curcumin monomers. Due to the prevalence of such parallel alignment for large system size, a more closely packed cluster is formed with maximum number of hydrophobic contacts. We also follow the pathway of cluster growth, in particular the transition from the initial segregated to the final aggregated state. We find the existence of a metastable structural intermediate involving a number of intermediate-sized clusters dispersed in the solution. The course of aggregation bears similarity to nucleation and growth in highly metastable state. The final aggregated form remains stable with total exclusion of water from its sequestered hydrophobic core. We also investigate water structure near the cluster surface along with their orientation. We find that water molecules form a distorted tetrahedral geometry in the 1st solvation layer of the cluster, interacting strongly with hydrophilic groups at the surface of curcumin. The dynamics of such quasi-bound water molecules near the surface of curcumin cluster is considerably slower than the bulk signifying a restricted motion as often found in protein hydration layer.},

abstract = {N-Acetylneuraminic acid lyase (NAL) is a Class I aldolase that catalyzes the reversible condensation of pyruvate with N-acetyl-d-mannosamine (ManNAc) to yield the sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). Aldolases are finding increasing use as biocatalysts for the stereospecific synthesis of complex molecules. Incomplete understanding of the mechanism of catalysis in aldolases, however, can hamper development of new enzyme activities and specificities, including control over newly generated stereocenters. In the case of NAL, it is clear that the enzyme catalyzes a Bi-Uni ordered condensation reaction in which pyruvate binds first to the enzyme to form a catalytically important Schiff base. The identity of the residues required for catalysis of the condensation step and the nature of the transition state for this reaction, however, have been a matter of conjecture. In order to address, this we crystallized a Y137A variant of the E. coli NAL in the presence of Neu5Ac. The three-dimensional structure shows a full length sialic acid bound in the active site of subunits A, B, and D, while in subunit C, discontinuous electron density reveals the positions of enzyme-bound pyruvate and ManNAc. These 'snapshot' structures, representative of intermediates in the enzyme catalytic cycle, provided an ideal starting point for QM/MM modeling of the enzymic reaction of carbon-carbon bond formation. This revealed that Tyr137 acts as the proton donor to the aldehyde oxygen of ManNAc during the reaction, the activation barrier is dominated by carbon-carbon bond formation, and proton transfer from Tyr137 is required to obtain a stable Neu5Ac-Lys165 Schiff base complex. The results also suggested that a triad of residues, Tyr137, Ser47, and Tyr110 from a neighboring subunit, are required to correctly position Tyr137 for its function, and this was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. This understanding of the mechanism and geometry of the transition states along the C-C bond-forming pathway will allow further development of these enzymes for stereospecific synthesis of new enzyme products.},

abstract = {The lipidic cubic phase method for crystallizing membrane proteins has posted some high-profile successes recently. This is especially true in the area of G-protein-coupled receptors, with six new crystallographic structures emerging in the last 3½ years. Slowly, it is becoming an accepted method with a proven record and convincing generality. However, it is not a method that is used in every membrane structural biology laboratory and that is unfortunate. The reluctance in adopting it is attributable, in part, to the anticipated difficulties associated with handling the sticky viscous cubic mesophase in which crystals grow. Harvesting and collecting diffraction data with the mesophase-grown crystals is also viewed with some trepidation. It is acknowledged that there are challenges associated with the method. However, over the years, we have worked to make the method user-friendly. To this end, tools for handling the mesophase in the pico- to nano-litre volume range have been developed for efficient crystallization screening in manual and robotic modes. Glass crystallization plates have been built that provide unparalleled optical quality and sensitivity to nascent crystals. Lipid and precipitant screens have been implemented for a more rational approach to crystallogenesis, such that the method can now be applied to a wide variety of membrane protein types and sizes. In the present article, these assorted advances are outlined, along with a summary of the membrane proteins that have yielded to the method. The challenges that must be overcome to develop the method further are described.},

The success of antibacterial agents depends upon their interaction with bacterial membranes, yet little is known about the molecular-level interactions within membranes of different bacterial species. To address this, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of two bacterial membranes: the outer membrane of E. coli and the cell membrane of S. aureus . We have retained the chemical complexity of the membranes by considering the details of their lipidic components. We identify the extended network of lipid-lipid interactions that stabilize the membranes. Our simulations of electroporation show that the S. aureus cell membrane is less resistant to poration than the E. coli outer membrane. The mechanisms of poration for the two membranes have subtle differences; for the E. coli outer membrane, relative differences in mobilities of the lipids of both leaflets are key in the process of poration.},

abstract = {Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) are potent cytolytic agents secreted by pathogenic bacteria that protect microbes against the cell-mediated immune system (by targeting phagocytic cells), disrupt epithelial barriers, and liberate materials necessary to sustain growth and colonization. Produced by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria alike, PFTs are released as water-soluble monomeric or dimeric species, bind specifically to target membranes, and assemble transmembrane channels leading to cell damage and/or lysis. Structural and biophysical analyses of individual steps in the assembly pathway are essential to fully understanding the dynamic process of channel formation. To work toward this goal, we solved by X-ray diffraction the 2.9-Å structure of the 450-kDa heptameric Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (VCC) toxin purified and crystallized in the presence of detergent. This structure, together with our previously determined 2.3-Å structure of the VCC water-soluble monomer, reveals in detail the architectural changes that occur within the channel region and accessory lectin domains during pore formation including substantial rearrangements of hydrogen-bonding networks in the pore-forming amphipathic loops. Interestingly, a ring of tryptophan residues forms the narrowest constriction in the transmembrane channel reminiscent of the phenylalanine clamp identified in anthrax protective antigen [Krantz BA, et al. (2005) Science 309:777-781]. Our work provides an example of a $\beta$-barrel PFT ($\beta$-PFT) for which soluble and assembled structures are available at high-resolution, providing a template for investigating intermediate steps in assembly.},

abstract = {In most members of the Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella, the lipopolysaccharide core oligosaccharide backbone is modified by phosphoryl groups. The negative charges provided by these residues are important in maintaining the barrier function of the outer membrane. Mutants lacking the core heptose region and the phosphate residues display pleiotrophic defects collectively known as the deep-rough phenotype, characterized by changes in outer membrane structure and function. Klebsiella pneumoniae lacks phosphoryl residues in its core, but instead contains galacturonic acid. The goal of this study was to determine the contribution of galacturonic acid as a critical source of negative charge. A mutant was created lacking all galacturonic acid by targeting UDP-galacturonic acid precursor synthesis through a mutation in gla(KP). Gla(KP) is a K. pneumoniae UDP-galacturonic acid C4 epimerase providing UDP-galacturonic acid for core synthesis. The gla(KP) gene was inactivated and the structure of the mutant lipopolysaccharide was determined by mass spectrometry. The mutant displayed characteristics of a deep-rough phenotype, exhibiting a hypersensitivity to hydrophobic compounds and polymyxin B, an altered outer membrane profile, and the release of the periplasmic enzyme beta-lactamase. These results indicate that the negative charge provided by the carboxyl groups of galacturonic acid do play an equivalent role to the core oligosaccharide phosphate residues in establishing outer membrane integrity in E. coli and Salmonella.},

abstract = {Achieving a fast, unidirectional flow of single-file water molecules (UFSWM) across nanochannels is important for membrane-based water purification or seawater desalination. For this purpose, electro-osmosis methods are recognized as a very promising approach and have been extensively discussed in the literature. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, here we propose a design for pumping water molecules in a single-walled carbon nanotube in the presence of a linearly gradient electric (GE) field. Such a GE field is inspired by GE fields generated from charged ions located adjacent to biological membrane water nanochannels that can conduct water in and out of cells and can be experimentally achieved by using the charged tip of an atomic force microscope. As a result, the maximum speed of the UFSWM can be 1 or 2 orders of magnitude larger than that in a uniform electric (UE) field. Also, inverse transportation of water molecules does not exist in case of the GE field but can appear for the UE field. Thus, the GE field yields a much more efficient UFSWM than the UE field. The giant pumping ability as revealed is attributed to the nonzero net electrostatic force acting on each water molecule confined in the nanotube. These observations have significance for the design of nanoscale devices for readily achieving controllable UFSWM at high speed.},

abstract = {Potassium (i.e., K(+)) channels allow for the controlled and selective passage of potassium ions across the plasma membrane via a conserved pore domain. In voltage-gated K(+) channels, gating is the result of the coordinated action of two coupled gates: an activation gate at the intracellular entrance of the pore and an inactivation gate at the selectivity filter. By using solid-state NMR structural studies, in combination with electrophysiological experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the turret region connecting the outer transmembrane helix (transmembrane helix 1) and the pore helix behind the selectivity filter contributes to K(+) channel inactivation and exhibits a remarkable structural plasticity that correlates to K(+) channel inactivation. The transmembrane helix 1 unwinds when the K(+) channel enters the inactivated state and rewinds during the transition to the closed state. In addition to well-characterized changes at the K(+) ion coordination sites, this process is accompanied by conformational changes within the turret region and the pore helix. Further spectroscopic and computational results show that the same channel domain is critically involved in establishing functional contacts between pore domain and the cellular membrane. Taken together, our results suggest that the interaction between the K(+) channel turret region and the lipid bilayer exerts an important influence on the selective passage of potassium ions via the K(+) channel pore.},

abstract = {The outer membrane protein G (OmpG) is a monomeric 33 kDa 14-stranded $\beta$-barrel membrane protein functioning as a nonspecific porin for the uptake of oligosaccharides in Escherichia coli. Two different crystal structures of OmpG obtained at different values of pH suggest a pH-gated pore opening mechanism. In these structures, extracellular loop 6 extends away from the barrel wall at neutral pH but is folded back into the pore lumen at low pH, blocking transport through the pore. Loop 6 was invisible in a previously published solution NMR structure of OmpG in n-dodecylphosphocholine micelles, presumably due to conformational exchange on an intermediate NMR time scale. Here we present an NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE)-based approach to visualize the conformational dynamics of loop 6 and to calculate conformational ensembles that explain the pH-gated opening and closing of the OmpG channel. The different loop conformers detected by the PRE ensemble calculations were validated by disulfide cross-linking of strategically engineered cysteines and electrophysiological single channel recordings. The results indicate a more dynamically regulated channel opening and closing than previously thought and reveal additional membrane-associated conformational ensembles at pH 6.3 and 7.0. We anticipate this approach to be generally applicable to detect and characterize functionally important conformational ensembles of membrane proteins.},

abstract = {Many proteins reside at the cell poles in rod-shaped bacteria. Several hypotheses have drawn a connection between protein localization and the large cell-wall curvature at the poles. One hypothesis has centered on the formation of microdomains of the lipid cardiolipin (CL), its localization to regions of high membrane curvature, and its interaction with membrane-associated proteins. A lack of experimental techniques has left this hypothesis unanswered. This paper describes a microtechnology-based technique for manipulating bacterial membrane curvature and quantitatively measuring its effect on the localization of CL and proteins in cells. We confined Escherichia coli spheroplasts in microchambers with defined shapes that were embossed into a layer of polymer and observed that the shape of the membrane deformed predictably to accommodate the walls of the microchambers. Combining this technique with epifluorescence microscopy and quantitative image analyses, we characterized the localization of CL microdomains in response to E. coli membrane curvature. CL microdomains localized to regions of high intrinsic negative curvature imposed by microchambers. We expressed a chimera of yellow fluorescent protein fused to the N-terminal region of MinD-a spatial determinant of E. coli division plane assembly-in spheroplasts and observed its colocalization with CL to regions of large, negative membrane curvature. Interestingly, the distribution of MinD was similar in spheroplasts derived from a CL synthase knockout strain. These studies demonstrate the curvature dependence of CL in membranes and test whether these structures participate in the localization of MinD to regions of negative curvature in cells.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs), which mediate chemo-electric signal transduction in animals, have been recently found in bacteria. Despite clear sequence and 3D structure homology, the phylogenetic distance between prokaryotic and eukaryotic homologs suggests significant structural divergences, especially at the interface between the extracellular (ECD) and the transmembrane (TMD) domains. To challenge this possibility, we constructed a chimera in which the ECD of the bacterial protein GLIC is fused to the TMD of the human 1 glycine receptor (1GlyR). Electrophysiology in Xenopus oocytes shows that it functions as a proton-gated ion channel, thereby locating the proton activation site(s) of GLIC in its ECD. Patch-clamp experiments in BHK cells show that the ion channel displays an anionic selectivity with a unitary conductance identical to that of the 1GlyR. In addition, pharmacological investigations result in transmembrane allosteric modulation similar to the one observed on 1GlyR. Indeed, the clinically active drugs propofol, four volatile general anesthetics, alcohols, and ivermectin all potentiate the chimera while they inhibit GLIC. Collectively, this work shows the compatibility between GLIC and 1GlyR domains and points to conservation of the ion channel and transmembrane allosteric regulatory sites in the chimera. This provides evidence that GLIC and 1GlyR share a highly homologous 3D structure. GLIC is thus a relevant model of eukaryotic pLGICs, at least from the anionic type. In addition, the chimera is a good candidate for mass production in Escherichia coli, opening the way for investigations of "druggable" eukaryotic allosteric sites by X-ray crystallography.},

In silico hits against a set of anti-targets (i.e., proteins or nucleic acids that are off-targets from the desired pharmaceutical target objective) are used to predict a simple, visual measure of possible interactions for the ligands, which helped to introduce early safety considerations into the design of compounds before lead optimization. This combined approach consists of consensus docking and scoring: cross-docking to a group of wild-type and drug resistant mutant proteins; ligand efficiency (also called binding efficiency) indices as new ranking measures; pre- and post-docking filters; as well as a set of anti-targets and estimation, and minimization of atomic clashes. Diverse, small molecule compounds with new chemistry (such as a triazine core with aromatic sidechains) as well as known drugs for different applications (oxazepam, chlorthalidone) were highly ranked to the targets having similar binding interactions and functional group spatial arrangement as known inhibitors, while being moderate to low binders to the anti-targets. The results are discussed based on their relevance to medicinal and computational chemistry. Optimization of ligands to targets and off- or anti-targets is foreseen to be critical for compounds directed at several simultaneous sites.},

This structural information together with molecular dynamics simulations, suggests a mechanism whereby extracellular events may be transmitted through the membrane and influence DAP12 signaling. We demonstrate that CLEC5A is homodimeric and binds to dengue virus serotypes 1-4. Using blotting experiments, surface analyses and docking studies, we investigate the interaction of CLEC5A with dengue virus, mannose, fucose and associated sugars and highlight three distinct potential ligand binding sites.

It dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) upon membrane depolarization. The cytoplasmic region is composed of a phosphatase domain (PD) and a putatively membrane-interaction domain, C2. Here we determined the crystal structures of the Ci-VSP cytoplasmic region in three distinct constructs, wild-type (248-576), wild-type (236-576) and G365A mutant (248-576). The crystal structure of WT-236 and G365A-248 had the disulfide bond between the catalytic residue Cys363 and the adjacent residue Cys310. On the other hand, the disulfide bond was not present in the crystal structure of WT-248. These suggest the possibility that Ci-VSP is regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) as found in PTEN. These structures also revealed that the conformation of the TI loop in the active site of Ci-VSP cytoplasmic region was distinct from the corresponding region of PTEN: Ci-VSP has glutamic acid (Glu411) in the TI loop, orienting toward the center of active site pocket. Mutation of Glu411 led to acquirement of increased activity toward PtdIns(3,5)P2, suggesting that this site is required for determining substrate specificity. Our results provide the basic information of the enzymatic mechanism of Ci-VSP.},

Different initial structures and substrate binding configurations were used to probe the pathways of AK conformational change in explicit solvent, and no bias potential was applied. A complete closed-to-open and a partial open-to-closed transition were observed, demonstrating the direct impact of substrate-mediated interactions on shifting protein conformation. The sampled configurations suggest two possible pathways for connecting the open and closed structures of AK, affirming the prediction made based on available x-ray structures and earlier works of coarse-grained modeling. The trajectories of the all-atom molecular-dynamics simulations revealed the complexity of protein dynamics and the coupling between different domains during conformational change. Calculations of solvent density and density fluctuations surrounding AK did not show prominent variation during the transition between closed and open forms. Finally, we characterized the effects of local unfolding of an important hinge near Pro(177) on the closed-to-open transition of AK and identified a novel mechanism by which hinge unfolding modulates protein conformational change. The local unfolding of Pro(177) hinge induces alternative tertiary contacts that stabilize the closed structure and prevent the opening transition.},

abstract = {Antibody VRC01 is a human immunoglobulin that neutralizes $\sim$90% of HIV-1 isolates. To understand how such broadly neutralizing antibodies develop, we used x-ray crystallography and 454 pyrosequencing to characterize additional VRC01-like antibodies from HIV-1-infected individuals. Crystal structures revealed a convergent mode of binding for diverse antibodies to the same CD4-binding-site epitope. A functional genomics analysis of expressed heavy and light chains revealed common pathways of antibody-heavy chain maturation, confined to the IGHV1-2*02 lineage, involving dozens of somatic changes, and capable of pairing with different light chains. Broadly neutralizing HIV-1 immunity associated with VRC01-like antibodies thus involves the evolution of antibodies to a highly affinity-matured state required to recognize an invariant viral structure, with lineages defined from thousands of sequences providing genetic roadmaps of their development.},

Several structures of mostly detergent-solubilized Sec complexes have been reported. Here we present a single-particle cryo-EM structure of the SecYEG complex in a membrane environment, bound to a translating ribosome, at subnanometer resolution. Using the SecYEG complex reconstituted in a so-called Nanodisc, we could trace the nascent polypeptide chain from the peptidyltransferase center into the membrane. The reconstruction allowed for the identification of ribosome-lipid interactions. The rRNA helix 59 (H59) directly contacts the lipid surface and appears to modulate the membrane in immediate vicinity to the proposed lateral gate of the protein-conducting channel (PCC). On the basis of our map and molecular dynamics simulations, we present a model of a signal anchor-gated PCC in the membrane.},

abstract = {The GXGD proteases are polytopic membrane proteins with catalytic activities against membrane-spanning substrates that require a pair of aspartyl residues. Representative members of the family include preflagellin peptidase, type 4 prepilin peptidase, presenilin and signal peptide peptidase. Many GXGD proteases are important in medicine. For example, type 4 prepilin peptidase may contribute to bacterial pathogenesis, and mutations in presenilin are associated with Alzheimer's disease. As yet, there is no atomic-resolution structure in this protease family. Here we report the crystal structure of FlaK, a preflagellin peptidase from Methanococcus maripaludis, solved at 3.6 \AA resolution. The structure contains six transmembrane helices. The GXGD motif and a short transmembrane helix, helix 4, are positioned at the centre, surrounded by other transmembrane helices. The crystal structure indicates that the protease must undergo conformational changes to bring the GXGD motif and a second essential aspartyl residue from transmembrane helix 1 into close proximity for catalysis. A comparison of the crystal structure with models of presenilin derived from biochemical analysis reveals three common transmembrane segments that are similarly arranged around the active site. This observation reinforces the idea that the prokaryotic and human proteases are evolutionarily related. The crystal structure presented here provides a framework for understanding the mechanism of the GXGD proteases, and may facilitate the rational design of inhibitors that target specific members of the family.},

The F2 and F3 subdomains of the talin head play a key role in formation of this complex. Here, activation of the integrin IIb/{beta}3 dimer by the talin head domain was probed using multiscale molecular dynamics simulations. A number of novel insights emerge from these studies, including (i) the importance of the integrin IIb subunit F992 and F993 residues in stabilizing the "off" state of the IIb/{beta}3 dimer, (ii) a crucial role for negatively charged groups in the F2-F3/membrane interaction, (iii) binding of the talin F2-F3 domain to negatively charged lipid headgroups in the membrane induces a reorientation of the {beta} transmembrane (TM) domain, (iv) an increase in the tilt angle of the {beta} TM domain relative to the bilayer normal helps to destabilize the /{beta} TM interaction and promote a scissor-like movement of the integrin TM helices. These results, combined with various published experimental observations, suggest a model for the mechanism of inside-out activation of integrins by talin.},

Here, we critically examine the statistical convergence of equilibrium properties in molecular simulations of two amino acid side-chain analogs, leucine and arginine, in the presence of a hydrated phospholipid bilayer. To this end, the convergence of the standard binding free energy for the reversible insertion of the solutes in the bilayer is systematically assessed by evaluating dozens of separate sets of umbrella sampling calculations for a total simulation time exceeding 400 ?s. We identify rare and abrupt transitions in bilayer structure as a function of solute insertion depth. These transitions correspond to the slow reorganization of ionic interactions involving zwitterionic phospholipid headgroups when the solutes penetrate the lipid?water interface and when arginine is forced through the bilayer center. These rare events are shown to constitute hidden sampling barriers that limit the rate of convergence of equilibrium properties and result in systematic sampling errors. Our analysis demonstrates that the difficulty of attaining convergence for lipid bilayer-embedded solutes has, in general, been drastically underestimated. This information will assist future studies in improving accuracy by selecting a more appropriate reaction coordinate or by focusing computational resources on those regions of the reaction coordinate that exhibit slow convergence of equilibrium properties.

abstract = {Eukaryotic sodium channels are important membrane proteins involved in ion permeation, homeostasis, and electrical signaling. They are long, multidomain proteins that do not express well in heterologous systems, and hence, structure/function and biochemical studies on purified sodium channel proteins have been limited. Bacteria produce smaller, homologous tetrameric single domain channels specific for the conductance of sodium ions. They consist of N-terminal voltage sensor and C-terminal pore subdomains. We designed a functional pore-only channel consisting of the final two transmembrane helices, the intervening P-region, and the C-terminal extramembranous region of the sodium channel from the marine bacterium Silicibacter pomeroyi. This sodium "pore" channel forms a tetrameric, folded structure that is capable of supporting sodium flux in phospholipid vesicles. The pore-only channel is more thermally stable than its full-length counterpart, suggesting that the voltage sensor subdomain may destabilize the full-length channel. The pore subdomains can assemble, fold, and function independently from the voltage sensor and exhibit similar ligand-blocking characteristics as the intact channel. The availability of this simple pore-only construct should enable high-level expression for the testing of potential new ligands and enhance our understanding of the structural features that govern sodium selectivity and permeability.},

abstract = {Studies of the dimerization of transmembrane (TM) helices have been ongoing for many years now, and have provided clues to the fundamental principles behind membrane protein (MP) folding. Our understanding of TM helix dimerization has been dominated by the idea that sequence motifs, simple recognizable amino acid sequences that drive lateral interaction, can be used to explain and predict the lateral interactions between TM helices in membrane proteins. But as more and more unique interacting helices are characterized, it is becoming clear that the sequence motif paradigm is incomplete. Experimental evidence suggests that the search for sequence motifs, as mediators of TM helix dimerization, cannot solve the membrane protein folding problem alone. Here we review the current understanding in the field, as it has evolved from the paradigm of sequence motifs into a view in which the interactions between TM helices are much more complex.

abstract = {The aggregation of soluble proteins into fibrillar species is a complex process that spans many lengths and time scales, and that involves the formation of numerous on-pathway and off-pathway intermediate species. Despite this complexity, several elements underlying the aggregation process appear to be universal. The kinetics typically follows a nucleation-growth process, and proteins with very different sequences aggregate to form similar fibril structures, populating intermediates with sufficient structural similarity to bind to a common antibody. This review focuses on a computational approach that exploits the common features of aggregation to simplify or 'coarse-grain' the representation of the protein. We highlight recent developments in coarse-grained modeling and illustrate how these models have been able to shed new light into the mechanisms of protein aggregation and the nature of aggregation intermediates. The roles of aggregation prone conformations in the monomeric state and the influence of inherent $\beta$-sheet and aggregation propensities in modulating aggregation pathways are discussed.},

abstract = {In the prokaryotic potassium channel KcsA activation gating at the inner bundle gate is followed by C-type inactivation at the selectivity filter. Entry into the C-type inactivated state has been directly linked to the strength of the H-bond interaction between residues Glu-71 and Asp-80 behind the filter, and is allosterically triggered by the rearrangement of the inner bundle gate. Here, we show that H-bond pairing between residues Trp-67 and Asp-80, conserved in most K(+) channels, constitutes another critical interaction that determines the rate and extent of KcsA C-type inactivation. Disruption of the equivalent interaction in Shaker (Trp-434-Asp-447) and Kv1.2 (Trp-366-Asp-379) leads also to modulation of the inactivation process, suggesting that these residues also play an analogous role in the inactivation gating of Kv channels. The present results show that in KcsA C-type inactivation gating is governed by a multipoint hydrogen-bond network formed by the triad Trp-67-Glu71-Asp-80. This triad exerts a critical role in the dynamics and conformational stability of the selectivity filter and might serve as a general modulator of selectivity filter gating in other members of the K(+) channel family.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations hold the promise of providing an atomic-level description of protein folding that cannot easily be obtained from experiments. Here, we examine the extent to which the molecular mechanics force field used in such simulations might influence the observed folding pathways. To that end, we performed equilibrium simulations of a fast-folding variant of the villin headpiece using four different force fields. In each simulation, we observed a large number of transitions between the unfolded and folded states, and in all four cases, both the rate of folding and the structure of the native state were in good agreement with experiments. We found, however, that the folding mechanism and the properties of the unfolded state depend substantially on the choice of force field. We thus conclude that although it is important to match a single, experimentally determined structure and folding rate, this does not ensure that a given simulation will provide a unique and correct description of the full free-energy surface and the mechanism of folding.},

abstract = {Modern protein crystal structures are based nearly exclusively on X-ray data collected at cryogenic temperatures (generally 100 K). The cooling process is thought to introduce little bias in the functional interpretation of structural results, because cryogenic temperatures minimally perturb the overall protein backbone fold. In contrast, here we show that flash cooling biases previously hidden structural ensembles in protein crystals. By analyzing available data for 30 different proteins using new computational tools for electron-density sampling, model refinement, and molecular packing analysis, we found that crystal cryocooling remodels the conformational distributions of more than 35% of side chains and eliminates packing defects necessary for functional motions. In the signaling switch protein, H-Ras, an allosteric network consistent with fluctuations detected in solution by NMR was uncovered in the room-temperature, but not the cryogenic, electron-density maps. These results expose a bias in structural databases toward smaller, overpacked, and unrealistically unique models. Monitoring room-temperature conformational ensembles by X-ray crystallography can reveal motions crucial for catalysis, ligand binding, and allosteric regulation.},

For many complex systems, however, although one observes evolution at a macroscopic scale of interest, accurate models are only given at a more detailed (fine-scale, microscopic) level of description (e.g., lattice Boltzmann, kinetic Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics). Here, we review a framework for computer-aided multiscale analysis, which enables macroscopic computational tasks (over extended spatiotemporal scales) using only appropriately initialized microscopic simulation on short time and length scales. The methodology bypasses the derivation of macroscopic evolution equations when these equations conceptually exist but are not available in closed form-hence the term equation-free. We selectively discuss basic algorithms and underlying principles and illustrate the approach through representative applications. We also discuss potential difficulties and outline areas for future research.},

abstract = {Among ion channels, only the nicotinic-receptor superfamily has evolved to generate both cation- and anion-selective members. Although other, structurally unrelated, neurotransmitter-gated cation channels exist, no other type of neurotransmitter-gated anion channel, and thus no other source of fast synaptic inhibitory signals, has been described so far. In addition to the seemingly straightforward electrostatic effect of the presence (in the cation-selective members) or absence (in the anion-selective ones) of a ring of pore-facing carboxylates, mutational studies have identified other features of the amino-acid sequence near the intracellular end of the pore-lining transmembrane segments (M2) that are also required to achieve the high charge selectivity shown by native channels. However, the mechanism underlying this more subtle effect has remained elusive and a subject of speculation. Here we show, using single-channel electrophysiological recordings to estimate the protonation state of native ionizable side chains, that anion-selective-type sequences favour whereas cation-selective-type sequences prevent the protonation of the conserved, buried basic residues at the intracellular entrance of the pore (the M2 0' position). We conclude that the previously unrecognized tunable charge state of the 0' ring of buried basic side chains is an essential feature of these channels' versatile charge-selectivity filter.},

abstract = {Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) regulates activities of numerous ion channels including inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels, KCNQ, TRP, and voltage-gated calcium channels. Several studies suggest that voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels might be regulated by PI(4,5)P2. Wide expression of KV channels in different cells suggests that such regulation could have broad physiological consequences. To study regulation of KV channels by PI(4,5)P2, we have coexpressed several of them in tsA-201 cells with a G protein-coupled receptor (M1R), a voltage-sensitive lipid 5-phosphatase (Dr-VSP), or an engineered fusion protein carrying both lipid 4-phosphatase and 5-phosphatase activity (pseudojanin). These tools deplete PI(4,5)P2 with application of muscarinic agonists, depolarization, or rapamycin, respectively. PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane was monitored by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from PH probes of PLC{delta}1 simultaneously with whole-cell recordings. Activation of Dr-VSP or recruitment of pseudojanin inhibited KV7.1, KV7.2/7.3, and Kir2.1 channel current by 90-95%. Activation of M1R inhibited KV7.2/7.3 current similarly. With these tools, we tested for potential PI(4,5)P2 regulation of activity of KV1.1/KV{beta}1.1, KV1.3, KV1.4, and KV1.5/KV{beta}1.3, KV2.1, KV3.4, KV4.2, KV4.3 (with different KChIPs and DPP6-s), and hERG/KCNE2. Interestingly, we found a substantial removal of inactivation for KV1.1/KV{beta}1.1 and KV3.4, resulting in up-regulation of current density upon activation of M1R but no changes in activity upon activating only VSP or pseudojanin. The other channels tested except possibly hERG showed no alteration in activity in any of the assays we used. In conclusion, a depletion of PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane by enzymes does not seem to influence activity of most tested KV channels, whereas it does strongly inhibit members of the KV7 and Kir families.},

abstract = {We report on a python interface to the GROMACS molecular simulation package, GromPy (available at https://github.com/GromPy). This application programming interface (API) uses the ctypes python module that allows function calls to shared libraries, for example, written in C. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported interface to the GROMACS library that uses direct library calls. GromPy can be used for extending the current GROMACS simulation and analysis modes. In this work, we demonstrate that the interface enables hybrid Monte-Carlo/molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the grand-canonical ensemble, a simulation mode that is currently not implemented in GROMACS. For this application, the interplay between GromPy and GROMACS requires only minor modifications of the GROMACS source code, not affecting the operation, efficiency, and performance of the GROMACS applications. We validate the grand-canonical application against MD in the canonical ensemble by comparison of equations of state. The results of the grand-canonical simulations are in complete agreement with MD in the canonical ensemble. The python overhead of the grand-canonical scheme is only minimal. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{Alves2011,
abstract = {Background
          Penetratin is a positively charged cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) that has the ability to bind negatively charged membrane components, such as glycosaminoglycans and anionic lipids. Whether this primary interaction of penetratin with these cell surface components implies that the peptide will be further internalized is not clear.
        
        
          Methodology
          Using mass spectrometry, the amount of internalized and membrane bound penetratin remaining after washings, were quantified in three different cell lines: wild type (WT), glycosaminoglycans- (GAGneg) and sialic acid-deficient (SAneg) cells. Additionally, the affinity and kinetics of the interaction of penetratin to membrane models composed of pure lipids and membrane fragments from the referred cell lines was investigated, as well as the thermodynamics of such interactions using plasmon resonance and calorimetry.
        
        
          Principal Findings
          Penetratin internalized with the same efficacy in the three cell lines at 1 µM, but was better internalized at 10 µM in SAneg>WT>GAGneg. The heat released by the interaction of penetratin with these cells followed the ranking order of internalization efficiency. Penetratin had an affinity of 10 nM for WT cells and µM for SAneg and GAGneg cells and model membrane of phospholipids. The remaining membrane-bound penetratin after cells washings was similar in WT and GAGneg cells, which suggested that these binding sites relied on membrane phospholipids. The interaction of penetratin with carbohydrates was more superficial and reversible while it was stronger with phospholipids, likely because the peptide can intercalate between the fatty acid chains.
        
        
          Conclusion/Significance
          These results show that accumulation and high-affinity binding of penetratin at the cell-surface do not reflect the internalization efficacy of the peptide. Altogether, these data further support translocation (membrane phospholipids interaction) as being the internalization pathway used by penetratin at low micromolecular concentration, while endocytosis is activated at higher concentration and requires accumulation of the peptide on GAG and GAG clustering.},

We therefore synthesized several (15)N isotope-enriched gA samples, covering all backbone residues as well as the Trp indole side chains for NMR relaxation experiments. On the basis of the (15)N NMR spectra for labeled gA samples incorporated in sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) micelles, we determined T(1), T(2), and heteronuclear NOE values for backbone and indole (15)NH groups. The results indicate that the SDS-incorporated gA channel is a constrained structure without an especially "floppy" region. The NMR observables, particularly those for backbone groups, are predicted well by the molecular dynamics simulations in the accompanying article (DOI 10.1021/jp200904d ).},

abstract = {Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) are potent cytolytic agents secreted by pathogenic bacteria that protect microbes against the cell-mediated immune system (by targeting phagocytic cells), disrupt epithelial barriers, and liberate materials necessary to sustain growth and colonization. Produced by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria alike, PFTs are released as water-soluble monomeric or dimeric species, bind specifically to target membranes, and assemble transmembrane channels leading to cell damage and/or lysis. Structural and biophysical analyses of individual steps in the assembly pathway are essential to fully understanding the dynamic process of channel formation. To work toward this goal, we solved by X-ray diffraction the 2.9-Å structure of the 450-kDa heptameric Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (VCC) toxin purified and crystallized in the presence of detergent. This structure, together with our previously determined 2.3-Å structure of the VCC water-soluble monomer, reveals in detail the architectural changes that occur within the channel region and accessory lectin domains during pore formation including substantial rearrangements of hydrogen-bonding networks in the pore-forming amphipathic loops. Interestingly, a ring of tryptophan residues forms the narrowest constriction in the transmembrane channel reminiscent of the phenylalanine clamp identified in anthrax protective antigen [Krantz BA, et al. (2005) Science 309:777-781].

@article{Baran2011,
abstract = {Background
          The last two decades have witnessed a dramatic acceleration in the production of genomic sequence information and publication of biomedical articles. Despite the fact that genome sequence data and publications are two of the most heavily relied-upon sources of information for many biologists, very little effort has been made to systematically integrate data from genomic sequences directly with the biological literature. For a limited number of model organisms dedicated teams manually curate publications about genes; however for species with no such dedicated staff many thousands of articles are never mapped to genes or genomic regions.
        
        
          Methodology/Principal Findings
          To overcome the lack of integration between genomic data and biological literature, we have developed pubmed2ensembl (http://www.pubmed2ensembl.org), an extension to the BioMart system that links over 2,000,000 articles in PubMed to nearly 150,000 genes in Ensembl from 50 species. We use several sources of curated (e.g., Entrez Gene) and automatically generated (e.g., gene names extracted through text-mining on MEDLINE records) sources of gene-publication links, allowing users to filter and combine different data sources to suit their individual needs for information extraction and biological discovery. In addition to extending the Ensembl BioMart database to include published information on genes, we also implemented a scripting language for automated BioMart construction and a novel BioMart interface that allows text-based queries to be performed against PubMed and PubMed Central documents in conjunction with constraints on genomic features. Finally, we illustrate the potential of pubmed2ensembl through typical use cases that involve integrated queries across the biomedical literature and genomic data.
        
        
          Conclusion/Significance
          By allowing biologists to find the relevant literature on specific genomic regions or sets of functionally related genes more easily, pubmed2ensembl offers a much-needed genome informatics inspired solution to accessing the ever-increasing biomedical literature.},

BAR domains are divided into three subfamilies: BAR- and F-BAR-domain proteins generate positive membrane curvature and stabilize cellular invaginations, whereas I-BAR-domain proteins induce negative curvature and stabilize protrusions. We show that a previously uncharacterized member of the I-BAR subfamily, Pinkbar, is specifically expressed in intestinal epithelial cells, where it localizes to Rab13-positive vesicles and to the plasma membrane at intercellular junctions. Notably, the BAR domain of Pinkbar does not induce membrane tubulation but promotes the formation of planar membrane sheets. Structural and mutagenesis analyses reveal that the BAR domain of Pinkbar has a relatively flat lipid-binding interface and that it assembles into sheet-like oligomers in crystals and in solution, which may explain its unique membrane-deforming activity.},

@article{Wee2011b,
abstract = {Most membrane proteins contain a transmembrane (TM) domain made up of a bundle of lipid-bilayer-spanning $\alpha$-helices. TM $\alpha$-helices are generally composed of a core of largely hydrophobic amino acids, with basic and aromatic amino acids at each end of the helix forming interactions with the lipid headgroups and water. In contrast, the S4 helix of ion channel voltage sensor (VS) domains contains four or five basic (largely arginine) side chains along its length and yet adopts a TM orientation as part of an independently stable VS domain. Multiscale molecular dynamics simulations are used to explore how a charged TM S4 $\alpha$-helix may be stabilized in a lipid bilayer, which is of relevance in the context of mechanisms of translocon-mediated insertion of S4. Free-energy profiles for insertion of the S4 helix into a phospholipid bilayer suggest that it is thermodynamically favorable for S4 to insert from water to the center of the membrane, where the helix adopts a TM orientation. This is consistent with crystal structures of Kv channels, biophysical studies of isolated VS domains in lipid bilayers, and studies of translocon-mediated S4 helix insertion. Decomposition of the free-energy profiles reveals the underlying physical basis for TM stability, whereby the preference of the hydrophobic residues of S4 to enter the bilayer dominates over the free-energy penalty for inserting charged residues, accompanied by local distortion of the bilayer and penetration of waters. We show that the unique combination of charged and hydrophobic residues in S4 allows it to insert stably into the membrane.},

abstract = {Integrins are large cell-surface adhesion receptors that can be activated to a high affinity state by the formation of an intracellular complex between the integrin {beta}-subunit tail, the membrane, and talin. The F2 and F3 subdomains of the talin head play a key role in formation of this complex. Here, activation of the integrin IIb/{beta}3 dimer by the talin head domain was probed using multiscale molecular dynamics simulations. A number of novel insights emerge from these studies, including (i) the importance of the integrin IIb subunit F992 and F993 residues in stabilizing the "off" state of the IIb/{beta}3 dimer, (ii) a crucial role for negatively charged groups in the F2-F3/membrane interaction, (iii) binding of the talin F2-F3 domain to negatively charged lipid headgroups in the membrane induces a reorientation of the {beta} transmembrane (TM) domain, (iv) an increase in the tilt angle of the {beta} TM domain relative to the bilayer normal helps to destabilize the /{beta} TM interaction and promote a scissor-like movement of the integrin TM helices. These results, combined with various published experimental observations, suggest a model for the mechanism of inside-out activation of integrins by talin.},

abstract = {The human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key representative of tyrosine kinase receptors, ubiquitous actors in cell signaling, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Although the receptor is well-studied, a central issue remains: How does the compositional diversity and functional diversity of the surrounding membrane modulate receptor function? Reconstituting human EGFR into proteoliposomes of well-defined and controlled lipid compositions represents a minimal synthetic approach to systematically address this question. We show that lipid composition has little effect on ligand-binding properties of the EGFR but rather exerts a profound regulatory effect on kinase domain activation. Here, the ganglioside GM3 but not other related lipids strongly inhibited the autophosphorylation of the EGFR kinase domain. This inhibitory action of GM3 was only seen in liposomes compositionally poised to phase separate into coexisting liquid domains. The inhibition by GM3 was released by either removing the neuraminic acid of the GM3 headgroup or by mutating a membrane proximal lysine of EGFR (K642G). Our results demonstrate that GM3 exhibits the potential to regulate the allosteric structural transition from inactive to a signaling EGFR dimer, by preventing the autophosphorylation of the intracellular kinase domain in response to ligand binding.},

abstract = {Anomalous diffusion has been observed abundantly in the plasma membrane of biological cells, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In general, it has not been possible to directly image the obstacles to diffusion in membranes, which are thought to be skeleton bound proteins, protein aggregates, and lipid domains, so the dynamics of diffusing particles is used to deduce the obstacle characteristics. We present a supported lipid bilayer system in which we characterized the anomalous diffusion of lipid molecules using single molecule tracking, while at the same time imaging the obstacles to diffusion with atomic force microscopy. To explain our experimental results, we performed lattice Monte Carlo simulations of tracer diffusion in the presence of the experimentally determined obstacle configurations. We correlate the observed anomalous diffusion with obstacle area fraction, fractal dimension, and correlation length. To accurately measure an anomalous diffusion exponent, we derived an expression to account for the time-averaging inherent to all single molecule tracking experiments. We show that the length of the single molecule trajectories is critical to the determination of the anomalous diffusion exponent. We further discuss our results in the context of confinement models and the generating stochastic process.},

abstract = {The Poisson–Nernst–Planck (PNP) model is based on a mean-field approximation of ion interactions and continuum descriptions of concentration and electrostatic potential. It provides qualitative explanation and increasingly quantitative predictions of experimental measurements for the ion transport problems in many areas such as semiconductor devices, nanofluidic systems, and biological systems, despite many limitations. While the PNP model gives a good prediction of the ion transport phenomenon for chemical, physical, and biological systems, the number of equations to be solved and the number of diffusion coefficient profiles to be determined for the calculation directly depend on the number of ion species in the system, since each ion species corresponds to one Nernst–Planck equation and one position-dependent diffusion coefficient profile. In a complex system with multiple ion species, the PNP can be computationally expensive and parameter demanding, as experimental measurements of diffusion coefficient profiles are generally quite limited for most confined regions such as ion channels, nanostructures and nanopores. We propose an alternative model to reduce number of Nernst–Planck equations to be solved in complex chemical and biological systems with multiple ion species by substituting Nernst–Planck equations with Boltzmann distributions of ion concentrations. As such, we solve the coupled Poisson–Boltzmann and Nernst–Planck (PBNP) equations, instead of the PNP equations. The proposed PBNP equations are derived from a total energy functional by using the variational principle. We design a number of computational techniques, including the Dirichlet to Neumann mapping, the matched interface and boundary, and relaxation based iterative procedure, to ensure efficient solution of the proposed PBNP equations. Two protein molecules, cytochrome c551 and Gramicidin A, are employed to validate the proposed model under a wide range of bulk ion concentrations and external voltages. Extensive numerical experiments show that there is an excellent consistency between the results predicted from the present PBNP model and those obtained from the PNP model in terms of the electrostatic potentials, ion concentration profiles, and current–voltage (I–V) curves. The present PBNP model is further validated by a comparison with experimental measurements of I–V curves under various ion bulk concentrations. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed PBNP model is more efficient than the original PNP model in terms of simulation time.},

abstract = {GxxxG motifs are common in transmembrane domains of membrane proteins and are often introduced to artificial peptides to inhibit or promote association to stable structures. The transmembrane domain of ErbB2 presents two separate such motifs that are proposed to be connected to stability and activity of the dimer. Using molecular simulations, we show that these sequences play a critical role during the recognition stage, forming transient complexes that lead to stable dimers. In pure phospholipid bilayers association occurs by contacts formed at the C-terminus promoted by the presence of phenylalanine residues. Helices subsequently rotate to eventually pack at short separations favored by lipid entropic contributions. In contrast, at intermediate cholesterol concentrations, a different pathway is followed that involves dimers with a weaker interface toward the N-terminus. However, at high cholesterol content, a switch toward the C-terminus is observed with an overall nonmonotonic change of the dimerization affinity. This conformational switch modulated by cholesterol has important implications on the thermodynamic, structural, and kinetic characteristics of helix-helix association in lipid membranes.},

@article{Stein2012,
abstract = {Background
          Rab GTPases constitute the largest subfamily of the Ras protein superfamily. Rab proteins regulate organelle biogenesis and transport, and display distinct binding preferences for effector and activator proteins, many of which have not been elucidated yet. The underlying molecular recognition motifs, binding partner preferences and selectivities are not well understood.
        
        
          Methodology/Principal Findings
          Comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences and the three-dimensional electrostatic and hydrophobic molecular interaction fields of 62 human Rab proteins revealed a wide range of binding properties with large differences between some Rab proteins. This analysis assists the functional annotation of Rab proteins 12, 14, 26, 37 and 41 and provided an explanation for the shared function of Rab3 and 27. Rab7a and 7b have very different electrostatic potentials, indicating that they may bind to different effector proteins and thus, exert different functions. The subfamily V Rab GTPases which are associated with endosome differ subtly in the interaction properties of their switch regions, and this may explain exchange factor specificity and exchange kinetics.
        
        
          Conclusions/Significance
          We have analysed conservation of sequence and of molecular interaction fields to cluster and annotate the human Rab proteins. The analysis of three dimensional molecular interaction fields provides detailed insight that is not available from a sequence-based approach alone. Based on our results, we predict novel functions for some Rab proteins and provide insights into their divergent functions and the determinants of their binding partner selectivity.},

A conserved sequence motif was identified that contains several cationic residues in conserved positions in an otherwise hydrophobic sequence. This 9-residue motif rapidly translocates across synthetic multibilayer vesicles and into cells while carrying a large polar dye as a "cargo" moiety. The extraordinary ability of this family of peptides to spontaneously translocate across bilayers without an energy source of any kind is distinctly different from the behavior of the well-known, highly cationic cell-penetrating peptides, such as the HIV tat peptide, which do not translocate across synthetic bilayers, and enter cells mostly by active endocytosis. Peptides that translocate spontaneously across membranes have the potential to transform the field of drug design by enabling the delivery of otherwise membrane-impermeant polar drugs into cells and tissues.

Heterodimers do not form, suggesting a fundamental role for the specific ectodomain protein interaction. Under higher physiological expression conditions , homodimers coalesce to form hetero– and homo–GPI-AP oligomer rafts through raft-based lipid interactions. When CD59 was ligated, it formed stable oligomer rafts containing up to four CD59 molecules, which triggered intracellular Ca2+ responses that were dependent on GPI anchorage and cholesterol, suggesting a key part played by transient homodimer rafts. Transient homodimer rafts are most likely one of the basic units for the organization and function of raft domains containing GPI-APs.},

Here, we present the crystal structure of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 fused to T4-lysozyme (S1P1-T4L) in complex with an antagonist sphingolipid mimic. Extracellular access to the binding pocket is occluded by the amino terminus and extracellular loops of the receptor. Access is gained by ligands entering laterally between helices I and VII within the transmembrane region of the receptor. This structure, along with mutagenesis, agonist structure-activity relationship data, and modeling, provides a detailed view of the molecular recognition and requirement for hydrophobic volume that activates S1P1, resulting in the modulation of immune and stromal cell responses.},

abstract = {The mechanism of intra-protein communication and allosteric coupling is key to understanding the structure-property relationship of protein function. For subtilisin Carlsberg, the Ca(2+)-binding loop is distal to substrate-binding and active sites, yet the serine protease function depends on Ca(2+) binding. The atomic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of apo and Ca(2+)-bound subtilisin show similar structures and there is no direct evidence that subtilisin has alternative conformations. To model the intra-protein communication due to Ca(2+) binding, we transform the sequential segments of an atomic MD trajectory into separate elastic network models to represent anharmonicity and nonlinearity effectively as the temporal and spatial variation of the mechanical coupling network. In analogy to the spectrogram of sound waves, this transformation is termed the "fluctuogram" of protein dynamics. We illustrate that the Ca(2+)-bound and apo states of subtilisin have different fluctuograms and that intra-protein communication proceeds intermittently both in space and in time. We found that residues with large mechanical coupling variation due to Ca(2+) binding correlate with the reported mutation sites selected by directed evolution for improving the stability of subtilisin and its activity in a non-aqueous environment. Furthermore, we utilize the fluctuograms calculated from MD to capture the highly correlated residues in a multiple sequence alignment. We show that in addition to the magnitude, the variance of coupling strength is also an indicative property for the sequence correlation observed in a statistical coupling analysis. The results of this work illustrate that the mechanical coupling networks calculated from atomic details can be used to correlate with functionally important mutation sites and co-evolution.},

Over the past 10 years or so, molecular dynamics simulations have become an established part of the biophysicist’s tool kit for the study of model biological membranes. As simulation time scales move from tens to hundreds of nanoseconds and beyond, it is timely to re-evaluate the accuracy of simulation models. We describe a comparative analysis of five freely available force fields that are commonly used to model lipid bilayers. We focus our analysis on 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayers.

abstract = {Although reconstitution of membrane proteins within protein detergent complexes is often used to enable their structural or biophysical characterization, it is unclear how one should rationally choose the appropriate micellar environment to preserve native protein folding. Here, we investigated model mixed micelles consisting of a nonionic glucosylated alkane surfactant from the maltoside and thiomaltoside families, bile salt surfactant, and the steryl derivative cholesteryl hemisuccinate. We correlated several key attributes of these micelles with the in vitro ligand-binding activity of hA(2)aR in these systems. Through small-angle neutron scattering and radioligand-binding analysis, we found several key aspects of mixed micellar systems that preserve the activity of hA(2)aR, including a critical amount of cholesteryl hemisuccinate per micelle, and an optimal hydrophobic thickness of the micelle that is analogous to the thickness of native mammalian bilayers. These features are closely linked to the headgroup chemistry of the surfactant and the hydrocarbon chain length, which influence both the morphology and composition of resulting micelles. This study should serve as a general guide for selecting the appropriate mixed surfactant systems to stabilize membrane proteins for biophysical analysis.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis has a key role in the regulation of aerobic metabolism and cell survival, but the molecular identity of the Ca(2+) channel, the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, is still unknown. Here we have identified in silico a protein (named MCU) that shares tissue distribution with MICU1 (also known as CBARA1), a recently characterized uniporter regulator, is present in organisms in which mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake was demonstrated and whose sequence includes two transmembrane domains. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of MCU in HeLa cells markedly reduced mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake. MCU overexpression doubled the matrix Ca(2+) concentration increase evoked by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-generating agonists, thus significantly buffering the cytosolic elevation. The purified MCU protein showed channel activity in planar lipid bilayers, with electrophysiological properties and inhibitor sensitivity of the uniporter. A mutant MCU, in which two negatively charged residues of the putative pore-forming region were replaced, had no channel activity and reduced agonist-dependent matrix Ca(2+) concentration transients when overexpressed in HeLa cells. Overall, these data demonstrate that the 40-kDa protein identified is the channel responsible for ruthenium-red-sensitive mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, thus providing a molecular basis for this process of utmost physiological and pathological relevance.},

abstract = {The core mechanism of intracellular vesicle fusion consists of SNAREpin zippering between vesicular and target membranes. Recent studies indicate that the same SNARE-binding protein, complexin (CPX), can act either as a facilitator or as an inhibitor of membrane fusion, constituting a controversial dilemma. Here we take energetic measurements with the surface force apparatus that reveal that CPX acts sequentially on assembling SNAREpins, first facilitating zippering by nearly doubling the distance at which v- and t-SNAREs can engage and then clamping them into a half-zippered fusion-incompetent state. Specifically, we find that the central helix of CPX allows SNAREs to form this intermediate energetic state at 9-15 nm but not when the bilayers are closer than 9 nm. Stabilizing the activated-clamped state at separations of less than 9 nm requires the accessory helix of CPX, which prevents membrane-proximal assembly of SNAREpins.},

abstract = {Numerous membrane importers rely on accessory water-soluble proteins to capture their substrates. These substrate-binding proteins (SBP) have a strong affinity for their ligands; yet, substrate release onto the low-affinity membrane transporter must occur for uptake to proceed. It is generally accepted that release is facilitated by the association of SBP and transporter, upon which the SBP adopts a conformation similar to the unliganded state, whose affinity is sufficiently reduced. Despite the appeal of this mechanism, however, direct supporting evidence is lacking. Here, we use experimental and theoretical methods to demonstrate that an allosteric mechanism of enhanced substrate release is indeed plausible. First, we report the atomic-resolution structure of apo TeaA, the SBP of the Na(+)-coupled ectoine TRAP transporter TeaBC from Halomonas elongata DSM2581(T), and compare it with the substrate-bound structure previously reported. Conformational free-energy landscape calculations based upon molecular dynamics simulations are then used to dissect the mechanism that couples ectoine binding to structural change in TeaA. These insights allow us to design a triple mutation that biases TeaA toward apo-like conformations without directly perturbing the binding cleft, thus mimicking the influence of the membrane transporter. Calorimetric measurements demonstrate that the ectoine affinity of the conformationally biased triple mutant is 100-fold weaker than that of the wild type. By contrast, a control mutant predicted to be conformationally unbiased displays wild-type affinity. This work thus demonstrates that substrate release from SBPs onto their membrane transporters can be facilitated by the latter through a mechanism of allosteric modulation of the former.},

Here, we report molecular-dynamics simulations of the bacterial multidrug ATP-binding cassette transporter Sav1866. In two simulations of the ATP/apo state, the empty site opened substantially by way of rotation of the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) core subdomain, whereas the ATP-bound site remained occluded and intact. We correlate our findings with elastic network and molecular-dynamics simulation analyses of the Sav1866 NBD monomer, and with existing experimental data, to argue that the observed transition is physiological, and that the final structure observed in the ATP/apo simulations corresponds to the tight/loose state of the NBD dimer characterized experimentally.},

We used molecular dynamics simulations to examine interactions with lipids of several VS homologs. VSs in intact channels in the activated state are exposed to phospholipids, leading to a characteristic local distortion of the lipid bilayer which decreases its thickness by ∼10 \AA. This effect is mediated by a conserved hydrophilic stretch in the S4-S5 segment linking the VS and the pore domains, and may favor gating charges crossing the membrane. In cationic lipid bilayers lacking phosphate groups, VSs form fewer contacts with lipid headgroups. The S3-S4 paddle motifs show persistent interactions of individual lipid molecules, influenced by the hairpin loop. In conclusion, our results suggest common interactions with phospholipids for various VS homologs, providing insights into the molecular basis of their stabilization in the membrane and how they are altered by lipid modification.},

UraA has a novel structural fold, with 14 transmembrane segments (TMs) divided into two inverted repeats. A pair of antiparallel $\beta$-strands is located between TM3 and TM10 and has an important role in structural organization and substrate recognition. The structure is spatially arranged into a core domain and a gate domain. Uracil, located at the interface between the two domains, is coordinated mainly by residues from the core domain.

abstract = {The response of a membrane-bound Kv1.2 ion channel to an applied transmembrane potential has been studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Channel deactivation is shown to involve three intermediate states of the voltage sensor domain (VSD), and concomitant movement of helix S4 charges 10-15 Å along the bilayer normal; the latter being enabled by zipper-like sequential pairing of S4 basic residues with neighboring VSD acidic residues and membrane-lipid head groups. During the observed sequential transitions S4 basic residues pass through the recently discovered charge transfer center with its conserved phenylalanine residue, F(233). Analysis indicates that the local electric field within the VSD is focused near the F(233) residue and that it remains essentially unaltered during the entire process. Overall, the present computations provide an atomistic description of VSD response to hyperpolarization, add support to the sliding helix model, and capture essential features inferred from a variety of recent experiments.},

abstract = {During their synthesis, many water-soluble proteins and nearly all membrane proteins transit through a protein-conducting channel in the membrane, the Sec translocon, from where they are inserted into the lipid bilayer. Increasing evidence indicates that folding of the nascent protein begins already within the ribosomal exit tunnel in a sequence- and environment-dependent fashion. To examine the effects of the translocon on the nascent-chain folding, we have calculated the potential of mean force for $\alpha$-helix formation of a 10-alanine oligopeptide as a function of its position within the translocon channel. We find that the predominant conformational states, $\alpha$-helical and extended, reflect those found for the peptide in water. However, the translocon, via its surface properties and its variable diameter, shifts the equilibrium in favor of the $\alpha$-helical state. Thus, we suggest that the translocon facilitates not only the insertion of membrane proteins into the bilayer but also their folding.},

@article{Gambin2010,
abstract = {A hydrophobic mismatch between protein length and membrane thickness can lead to a modification of protein conformation, function, and oligomerization. To study the role of hydrophobic mismatch, we have measured the change in mobility of transmembrane peptides possessing a hydrophobic helix of various length d(pi) in lipid membranes of giant vesicles. We also used a model system where the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayers, h, can be tuned at will. We precisely measured the diffusion coefficient of the embedded peptides and gained access to the apparent size of diffusing objects. For bilayers thinner than d(pi), the diffusion coefficient decreases, and the derived characteristic sizes are larger than the peptide radii. Previous studies suggest that peptides accommodate by tilting. This scenario was confirmed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. As the membrane thickness increases, the value of the diffusion coefficient increases to reach a maximum at h approximately = d(pi). We show that this variation in diffusion coefficient is consistent with a decrease in peptide tilt. To do so, we have derived a relation between the diffusion coefficient and the tilt angle, and we used this relation to derive the peptide tilt from our diffusion measurements. As the membrane thickness increases, the peptides raise (i.e., their tilt is reduced) and reach an upright position and a maximal mobility for h approximately = d(pi). Using accessibility measurements, we show that when the membrane becomes too thick, the peptide polar heads sink into the interfacial region. Surprisingly, this "pinching" behavior does not hinder the lateral diffusion of the transmembrane peptides. Ultimately, a break in the peptide transmembrane anchorage is observed and is revealed by a "jump" in the D values.},

The diffusion of the lipids in the complex is much slower compared to the rest of the lipids. We also find a strong directional correlation between the movements of the protein and the lipids in its vicinity. The results imply that in crowded membrane environments there are no "free" lipids, as they are all influenced by the protein structure and dynamics.

abstract = {The accurate prediction of membrane-insertion probability for arbitrary protein sequences is a critical challenge to identifying membrane proteins and determining their folded structures. Although algorithms based on sequence statistics have had moderate success, a complete understanding of the energetic factors that drive the insertion of membrane proteins is essential to thoroughly meeting this challenge. In the last few years, numerous attempts to define a free-energy scale for amino-acid insertion have been made, yet disagreement between most experimental and theoretical scales persists. However, for a recently resolved water-to-bilayer scale, it is found that molecular dynamics simulations that carefully mimic the conditions of the experiment can reproduce experimental free energies, even when using the same force field as previous computational studies that were cited as evidence of this disagreement. Therefore, it is suggested that experimental and simulation-based scales can both be accurate and that discrepancies stem from disparities in the microscopic processes being considered rather than methodological errors. Furthermore, these disparities make the development of a single universally applicable membrane-insertion free energy scale difficult.},

abstract = {F(o)F(1)-ATPase is a rotary motor protein synthesizing ATP from ADP driven by a cross-membrane proton gradient. The proton flow through the membrane-embedded F(o) generates the rotary torque that drives the rotation of the asymmetric shaft of F(1). Mechanical energy of the rotating shaft is used by the F(1) catalytic subunit to synthesize ATP. It was suggested that elastic power transmission with transient storage of energy in some compliant part of the shaft is required for the observed high turnover rate. We used atomistic simulations to study the spatial distribution and structural determinants of the F(1) torsional elasticity at the molecular level and to comprehensively characterize the elastic properties of F(1)-ATPase. Our fluctuation analysis revealed an unexpected heterogeneity of the F(1) shaft elasticity. Further, we found that the measured overall torsional moduli of the shaft arise from two distinct contributions, the intrinsic elasticity and the effective potential imposed on the shaft by the catalytic subunit. Separation of these two contributions provided a quantitative description of the coupling between the rotor and the catalytic subunit. This description enabled us to propose a minimal quantitative model of the F(1) energetics along the rotary degrees of freedom near the resting state observed in the crystal structures. As opposed to the usually employed models where the motor mechanical progression is described by a single angular variable, our multidimensional treatment incorporates the spatially inhomogeneous nature of the shaft and its interactions with the stator and offers new insight into the mechanoenzymatics of F(1)-ATPase.},

abstract = {Nascent membrane proteins typically insert in a sequential fashion into the membrane via a protein-conducting channel, the Sec translocon. How this process occurs is still unclear, although a thermodynamic partitioning between the channel and the membrane environment has been proposed. Experiment- and simulation-based scales for the insertion free energy of various amino acids are, however, at variance, the former appearing to lie in a narrower range than the latter. Membrane insertion of arginine, for instance, requires 14-17 kcal/mol according to molecular dynamics simulations, but only 2-3 kcal/mol according to experiment. We suggest that this disagreement is resolved by assuming a two-stage insertion process wherein the first step, the insertion into the translocon, is energized by protein synthesis and, therefore, has an effectively zero free-energy cost; the second step, the insertion into the membrane, invokes the translocon as an intermediary between the fully hydrated and the fully inserted locations. Using free-energy perturbation calculations, the effective transfer free energies from the translocon to the membrane have been determined for both arginine and leucine amino acids carried by a background polyleucine helix. Indeed, the insertion penalty for arginine as well as the insertion gain for leucine from the translocon to the membrane is found to be significantly reduced compared to direct insertion from water, resulting in the same compression as observed in the experiment-based scale.},

abstract = {Despite its long history of use and abuse in human culture, the molecular basis for alcohol action in the brain is poorly understood. The recent determination of the atomic-scale structure of GLIC, a prokaryotic member of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) family, provides a unique opportunity to characterize the structural basis for modulation of these channels, many of which are alcohol targets in brain. We observed that GLIC recapitulates bimodal modulation by n-alcohols, similar to some eukaryotic pLGICs: methanol and ethanol weakly potentiated proton-activated currents in GLIC, whereas n-alcohols larger than ethanol inhibited them. Mapping of residues important to alcohol modulation of ionotropic receptors for glycine, {gamma}-aminobutyric acid, and acetylcholine onto GLIC revealed their proximity to transmembrane cavities that may accommodate one or more alcohol molecules. Site-directed mutations in the pore-lining M2 helix allowed the identification of four residues that influence alcohol potentiation, with the direction of their effects reflecting -helical structure. At one of the potentiation-enhancing residues, decreased side chain volume converted GLIC into a highly ethanol-sensitive channel, comparable to its eukaryotic relatives. Covalent labeling of M2 positions with an alcohol analog, a methanethiosulfonate reagent, further implicated residues at the extracellular end of the helix in alcohol binding. Molecular dynamics simulations elucidated the structural consequences of a potentiation-enhancing mutation and suggested a structural mechanism for alcohol potentiation via interaction with a transmembrane cavity previously termed the "linking tunnel." These results provide a unique structural model for independent potentiating and inhibitory interactions of n-alcohols with a pLGIC family member.},

abstract = {Many voltage-gated ion channel (VGIC) superfamily members contain six-transmembrane segments in which the first four form a voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and the last two form the pore domain (PD). Studies of potassium channels from the VGIC superfamily together with identification of voltage-sensor only proteins have suggested that the VSD and the PD can fold independently. Whether such transmembrane modularity is common to other VGIC superfamily members has remained untested. Here we show, using protein dissection, that the Silicibacter pomeroyi voltage-gated sodium channel (NaVSp1) PD forms a stand-alone, ion selective pore (NaVSp1p) that is tetrameric, -helical, and that forms functional, sodium-selective channels when reconstituted into lipid bilayers. Mutation of the NaVSp1p selectivity filter from LESWSM to LDDWSD, a change similar to that previously shown to alter ion selectivity of the bacterial sodium channel NaVBh1 (NaChBac), creates a calcium-selective pore-only channel, CaVSp1p. We further show that production of PDs can be generalized by making pore-only proteins from two other extremophile NaVs: one from the hydrocarbon degrader Alcanivorax borkumensis (NaVAb1p), and one from the arsenite oxidizer Alkalilimnicola ehrlichei (NaVAe1p). Together, our data establish a family of active pore-only ion channels that should be excellent model systems for study of the factors that govern both sodium and calcium selectivity and permeability. Further, our findings suggest that similar dissection approaches may be applicable to a wide range of VGICs and, thus, serve as a means to simplify and accelerate biophysical, structural, and drug development efforts.},

abstract = {The reasons for distortions from optimal $\alpha$-helical geometry are widely unknown, but their influences on structural changes of proteins are significant. Hence, their prediction is a crucial problem in structural bioinformatics. For the particular case of kink prediction, we generated a data set of 132 membrane proteins containing 1014 manually labeled helices and examined the environment of kinks. Our sequence analysis confirms the great relevance of proline and reveals disproportionately high occurrences of glycine and serine at kink positions. The structural analysis shows significantly different solvent accessible surface area mean values for kinked and nonkinked helices. More important, we used this data set to validate string kernels for support vector machines as a new kink prediction method. Applying the new predictor, about 80% of all helices could be correctly predicted as kinked or nonkinked even when focusing on small helical fragments. The results exceed recently reported accuracies of alternative approaches and are a consequence of both the method and the data set.},

abstract = {Small multidrug resistance transporters provide an ideal system to study the minimal requirements for active transport. EmrE is one such transporter in Escherichia coli. It exports a broad class of polyaromatic cation substrates, thus conferring resistance to drug compounds matching this chemical description. However, a great deal of controversy has surrounded the topology of the EmrE homodimer. Here we show that asymmetric antiparallel EmrE exchanges between inward- and outward-facing states that are identical except that they have opposite orientation in the membrane. We quantitatively measure the global conformational exchange between these two states for substrate-bound EmrE in bicelles using solution NMR dynamics experiments. F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer reveals that the monomers within each dimer are antiparallel, and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR experiments demonstrate differential water accessibility of the two monomers within each dimer. Our experiments reveal a 'dynamic symmetry' that reconciles the asymmetric EmrE structure with the functional symmetry of residues in the active site.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are being applied to increasingly complex systems, including those involving small endogenous compounds and drug molecules. In order to obtain meaningful and accurate data from these simulations, high-quality topologies for small molecules must be generated in a manner that is consistent with the derivation of the force field applied to the system. Often, force fields are designed for use with macromolecules such as proteins, making their transferability to other species challenging. Investigators are increasingly attracted to automated topology generation programs, although the quality of the resulting topologies remains unknown. Here we assess the applicability of the popular PRODRG server that generates small-molecule topologies for use with the GROMOS family of force fields. We find that PRODRG does not reproduce topologies for even the most well-characterized species in the force field due to inconsistent charges and charge groups. We assessed the effects of PRODRG-derived charges on several systems: pure liquids, amino acids at a hydrophobic−hydrophilic interface, and an enzyme−cofactor complex. We found that partial atomic charges generated by PRODRG are largely incompatible with GROMOS force fields, and the behavior of these systems deviates substantially from that of simulations using GROMOS parameters. We conclude by proposing several points as “best practices” for parametrization of small molecules under the GROMOS force fields.},

Biomimetic design will facilitate production of stable synthetic nanopores with defined functionality. Bacterial porins offer a good source of possible templates for such nanopores as they form stable, selective pores in lipid bilayers. Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to design simple model nanopores with permeation free energy profiles that can be made to mimic a template protein, the OprP porin, which forms pores selective for anions. In particular we explored the effects of varying the nature of pore-lining groups on free energy profiles for phosphate and chloride ions along the pore axis and the total charge of the permeation pathway of the pore. Cationic "sidechains" lining the model nanopore are required to model the local detail the OprP permeation landscape whereas the total charge contributes to its magnitude. These studies indicate that a locally accurate biomimetic design has captured the essentials of the structure/function relationship of the parent protein.},

abstract = {Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; ErbB1, HER1 in humans) is a receptor tyrosine kinase triggering signals across the plasma membranes of cells to determine cell fate. We have used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate structural models of ErbB1 ectodomains. We show that, with minor rearrangements, the ErbB1 back-to-back dimer can align almost flat on the cell membrane. This is in contrast to the traditional picture of ErbB1 dimers standing proud of the membrane, but in line with recent FRET and EM experiments. Interaction with the membrane leads to conformational changes in the dimer, which further stabilize the back-to-back interface. On the membrane, two dimers can associate forming a tetramer. This is enabled by a head-to-head interface, involving the ligand binding side of the ectodomain, and which significantly enhances ligand binding. A weak head-to-head interface has been seen in crystal structures, but is found to stabilise appreciably in our simulation. We also find that the domains IV, connecting the receptor to the membrane, weakly interact with each other. These simulations illustrate some of the flexibility of the ErbB1 ectodomains, and may help to explain recent experimental results.},

abstract = {The aggregation of soluble proteins into fibrillar species is a complex process that spans many lengths and time scales, and that involves the formation of numerous on-pathway and off-pathway intermediate species. Despite this complexity, several elements underlying the aggregation process appear to be universal. The kinetics typically follows a nucleation-growth process, and proteins with very different sequences aggregate to form similar fibril structures, populating intermediates with sufficient structural similarity to bind to a common antibody. This review focuses on a computational approach that exploits the common features of aggregation to simplify or 'coarse-grain' the representation of the protein. We highlight recent developments in coarse-grained modeling and illustrate how these models have been able to shed new light into the mechanisms of protein aggregation and the nature of aggregation intermediates. The roles of aggregation prone conformations in the monomeric state and the influence of inherent -sheet and aggregation propensities in modulating aggregation pathways are discussed.},

@article{Tai2009,
abstract = {The energetic profile of an ion translated along the axis of an ion channel should reveal whether the structure corresponds to a functionally open or closed state of the channel. In this study, we explore the combined use of PoissonBoltzmann electrostatic calculations and evaluation of van der Waals interactions between ion and pore to provide an initial appraisal of the gating state of a channel. This approach is exemplified by its application to the bacterial inward rectifier potassium channel KirBac3.1, where it reveals the closed gate to be formed by a ring of leucine (L124) side chains. We have extended this analysis to a comparative survey of gating profiles, including model hydrophobic nanopores, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and a number of potassium channel structures and models. This enables us to identify three gating regimes, and to show the limitation of this computationally inexpensive method. For a (closed) gate radius of 0.4 nm < R < 0.8 nm, a hydrophobic gate may be present. For a gate radius of 0.2 nm < R < 0.4 nm, both electrostatic and van der Waals interactions will contribute to the barrier height. Below R = 0.2 nm, repulsive van der Waals interactions are likely to dominate, resulting in a sterically occluded gate. In general, the method is more useful when the channel is wider; for narrower channels, the flexibility of the protein may allow otherwise-unsurmountable energetic barriers to be overcome.},

Physiologically, these channels appear to control the noxious input threshold for temperature and pressure sensitivity in dorsal root ganglia neurons. We present the crystal structure of human TRAAK at a resolution of 3.8 angstroms. The channel comprises two protomers, each containing two distinct pore domains, which create a two-fold symmetric K+ channel. The extracellular surface features a helical cap, 35 angstroms tall, that creates a bifurcated pore entryway and accounts for the insensitivity of two–pore domain K+ channels to inhibitory toxins. Two diagonally opposed gate-forming inner helices form membrane-interacting structures that may underlie this channel’s sensitivity to chemical and mechanical properties of the cell membrane.},

The $\alpha$-helical peptide dramatically affects the phase behavior and structure of anionic bilayers but not those of zwitterionic bilayers. Piscidin 1 stabilizes anionic bilayers, which remain well aligned up to 61°C when piscidin 1 is on the membrane surface. Two-dimensional separated-local-field experiments show that the tilt angle of the peptide is 80 ± 5°, in agreement with previous results on mechanically aligned bilayers. The peptide undergoes fast rotational diffusion about the bilayer normal under these conditions, and these studies demonstrate that magnetically aligned bilayers are well suited for structural studies of amphipathic peptides.},

Mechanistic studies have suggested that two fundamental properties are shared by all exchangers: substrate binding is antagonistic, and coupling is maintained by preventing shuttling of the empty transporter. The CLC H(+)/Cl(-) exchangers control the homeostasis of cellular compartments in most living organisms, but their transport mechanism remains unclear. We show that substrate binding to CLC-ec1 is synergistic rather than antagonistic: chloride binding induces protonation of a crucial glutamate. The simultaneous binding of H(+) and Cl(-) gives rise to a fully loaded state that is incompatible with conventional transport mechanisms. Mutations in the Cl(-) transport pathway identically alter the stoichiometries of H(+)/Cl(-) exchange and binding. We propose that the thermodynamics of synergistic substrate binding, rather than the kinetics of conformational changes and ion binding, determine the stoichiometry of transport.},

abstract = {Association of transmembrane (TM) helices taking place in the cell membrane has an important contribution to the biological function of bitopic proteins, among which receptor tyrosine kinases represent a typical example and a potent target for medical applications. Since this process depends on a complex interplay of different factors (primary structures of TM domains and juxtamembrane regions, composition and phase of the local membrane environment, etc.), it is still far from being fully understood. Here, we present a computational modeling framework, which we have applied to systematically analyze dimerization of 18 TM helical homo- and heterodimers of different bitopic proteins, including the family of epidermal growth factor receptors (ErbBs). For this purpose, we have developed a novel surface-based modeling approach, which is able to not only predict particular conformations of TM dimers in good agreement with experiment, but also provides screening of their conformational heterogeneity. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of several of the predicted dimers in different model membranes, we have elucidated a putative role of the environment in selection of particular conformations. Simulation results clearly show that each particular bilayer preferentially stabilizes one of possible dimer conformations, and that the energy gain depends on the interplay between structural properties of the protein and the membrane. Moreover, the character of protein-driven perturbations of the bilayer is reflected in the contribution of a particular membrane to the free energy gain. We have found that the approximated dimerization strength for ErbBs family can be related to their oncogenic ability.},

abstract = {Lactose permease (LacY) is the prototype of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of secondary transporters. Available structures of LacY reveal a state in which the substrate is exposed to the cytoplasm but is occluded from the periplasm. However, the alternating-access transport mechanism requires the existence of a periplasm-facing state. We recently showed that inverted-topology structural repeats provide the foundation for the mechanisms of two transporter families with folds distinct from the MFS. Here, we generated a structural model of LacY by swapping the conformations of inverted-topology repeats identified in its two domains. The model exhibits all required properties of an outward-facing conformation (i.e., closure of the binding site to the cytoplasm and exposure to the periplasm). Furthermore, the model agrees with double electron-electron resonance distance changes, accessibility to cysteine-modifying reagents, cysteine cross-linking data, and a recent structure of a distantly related transporter. Analysis of the intradomain differences between the two states suggests a role for conserved sequence motifs in occluding the central pathway through kinking of the pore-lining helices. In addition, predicted re-pairing of critical salt-bridging residues in the binding sites agrees remarkably well with previous proposals, allowing a description of the proton/sugar transport mechanism. More fundamentally, our model demonstrates that inverted-topology repeats provide the foundation for the alternating-access mechanisms of MFS transporters.},

abstract = {Recent experiments have shown that membrane-bound Ras proteins form transient, nanoscale signaling platforms that play a crucial role in high-fidelity signal transmission. However, a detailed characterization of these dynamic proteolipid substructures by high-resolution experimental techniques remains elusive. Here we use extensive semiatomic simulations to reveal the molecular basis for the formation and domain-specific distribution of Ras nanoclusters. As model systems, we chose the triply lipidated membrane targeting motif of H-ras (tH) and a large bilayer made up of di16:0-PC (DPPC), di18:2-PC (DLiPC), and cholesterol. We found that 4-10 tH molecules assemble into clusters that undergo molecular exchange in the sub-s to s time scale, depending on the simulation temperature and hence the stability of lipid domains. Driven by the opposite preference of tH palmitoyls and farnesyl for ordered and disordered membrane domains, clustered tH molecules segregate to the boundary of lipid domains. Additionally, a systematic analysis of depalmitoylated and defarnesylated tH variants allowed us to decipher the role of individual lipid modifications in domain-specific nanocluster localization and thereby explain why homologous Ras isoforms form nonoverlapping nanoclusters. Moreover, the localization of tH nanoclusters at domain boundaries resulted in a significantly lower line tension and increased membrane curvature. Taken together, these results provide a unique mechanistic insight into how protein assembly promoted by lipid-modification modulates bilayer shape to generate functional signaling platforms.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of complexin bound to a prefusion SNAREpin mimetic shows that the accessory helix extends away from the SNAREpin in an 'open' conformation, binding another SNAREpin and inhibiting its assembly, to clamp fusion. In contrast, the accessory helix in the postfusion complex parallels the SNARE complex in a 'closed' conformation. Here we use targeted mutations, FRET spectroscopy and a functional assay that reconstitutes Ca(2+)-triggered exocytosis to show that the conformational switch from open to closed in complexin is needed for synaptotagmin-Ca(2+) to trigger fusion. Triggering fusion requires the zippering of three crucial aspartate residues in the switch region (residues 64-68) of v-SNARE. Conformational switching in complexin is integral to clamp release and is probably triggered when its accessory helix is released from its trans-binding to the neighboring SNAREpin, allowing the v-SNARE to complete zippering and open a fusion pore.},

The structure reveals that the activation gate expands about 20 A, exerting a strain on the bulge helices in the C-terminal domain and generating side windows large enough to accommodate hydrated K+ ions. Functional and spectroscopic analysis of the gating transition provides direct insight into the allosteric coupling between the activation gate and the selectivity filter. We show that the movement of the inner gate helix is transmitted to the C-terminus as a straightforward expansion, leading to an upward movement and the insertion of the top third of the bulge helix into the membrane. We suggest that by limiting the extent to which the inner gate can open, the cytoplasmic domain also modulates the level of inactivation occurring at the selectivity filter.},

abstract = {Neurotransmitter/Na(+) symporters (NSSs) terminate neuronal signalling by recapturing neurotransmitter released into the synapse in a co-transport (symport) mechanism driven by the Na(+) electrochemical gradient. NSSs for dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin are targeted by the psychostimulants cocaine and amphetamine, as well as by antidepressants. The crystal structure of LeuT, a prokaryotic NSS homologue, revealed an occluded conformation in which a leucine (Leu) and two Na(+) are bound deep within the protein. This structure has been the basis for extensive structural and computational exploration of the functional mechanisms of proteins with a LeuT-like fold. Subsequently, an 'outward-open' conformation was determined in the presence of the inhibitor tryptophan, and the Na(+)-dependent formation of a dynamic outward-facing intermediate was identified using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. In addition, single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging has been used to reveal reversible transitions to an inward-open LeuT conformation, which involve the movement of transmembrane helix TM1a away from the transmembrane helical bundle. We investigated how substrate binding is coupled to structural transitions in LeuT during Na(+)-coupled transport. Here we report a process whereby substrate binding from the extracellular side of LeuT facilitates intracellular gate opening and substrate release at the intracellular face of the protein. In the presence of alanine, a substrate that is transported ∼10-fold faster than leucine, we observed alanine-induced dynamics in the intracellular gate region of LeuT that directly correlate with transport efficiency. Collectively, our data reveal functionally relevant and previously hidden aspects of the NSS transport mechanism that emphasize the functional importance of a second substrate (S2) binding site within the extracellular vestibule. Substrate binding in this S2 site appears to act cooperatively with the primary substrate (S1) binding site to control intracellular gating more than 30 \AA away, in a manner that allows the Na(+) gradient to power the transport mechanism.},

Peripheral membrane proteins characteristically perturb the lipid bilayer in their vicinity which supports the formation of protein assemblies not only within the same but surprisingly also across opposing leaflets of a bilayer. In addition, we also observed the formation of lipid-protein domains on heteregeneous membranes. The clustering ability of proteins, as quantified via the potential of mean force, is enhanced when radius and hydrophobic penetration depth of the proteins increases. Based on our data, we propose that membrane-mediated cluster formation of peripheral proteins supports protein assembly in vivo and hence may play a pivotal role in the formation of templates for signaling cascades and in the emergence of transport intermediates in the secretory pathway.},

They function by alternating between two states, exposing the substrate-binding site to either side of the membrane. A key question that remains to be addressed is how substrates initiate the transport cycle. Using x-ray crystallography, we have captured the maltose transporter in an intermediate step between the inward- and outward-facing states. We show that interactions with substrate-loaded maltose-binding protein in the periplasm induce a partial closure of the MalK dimer in the cytoplasm. ATP binding to this conformation then promotes progression to the outward-facing state. These results, interpreted in light of biochemical and functional studies, provide a structural basis to understand allosteric communication in ABC transporters.},

abstract = {The pore domain of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels consists of transmembrane helices S5 and S6, the turret, the pore helix, the selectivity filter, and the loop preceding S6, with a tertiary reentrant structure between S5 and S6. Using biogenic intermediates, mass tagging (pegylation), and a molecular tape measure, we explored the possibility that the first stages of pore formation occur prior to oligomerization of the transmembrane core. Pegylation of introduced cysteines shows that the pore helix, but not the turret, forms a compact secondary structure in the terminal 20 Å of the ribosomal tunnel. We assessed the tertiary fold of the pore loop in monomeric constructs by determining the relative accessibilities of select cysteines using the kinetics of pegylation. Turret residues are accessible at the extracellular surface. In contrast, pore helix residues are less accessible. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a single Kv monomer in a solvated lipid membrane indicate that secondary and tertiary folds are stable over 650 ns. These results are consistent with acquisition of a tertiary reentrant pore architecture at the monomer stage of Kv biogenesis and begin to define a plausible sequence of folding events in the formation of Kv channels.},

abstract = {Nascent transmembrane (TM) polypeptide segments are recognized and inserted into the lipid bilayer by the cellular translocon machinery. The recognition rules, described by a biological hydrophobicity scale, correlate strongly with physical hydrophobicity scales that describe the free energy of insertion of TM helices from water. However, the exact relationship between the physical and biological scales is unknown, because solubility problems limit our ability to measure experimentally the direct partitioning of hydrophobic peptides across lipid membranes. Here we use microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in which monomeric poly-leucine segments of different lengths are allowed to partition spontaneously into and out of lipid bilayers. This approach directly reveals all states populated at equilibrium. For the hydrophobic peptides studied here, only surface bound and transmembrane inserted helices are found. The free energy of insertion is directly obtained from the relative occupancy of these states. A water soluble state was not observed, consistent with the general insolubility of hydrophobic peptides. The approach further allows determination of the partitioning pathways and kinetics. Surprisingly, the transfer free energy appears to be independent of temperature, which implies that surface-to-bilayer peptide insertion is a zero-entropy process. We find that the partitioning free energy of the polyleucine segments correlates strongly with values from translocon experiments, but reveals a systematic shift favouring shorter peptides, suggesting that translocon-to-bilayer partitioning is not equivalent, but related to spontaneous surface-to-bilayer partitioning.},

abstract = {Accurate simulation of complex lipid bilayers has long been a goal in condensed phase molecular dynamics (MD). Structure and function of membrane-bound proteins are highly dependent on the lipid bilayer environment and are challenging to study through experimental methods. Within Amber, there has been limited focus on lipid simulations, although some success has been seen with the use of the General Amber Force Field (GAFF). However, to date there are no dedicated Amber lipid force fields. In this paper we describe a new charge derivation strategy for lipids consistent with the Amber RESP approach and a new atom and residue naming and type convention. In the first instance, we have combined this approach with GAFF parameters. The result is LIPID11, a flexible, modular framework for the simulation of lipids that is fully compatible with the existing Amber force fields. The charge derivation procedure, capping strategy, and nomenclature for LIPID11, along with preliminary simulation results and a discussion of the planned long-term parameter development are presented here. Our findings suggest that LIPID11 is a modular framework feasible for phospholipids and a flexible starting point for the development of a comprehensive, Amber-compatible lipid force field.},

abstract = {Although water molecules are small and only consist of two different atom types, they play various roles in cellular systems. This review discusses their influence on the binding process between biomacromolecular targets and small molecule ligands and how this influence can be modeled in computational drug design approaches. Both the structure and the thermodynamics of active site waters will be discussed as these influence the binding process significantly. Structurally conserved waters cannot always be determined experimentally and if observed, it is not clear if they will be replaced upon ligand binding, even if sufficient space is available. Methods to predict the presence of water in protein-ligand complexes will be reviewed. Subsequently, we will discuss methods to include water in computational drug research. Either as an additional factor in automated docking experiments, or explicitly in detailed molecular dynamics simulations, the effect of water on the quality of the simulations is significant, but not easily predicted. The most detailed calculations involve estimates of the free energy contribution of water molecules to protein-ligand complexes. These calculations are computationally demanding, but give insight in the versatility and importance of water in ligand binding.},

abstract = {Modern protein crystal structures are based nearly exclusively on X-ray data collected at cryogenic temperatures (generally 100 K). The cooling process is thought to introduce little bias in the functional interpretation of structural results, because cryogenic temperatures minimally perturb the overall protein backbone fold. In contrast, here we show that flash cooling biases previously hidden structural ensembles in protein crystals. By analyzing available data for 30 different proteins using new computational tools for electron-density sampling, model refinement, and molecular packing analysis, we found that crystal cryocooling remodels the conformational distributions of more than 35% of side chains and eliminates packing defects necessary for functional motions. In the signaling switch protein, H-Ras, an allosteric network consistent with fluctuations detected in solution by NMR was uncovered in the room-temperature, but not the cryogenic, electron-density maps. These results expose a bias in structural databases toward smaller, overpacked, and unrealistically unique models. Monitoring room-temperature conformational ensembles by X-ray crystallography can reveal motions crucial for catalysis, ligand binding, and allosteric regulation.},

abstract = {The human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key representative of tyrosine kinase receptors, ubiquitous actors in cell signaling, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Although the receptor is well-studied, a central issue remains: How does the compositional diversity and functional diversity of the surrounding membrane modulate receptor function? Reconstituting human EGFR into proteoliposomes of well-defined and controlled lipid compositions represents a minimal synthetic approach to systematically address this question. We show that lipid composition has little effect on ligand-binding properties of the EGFR but rather exerts a profound regulatory effect on kinase domain activation. Here, the ganglioside GM3 but not other related lipids strongly inhibited the autophosphorylation of the EGFR kinase domain. This inhibitory action of GM3 was only seen in liposomes compositionally poised to phase separate into coexisting liquid domains. The inhibition by GM3 was released by either removing the neuraminic acid of the GM3 headgroup or by mutating a membrane proximal lysine of EGFR (K642G). Our results demonstrate that GM3 exhibits the potential to regulate the allosteric structural transition from inactive to a signaling EGFR dimer, by preventing the autophosphorylation of the intracellular kinase domain in response to ligand binding.},

In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

abstract = {The computational design of advanced materials based on surfactant self-assembly without ever stepping foot in the laboratory is an important goal, but there are significant barriers to this approach due to the limited spatial and temporal scales accessible by computer simulations. In this paper, we report our work to bridge the gap between laboratory and computational timescales by implementing the coarse-grained (CG) force field of Shinoda, DeVane, and Klein into the HOOMD-Blue GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics software package. For a system of 25,750 particles, this implementation provides performance on a single GPU which is superior to that of a widely-used parallel MD simulation code running on an optimally-sized CPU-based cluster. Using our GPU setup, we have collected 0.6 milliseconds of molecular dynamics trajectory data for aqueous solutions of 7 different non-ionic polyethylene glycol (PEG) surfactants, with most of the systems studied representing approximately 1,000,000 atoms. From this data, we calculated various properties as a function of the length of the hydrophobic tails and PEG head groups. Specifically, we determined critical micelle concentrations (CMC) which are in good agreement with experimental data and characterized the size and shape of micelles. However, even with the microsecond trajectories employed in this study, we observed that the micelles composed of relatively hydrophobic surfactants are continuing to grow at the end of our simulations. This suggests that the final micelle size distributions of these systems depend strongly on initial conditions and that either longer simulations or advanced sampling techniques are needed to properly sample their equilibrium distributions. Nonetheless, the combination of coarse-grained modeling and GPU acceleration marks a significant step towards the computational prediction of the thermodynamic properties of slowly-evolving surfactant systems.

abstract = {Biological membranes are complex, self-organized structures that define boundaries and compartmentalize space in living matter. Composed of a wide variety of lipid and protein molecules, these responsive surfaces mediate transmembrane signaling and material transport within the cell and with its environment. It is well known that lipid membrane properties change as a function of composition and phase state, and that protein-lipid interactions can induce changes in the membrane's properties and biochemical response. Here, molecular level changes in lipid organization induced by multivalent toxin binding were investigated using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction. Structural changes to lipid monolayers at the air-water interface and bilayers at the solid-water interface were studied before and after specific binding of cholera toxin to membrane embedded receptors. At biologically relevant surface pressures, protein binding perturbed lipid packing within monolayers and bilayers resulting in topological defects and the emergence of a new orientationally textured lipid phase. In bilayers this altered lipid order was transmitted from the receptor laden exterior membrane leaflet to the inner leaflet, representing a potential mechanism for lipid mediated outside-in signaling by multivalent protein binding. It is further hypothesized that cell-surface micro-domains exhibiting this type of lipid order may serve as nucleation sites for vesicle formation in clathrin independent endocytosis of cholera toxin.},

Although far from a general automated tool, structure prediction is notable for proteins and RNA that preceded the experiment, especially by knowledge-based approaches.

Our initial findings from multiple approaches are that $\alpha$S (1) causes a significant thinning of the bilayer and (2) stabilizes positive mean curvature, such that the maximum principle curvature matches that of synaptic vesicles, $\alpha$S-induced tubules, and the synthetic lipid vesicles to which the protein binds most tightly. This suggests that $\alpha$S binding to synaptic vesicles likely stabilizes their intrinsic curvature. We then show that $\alpha$S induces local negative Gaussian curvature, an effect that occurs in regions of $\alpha$S shown previously via NMR and corroborated by MD simulation to have significant conformational flexibility. The induction of negative Gaussian curvature, which has implications for all curvature-sensing and curvature-generating amphipathic $\alpha$-helices, supports a hypothesis that connects helix insertion to fusion and fission of vesicles, processes that have recently been linked to $\alpha$S function. Then, in an effort to explain these biophysical properties of $\alpha$S, we promote an intrinsic curvature-field model that recasts long-range protein?protein interactions in terms of the interactions between the local curvature fields generated by lipid?protein complexes.

@article{Fleming2011,
abstract = {Understanding the forces that stabilize membrane proteins in their native states is one of the contemporary challenges of biophysics. To date, estimates of side chain partitioning free energies from water to the lipid environment show disparate values between experimental and computational measures. Resolving the disparities is particularly important for understanding the energetic contributions of polar and charged side chains to membrane protein function because of the roles these residue types play in many cellular functions. In general, computational free energy estimates of charged side chain partitioning into bilayers are much larger than experimental measurements. However, the lack of a protein-based experimental system that uses bilayers against which to vet these computational predictions has traditionally been a significant drawback. Moon & Fleming recently published a novel hydrophobicity scale that was derived experimentally by using a host-guest strategy to measure the side chain energetic perturbation due to mutation in the context of a native membrane protein inserted into a phospholipid bilayer. These values are still approximately an order of magnitude smaller than computational estimates derived from molecular dynamics calculations from several independent groups. Here we address this discrepancy by showing that the free energy differences between experiment and computation become much smaller if the appropriate comparisons are drawn, which suggests that the two fields may in fact be converging. In addition, we present an initial computational characterization of the Moon & Fleming experimental system used for the hydrophobicity scale: OmpLA in DLPC bilayers. The hydrophobicity scale used OmpLA position 210 as the guest site, and our preliminary results demonstrate that this position is buried in the center of the DLPC membrane, validating its usage in the experimental studies. We further showed that the introduction of charged Arg at position 210 is well tolerated in OmpLA and that the DLPC bilayers accommodate this perturbation by creating a water dimple that allows the Arg side chain to remain hydrated. Lipid head groups visit the dimple and can hydrogen bond with Arg, but these interactions are transient. Overall, our study demonstrates the unique advantages of this molecular system because it can be interrogated by both computational and experimental practitioners, and it sets the stage for free energy calculations in a system for which there is unambiguous experimental data.

We also explore the mechanism of small-molecule agonists that do not mimic the natural ligand. We show, by a combination of cysteine cross-linking, alanine-scanning mutagenesis, and computational simulations, that the TpoR TM dimerizes strongly and can adopt 3 different stable, rotationally related conformations, which may correspond to specific states of the full-length receptor (active, inactive, and partially active). Thus, our data suggest that signaling and inactive states of the receptor are related by receptor subunit rotations, rather than a simple monomer-dimer transition. Moreover, results from experiments with and without agonists in vitro and in cells allow us to propose a novel allosteric mechanism of action for a class of small molecules, in which they activate TpoR by binding to the TM region and by exploiting the rotational states of the dimeric receptor. Overall, our results support the emerging view of the participation of mutual rotations of the TM domains in cytokine receptor activation.-Matthews, E. E., Th\'{e}venin, D., Rogers, J.

abstract = {Curved membranes are an essential feature of dynamic cellular structures, including endocytic pits, filopodia protrusions and most organelles. It has been proposed that specialized proteins induce curvature by binding to membranes through two primary mechanisms: membrane scaffolding by curved proteins or complexes; and insertion of wedge-like amphipathic helices into the membrane. Recent computational studies have raised questions about the efficiency of the helix-insertion mechanism, predicting that proteins must cover nearly 100% of the membrane surface to generate high curvature, an improbable physiological situation. Thus, at present, we lack a sufficient physical explanation of how protein attachment bends membranes efficiently. On the basis of studies of epsin1 and AP180, proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we propose a third general mechanism for bending fluid cellular membranes: protein-protein crowding. By correlating membrane tubulation with measurements of protein densities on membrane surfaces, we demonstrate that lateral pressure generated by collisions between bound proteins drives bending. Whether proteins attach by inserting a helix or by binding lipid heads with an engineered tag, protein coverage above $\sim$20% is sufficient to bend membranes. Consistent with this crowding mechanism, we find that even proteins unrelated to membrane curvature, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), can bend membranes when sufficiently concentrated. These findings demonstrate a highly efficient mechanism by which the crowded protein environment on the surface of cellular membranes can contribute to membrane shape change.},

Current experimental and computational model systems approximate the complex physiological membrane environment for fusion using one or a few protein and lipid species. Here, we report results of a computational model system for fusion in which the ratio of lipid components was systematically varied, using thousands of simulations of up to a microsecond in length to predict the effects of lipid composition on both fusion kinetics and mechanism. In our simulations, increased phosphatidylcholine content in vesicles causes increased activation energies for formation of the initial stalk-like intermediate for fusion and of hemifusion intermediates, in accordance with previous continuum-mechanics theoretical treatments. We also use our large simulation dataset to quantitatively compare the mechanism by which vesicles fuse at different lipid compositions, showing a significant difference in fusion kinetics and mechanism at different compositions simulated. As physiological membranes have different compositions in the inner and outer leaflets, we examine the effect of such asymmetry, as well as the effect of membrane curvature on fusion. These predicted effects of lipid composition on fusion mechanism both underscore the way in which experimental model system construction may affect the observed mechanism of fusion and illustrate a potential mechanism for cellular regulation of the fusion process by altering membrane composition.},

No longer do we have to make costly efforts to find the things we want. We can “Google” the old classmate, find articles online, or look up the actor who was on the tip of our tongue. The results of four studies suggest that when faced with difficult questions, people are primed to think about computers and that when people expect to have future access to information, they have lower rates of recall of the information itself and enhanced recall instead for where to access it. The Internet has become a primary form of external or transactive memory, where information is stored collectively outside ourselves.},

abstract = {Experiments and molecular simulations have shown that the hydrophobic mismatch between proteins and membranes contributes significantly to lipid-mediated protein-protein interactions. In this article, we discuss the effect of cholesterol on lipid-mediated protein-protein interactions as function of hydrophobic mismatch, protein diameter and protein cluster size, lipid tail length, and temperature. To do so, we study a mesoscopic model of a hydrated bilayer containing lipids and cholesterol in which proteins are embedded, with a hybrid dissipative particle dynamics-Monte Carlo method. We propose a mechanism by which cholesterol affects protein interactions: protein-induced, cholesterol-enriched, or cholesterol-depleted lipid shells surrounding the proteins affect the lipid-mediated protein-protein interactions. Our calculations of the potential of mean force between proteins and protein clusters show that the addition of cholesterol dramatically reduces repulsive lipid-mediated interactions between proteins (protein clusters) with positive mismatch, but does not affect attractive interactions between proteins with negative mismatch. Cholesterol has only a modest effect on the repulsive interactions between proteins with different mismatch.},

abstract = {Ion conduction in K(+)-channels is usually described in terms of concerted movements of K(+) progressing in a single file through a narrow pore. Permeation is driven by an incoming ion knocking on those ions already inside the protein. A fine-tuned balance between high-affinity binding and electrostatic repulsive forces between permeant ions is needed to achieve efficient conduction. While K(+)-channels are known to be highly selective for K(+) over Na(+), some K(+) channels conduct Na(+) in the absence of K(+). Other ions are known to permeate K(+)-channels with a more moderate preference and unusual conduction features. We describe an extensive computational study on ion conduction in K(+)-channels rendering free energy profiles for the translocation of three different alkali ions and some of their mixtures. The free energy maps for Rb(+) translocation show at atomic level why experimental Rb(+) conductance is slightly lower than that of K(+). In contrast to K(+) or Rb(+), external Na(+) block K(+) currents, and the sites where Na(+) transport is hindered are characterized. Translocation of K(+)/Na(+) mixtures is energetically unfavorable owing to the absence of equally spaced ion-binding sites for Na(+), excluding Na(+) from a channel already loaded with K(+).},

abstract = {Cholesterol plays an important role in regulating the properties of phospholipid membranes. To obtain a detailed understanding of the lipid-cholesterol interactions, we have developed a mesoscopic water-lipid-cholesterol model. In this model, we take into account the hydrophobic-hydrophilic interactions and the structure of the molecules. We compute the phase diagram of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine-cholesterol by using dissipative particle dynamics and show that our model predicts many of the different phases that have been observed experimentally. In quantitative agreement with experimental data our model also shows the condensation effect; upon the addition of cholesterol, the area per lipid decreases more than one would expect from ideal mixing. Our calculations show that this effect is maximal close to the main-phase transition temperature, the lowest temperature for which the membrane is in the liquid phase, and is directly related to the increase of this main-phase transition temperature upon addition of cholesterol. We demonstrate that no condensation is observed if we slightly change the structure of the cholesterol molecule by adding an extra hydrophilic head group or if we decrease the size of the hydrophobic part of cholesterol.},

abstract = {Side chains of Lys/Arg near transmembrane domain (TMD) membrane-water interfaces can 'snorkel', placing their positive charge near negatively charged phospholipid head groups; however, snorkelling's functional effects are obscure. Integrin $\beta$ TMDs have such conserved basic amino acids. Here we use NMR spectroscopy to show that integrin $\beta$(3)(Lys 716) helps determine $\beta$(3) TMD topography. The $\alpha$(ΙΙb)$\beta$(3) TMD structure indicates that precise $\beta$(3) TMD crossing angles enable the assembly of outer and inner membrane 'clasps' that hold the $\alpha$$\beta$ TMD together to limit transmembrane signalling. Mutation of $\beta$(3)(Lys 716) caused dissociation of $\alpha$(ΙΙb)$\beta$(3) TMDs and integrin activation. To confirm that altered topography of $\beta$(3)(Lys 716) mutants activated $\alpha$(ΙΙb)$\beta$(3), we used directed evolution of $\beta$(3)(K716A) to identify substitutions restoring default state. Introduction of Pro(711) at the midpoint of $\beta$(3) TMD (A711P) increased $\alpha$(ΙΙb)$\beta$(3) TMD association and inactivated integrin $\alpha$(ΙΙb)$\beta$(3)(A711P,K716A). $\beta$(3)(Pro 711) introduced a TMD kink of 30 ± 1° precisely at the border of the outer and inner membrane clasps, thereby decoupling the tilt between these segments. Thus, widely occurring snorkelling residues in TMDs can help maintain TMD topography and membrane-embedding, thereby regulating transmembrane signalling.},

abstract = {While the importance of viral fusion peptides (e.g., hemagglutinin (HA) and gp41) in virus-cell membrane fusion is established, it is unclear how these peptides enhance membrane fusion, especially at low peptide/lipid ratios for which the peptides are not lytic. We assayed wild-type HA fusion peptide and two mutants, G1E and G13L, for their effects on the bilayer structure of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-sn-phosphatidylcholine/1,2-dioleoyl-3-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine/Sphingomyelin/Cholesterol (35:30:15:20) membranes, their structures in the lipid bilayer, and their effects on membrane fusion. All peptides bound to highly curved vesicles, but fusion was triggered only in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol). At low (1:200) peptide/lipid ratios, wild-type peptide enhanced remarkably the extent of content mixing and leakage along with the rate constants for these processes, and significantly enhanced the bilayer interior packing and filled the membrane free volume. The mutants caused no change in contents mixing or interior packing. Circular dichroism, polarized-attenuated total-internal-reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy measurements, and membrane perturbation measurements all conform to the inverted-V model for the structure of wild-type HA peptide. Similar measurements suggest that the G13L mutant adopts a less helical conformation in which the N-terminus moves closer to the bilayer interface, thus disrupting the V-structure. The G1E peptide barely perturbs the bilayer and may locate slightly above the interface. Fusion measurements suggest that the wild-type peptide promotes conversion of the stalk to an expanded trans-membrane contact intermediate through its ability to occupy hydrophobic space in a trans-membrane contact structure. While wild-type peptide increases the rate of initial intermediate and final pore formation, our results do not speak to the mechanisms for these effects, but they do leave open the possibility that it stabilizes the transition states for these events.},

Here, we report the first implementation of this model in the program NAMD. An extended Lagrangian dynamics with a dual-Langevin thermostat scheme applied to the Drude-nucleus pairs is employed to efficiently generate classical dynamic propagation near the self-consistent field limit. Large-scale MD simulations based on the Drude polarizable force field scale very well on massively distributed supercomputing platforms, the computational demand being only about 50-100% higher than for nonpolarizable models. As an illustration, a large-scale 150 mM NaCl aqueous salt solution is simulated, and the calculated ionic conductivity is shown to be in excellent agreement with experiment.},

abstract = {Ion channels gate at membrane-embedded domains by changing their conformation along the ion-conduction pathway. Inward rectifier K(+) (Kir) channels possess a unique extra-membrane cytoplasmic domain that extends this pathway. However, the relevance and contribution of this domain to ion permeation remain unclear. By qualitative X-ray crystallographic analysis, we found that the pore in the cytoplasmic domain of Kir3.2 binds cations in a valency-dependent manner, and does not allow the displacement of Mg(2+) by monovalent cations or spermine. Electrophysiological analyses revealed that the cytoplasmic pore of Kir3.2 selectively binds positively charged molecules, and has a higher affinity for Mg(2+) when it has a low probability of being open. The selective blocking of chemical modification of the side chain of pore-facing residues by Mg(2+) indicates that the mode of binding of Mg(2+) is likely to be similar to that observed in the crystal structure. These results indicate that the Kir3.2 crystal structure has a closed conformation with a negative electrostatic field potential at the cytoplasmic pore, the potential of which may be controlled by conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain to regulate ion diffusion along the pore.},

abstract = {Nascent transmembrane (TM) polypeptide segments are recognized and inserted into the lipid bilayer by the cellular translocon machinery. The recognition rules, described by a biological hydrophobicity scale, correlate strongly with physical hydrophobicity scales that describe the free energy of insertion of TM helices from water. However, the exact relationship between the physical and biological scales is unknown, because solubility problems limit our ability to measure experimentally the direct partitioning of hydrophobic peptides across lipid membranes. Here we use microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in which monomeric poly-leucine segments of different lengths are allowed to partition spontaneously into and out of lipid bilayers. This approach directly reveals all states populated at equilibrium. For the hydrophobic peptides studied here, only surface bound and transmembrane inserted helices are found. The free energy of insertion is directly obtained from the relative occupancy of these states. A water soluble state was not observed, consistent with the general insolubility of hydrophobic peptides. The approach further allows determination of the partitioning pathways and kinetics. Surprisingly, the transfer free energy appears to be independent of temperature, which implies that surface-to-bilayer peptide insertion is a zero-entropy process. We find that the partitioning free energy of the polyleucine segments correlates strongly with values from translocon experiments, but reveals a systematic shift favouring shorter peptides, suggesting that translocon-to-bilayer partitioning is not equivalent, but related to spontaneous surface-to-bilayer partitioning.},

abstract = {The X-ray structure of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel from Erwinia chrysanthemi (ELIC) has recently provided structural insight into this family of ion channels at high resolution. The structure shows a homo-pentameric protein with a barrel-stave architecture that defines an ion-conduction pore located on the fivefold axis of symmetry. In this structure, the wide aqueous vestibule that is encircled by the extracellular ligand-binding domains of the five subunits narrows to a discontinuous pore that spans the lipid bilayer. The pore is constricted by bulky hydrophobic residues towards the extracellular side, which probably serve as barriers that prevent the diffusion of ions. This interrupted pore architecture in ELIC thus depicts a non-conducting conformation of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel, the thermodynamically stable state in the absence of bound ligand. As ligand binding promotes pore opening in these ion channels and the specific ligand for ELIC has not yet been identified, we have turned our attention towards a homologous protein from the cyanobacterium Gloebacter violaceus (GLIC). GLIC was shown to form proton-gated channels that are activated by a pH decrease on the extracellular side and that do not desensitize after activation. Both prokaryotic proteins, ELIC and GLIC form ion channels that are selective for cations over anions with poor discrimination among monovalent cations, characteristics that resemble the conduction properties of the cation-selective branch of the family that includes acetylcholine and serotonin receptors. Here we present the X-ray structure of GLIC at 3.1 A resolution. The structure reveals a conformation of the channel that is distinct from ELIC and that probably resembles the open state. In combination, both structures suggest a novel gating mechanism for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels where channel opening proceeds by a change in the tilt of the pore-forming helices.},

abstract = {Muscle acetylcholine receptor ion channels mediate neurotransmission by depolarizing the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction. Inherited disorders of neuromuscular transmission, termed congenital myasthenic syndromes, are commonly caused by mutations in genes encoding the five subunits of the acetylcholine receptor that severely reduce endplate acetylcholine receptor numbers and/or cause kinetic abnormalities of acetylcholine receptor function. We tracked the cause of the myasthenic disorder in a female with onset of first symptoms at birth, who displayed mildly progressive bulbar, respiratory and generalized limb weakness with ptosis and ophthalmoplegia. Direct DNA sequencing revealed heteroallelic mutations in exon 8 of the acetylcholine receptor $\epsilon$-subunit gene. Two alleles were identified: one with the missense substitution p.$\epsilon$P282R, and the second with a deletion, c.798_800delCTT, which result in the loss of a single amino acid, residue F266, within the M2 transmembrane domain. When these acetylcholine receptor mutations were expressed in HEK 293 cells, the p.$\epsilon$P282R mutation caused severely reduced expression on the cell surface, whereas p.$\epsilon$$\Delta$F266 gave robust surface expression. Single-channel analysis for p.$\epsilon$$\Delta$F266 acetylcholine receptor channels showed the longest burst duration population was not different from wild-type acetylcholine receptor (4.39 ± 0.6 ms versus 4.68 ± 0.7 ms, n = 5 each) but that the amplitude of channel openings was reduced. Channel amplitudes at different holding potentials showed that single-channel conductance was significantly reduced in p.$\epsilon$$\Delta$F266 acetylcholine receptor channels (42.7 ± 1.4 pS, n = 8, compared with 70.9 ± 1.6 pS for wild-type, n = 6). Although a phenylalanine residue at this position within M2 is conserved throughout ligand-gated excitatory cys-loop channel subunits, deletion of equivalent residues in the other subunits of muscle acetylcholine receptor did not have equivalent effects. Modelling the impact of p.$\epsilon$$\Delta$F266 revealed only a minor alteration to channel structure. In this study we uncover the novel mechanism of reduced acetylcholine receptor channel conductance as an underlying cause of congenital myasthenic syndrome, with the 'low conductance' phenotype that results from the p.$\epsilon$$\Delta$F266 deletion mutation revealed by the coinheritance of the low-expressor mutation p.$\epsilon$P282R.},

abstract = {The mechanism of ion channel voltage gating—how channels open and close in response to voltage changes—has been debated since Hodgkin and Huxley’s seminal discovery that the crux of nerve conduction is ion flow across cellular membranes. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we show how a voltage-gated potassium channel (KV) switches between activated and deactivated states. On deactivation, pore hydrophobic collapse rapidly halts ion flow. Subsequent voltage-sensing domain (VSD) relaxation, including inward, 15-angstrom S4-helix motion, completes the transition. On activation, outward S4 motion tightens the VSD–pore linker, perturbing linker–S6-helix packing. Fluctuations allow water, then potassium ions, to reenter the pore; linker-S6 repacking stabilizes the open pore. We propose a mechanistic model for the sodium/potassium/calcium voltage-gated ion channel superfamily that reconciles apparently conflicting experimental data.},

abstract = {Repositioning existing drugs for new therapeutic uses is an efficient approach to drug discovery. We have developed a computational drug repositioning pipeline to perform large-scale molecular docking of small molecule drugs against protein drug targets, in order to map the drug-target interaction space and find novel interactions. Our method emphasizes removing false positive interaction predictions using criteria from known interaction docking, consensus scoring, and specificity. In all, our database contains 252 human protein drug targets that we classify as reliable-for-docking as well as 4621 approved and experimental small molecule drugs from DrugBank. These were cross-docked, then filtered through stringent scoring criteria to select top drug-target interactions. In particular, we used MAPK14 and the kinase inhibitor BIM-8 as examples where our stringent thresholds enriched the predicted drug-target interactions with known interactions up to 20 times compared to standard score thresholds. We validated nilotinib as a potent MAPK14 inhibitor in vitro (IC50 40 nM), suggesting a potential use for this drug in treating inflammatory diseases. The published literature indicated experimental evidence for 31 of the top predicted interactions, highlighting the promising nature of our approach. Novel interactions discovered may lead to the drug being repositioned as a therapeutic treatment for its off-target's associated disease, added insight into the drug's mechanism of action, and added insight into the drug's side effects.},

They function by alternating between two states, exposing the substrate-binding site to either side of the membrane. A key question that remains to be addressed is how substrates initiate the transport cycle. Using x-ray crystallography, we have captured the maltose transporter in an intermediate step between the inward- and outward-facing states. We show that interactions with substrate-loaded maltose-binding protein in the periplasm induce a partial closure of the MalK dimer in the cytoplasm. ATP binding to this conformation then promotes progression to the outward-facing state. These results, interpreted in light of biochemical and functional studies, provide a structural basis to understand allosteric communication in ABC transporters.},

We used high-speed atomic force microscopy to show that the rotorless F1 still “rotates”; in the isolated $\alpha$3$\beta$3 stator ring, the three $\beta$ subunits cyclically propagate conformational states in the counterclockwise direction, similar to the rotary shaft rotation in F1. The structural basis of unidirectionality is programmed in the stator ring. These findings have implications for cooperative interplay between subunits in other hexameric ATPases.},

abstract = {Membrane fusion is required for diverse biological functions ranging from viral infection to neurotransmitter release. Fusogenic proteins increase the intrinsically slow rate of fusion by coupling energetically downhill conformational changes of the protein to kinetically unfavorable fusion of the membrane-phospholipid bilayers. Class I viral fusogenic proteins have an N-terminal hydrophobic fusion peptide (FP) domain, important for interaction with the target membrane, plus a C-terminal transmembrane (C-term-TM) helical membrane anchor. The role of the water-soluble regions of fusogenic proteins has been extensively studied, but the contributions of the membrane-interacting FP and C-term-TM peptides are less well characterized. Typically, FPs are thought to bind to membranes at an angle that allows helix penetration but not traversal of the lipid bilayer. Here, we show that the FP from the paramyxovirus parainfluenza virus 5 fusogenic protein, F, forms an N-terminal TM helix, which self-associates into a hexameric bundle. This FP also interacts strongly with the C-term-TM helix. Thus, the fusogenic F protein resembles SNARE proteins involved in vesicle fusion by having water-soluble coiled coils that zipper during fusion and TM helices in both membranes. By analogy to mechanosensitive channels, the force associated with zippering of the water-soluble coiled-coil domain is expected to lead to tilting of the FP helices, promoting interaction with the C-term-TM helices. The energetically unfavorable dehydration of lipid headgroups of opposing bilayers is compensated by thermodynamically favorable interactions between the FP and C-term-TM helices as the coiled coils zipper into the membrane phase, leading to a pore lined by both lipid and protein.},

abstract = {Proteins have often evolved sequences so as to acquire the ability for regulation via allosteric conformational change. Here we investigate how allosteric dynamics is designed through sequences with nonlinear interaction features. First, for 71 allosteric proteins of which two, open and closed, structures are available, a statistical survey of interactions using an all-atom model with effective solvation shows that those residue contact interactions specific to one of the two states are significantly weaker than are the contact interactions shared by the two states. This interaction feature indicates there is underlying sequence design to facilitate conformational change. Second, based on the energy landscape theory, we implement these interaction features into a new atomic-interaction-based coarse-grained model via a multiscale simulation protocol (AICG). The AICG model outperforms standard coarse-grained models for predictions of the native-state mean fluctuations and of the conformational change direction. Third, using the new model for adenylate kinase, we show that intrinsic fluctuations in one state contain rare and large-amplitude motions nearly reaching the other state. Such large-amplitude motions are realized partly by sequence specificity and partly by the nonlinear nature of contact interactions, leading to cracking. Both features enhance conformational transition rates.},

To examine this, we used two-color quantum-dot tracking for visualization of the homodimerization of human erbB1 and quantification of the dimer off-rate (k(off)) on living cells. Kinetic parameters were extracted using a three-state hidden Markov model to identify transition rates between free, co-confined and dimerized states. We report that dimers composed of two ligand-bound receptors are long-lived and their k(off) is independent of kinase activity. By comparison, unliganded dimers have a more than four times faster k(off). Transient co-confinement of receptors promotes repeated encounters and enhances dimer formation. Mobility decreases more than six times when ligand-bound receptors dimerize. Blockade of erbB1 kinase activity or disruption of actin networks results in faster diffusion of receptor dimers. These results implicate both signal propagation and the cortical cytoskeleton in reduced mobility of signaling-competent erbB1 dimers.},

abstract = {Epsin possesses a conserved Epsin N-Terminal Homology (ENTH) domain that acts as a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) lipid targeting and membrane curvature generating element. Upon binding PIP(2), the N-terminal helix (H(0)) of the ENTH domain becomes structured and aids in the aggregation of ENTH domains, which results in extensive membrane remodeling. In the present paper, atomistic and coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to investigate the structure and the stability of ENTH domain aggregates on lipid bilayers. EPR experiments are also reported for systems composed of different ENTH-bound membrane morphologies, including membrane vesicles as well as pre-formed membrane tubules. The EPR data are used to help develop a molecular model of ENTH domain aggregates on preformed lipid tubules that are then studied by CG MD simulation. The combined computational and experimental approach suggests that ENTH domains exist predominantly as monomers on vesiculated structures, while ENTH domains self-associate into dimeric structures and even higher order oligomers on the membrane tubes. The results emphasize that the arrangement of ENTH domain aggregates depends strongly on whether the local membrane curvature is isotropic or anisotropic. The molecular mechanism of ENTH domain-induced membrane vesiculation and tubulation and the implications of the epsin's role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulting from the interplay between ENTH domain membrane binding and ENTH domain self-association are also discussed.},

Although the theory upon which these good practices rely has largely been known for many years, it is often overlooked or simply ignored. In other cases, the theoretical developments are too recent for their potential to be fully grasped and merged into popular platforms for the computation of free-energy differences. In this contribution, the current best practices for carrying out free-energy calculations using free energy perturbation and nonequilibrium work methods are discussed, demonstrating that at little to no additional cost, free-energy estimates could be markedly improved and bounded by meaningful error estimates. Monitoring the probability distributions that underlie the transformation between the states of interest, performing the calculation bidirectionally, stratifying the reaction pathway, and choosing the most appropriate paradigms and algorithms for transforming between states offer significant gains in both accuracy and precision.},

For each hydrolyzed ATP molecule, the pump extrudes three Na(+) and imports two K(+) by alternating between outward- and inward-facing conformations that preferentially bind K(+) or Na(+), respectively. Remarkably, the selective K(+) and Na(+) binding sites share several residues, and how the pump is able to achieve the selectivity required for the functional cycle is unclear. Here, free energy-perturbation molecular dynamics (FEP/MD) simulations based on the crystal structures of the Na/K pump in a K(+)-loaded state (E2·P(i)) reveal that protonation of the high-field acidic side chains involved in the binding sites is crucial to achieving the proper K(+) selectivity. This prediction is tested with electrophysiological experiments showing that the selectivity of the E2P state for K(+) over Na(+) is affected by extracellular pH.},

abstract = {Solid state nanochannels modified with supramolecular architectures are a new and interesting class of stimuli-responsive nanofluidic element. Their fundamental understanding requires describing the behavior of soft-materials in confined geometries and its responses to changes in solution conditions. Here, a nanochannel modified with a polyelectrolyte brush is studied with a molecular theory that incorporates the conformational behavior of the polymers, electrostatic, van der Waals, and repulsive interactions coupled with the ability of the polymer segments to regulate their charge through acid-base equilibrium. The theory predicts pH-dependent ionic conductivity in excellent agreement with experimental observations. The polymer chains undergo large conformational changes triggered by variations in the outer solution environment and the conductivity of the device is shown to be controlled by the charge state of the polymer. The degree of polymer charge is largely affected by charge regulation and nanoconfinement effects. The molecular calculations show that the apparent pK(a) inside the pore departs from that in solution when increasing the curvature of the nanochannel.},

@article{Steinbrecher2010,
abstract = {Cells contain a multitude of different chemical reaction paths running simultaneously and quite independently next to each other. This amazing feat is enabled by molecular recognition, the ability of biomolecules to form stable and specific complexes with each other and with their substrates. A better understanding of this process, i.e. of the kinetics, structures and thermodynamic properties of biomolecule binding, would be invaluable in the study of biological systems. In addition, as the mode of action of many pharmaceuticals is based upon their inhibition or activation of biomolecule targets, predictive models of small molecule receptor binding are very helpful tools in rational drug design. Since the goal here is normally to design a new compound with a high inhibition strength, one of the most important thermodynamic properties is the binding free energy DeltaG(0). The prediction of binding constants has always been one of the major goals in the field of computational chemistry, because the ability to reliably assess a hypothetical compound's binding properties without having to synthesize it first would save a tremendous amount of work. The different approaches to this question range from fast and simple empirical descriptor methods to elaborate simulation protocols aimed at putting the computation of free energies onto a solid foundation of statistical thermodynamics. While the later methods are still not suited for the screenings of thousands of compounds that are routinely performed in computational drug design studies, they are increasingly put to use for the detailed study of protein ligand interactions. This review will focus on molecular mechanics force field based free energy calculations and their application to the study of protein ligand interactions. After a brief overview of other popular methods for the calculation of free energies, we will describe recent advances in methodology and a variety of exemplary studies of molecular dynamics simulation based free energy calculations.},

How DRPs harness self-assembly and GTP-dependent conformational changes to remodel membranes is not understood. Here we present the crystal structure of an assembly-deficient mammalian endocytic DRP, dynamin 1, lacking the proline-rich domain, in its nucleotide-free state. The dynamin 1 monomer is an extended structure with the GTPase domain and bundle signalling element positioned on top of a long helical stalk with the pleckstrin homology domain flexibly attached on its opposing end. Dynamin 1 dimer and higher order dimer multimers form via interfaces located in the stalk. Analysis of these interfaces provides insight into DRP family member specificity and regulation and provides a framework for understanding the biogenesis of higher order DRP structures and the mechanism of DRP-mediated membrane scission events.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated sodium (Na(V)) channels initiate electrical signalling in excitable cells and are the molecular targets for drugs and disease mutations, but the structural basis for their voltage-dependent activation, ion selectivity and drug block is unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of a voltage-gated Na(+) channel from Arcobacter butzleri (NavAb) captured in a closed-pore conformation with four activated voltage sensors at 2.7 \AA resolution. The arginine gating charges make multiple hydrophilic interactions within the voltage sensor, including unanticipated hydrogen bonds to the protein backbone. Comparisons to previous open-pore potassium channel structures indicate that the voltage-sensor domains and the S4-S5 linkers dilate the central pore by pivoting together around a hinge at the base of the pore module. The NavAb selectivity filter is short, ∼4.6 \AA wide, and water filled, with four acidic side chains surrounding the narrowest part of the ion conduction pathway. This unique structure presents a high-field-strength anionic coordination site, which confers Na(+) selectivity through partial dehydration via direct interaction with glutamate side chains. Fenestrations in the sides of the pore module are unexpectedly penetrated by fatty acyl chains that extend into the central cavity, and these portals are large enough for the entry of small, hydrophobic pore-blocking drugs. This structure provides the template for understanding electrical signalling in excitable cells and the actions of drugs used for pain, epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia at the atomic level.},

Because protein folding pathways leading to knotted native protein structures are slower and less efficient than those leading to unknotted proteins with similar size and sequence, the strict conservation of the knotting patterns indicates an important physiological role of knots and slipknots in these proteins. Although little is known about the functional role of knots, recent studies have demonstrated a protein-stabilizing ability of knots and slipknots. Some of the conserved knotting patterns occur in proteins forming transmembrane channels where the slipknot loop seems to strap together the transmembrane helices forming the channel.},

However, little is known about the molecular basis of these lipid-protein interactions. In this study, NarGHI, an anaerobic respiratory complex of Escherichia coli, has been used to investigate the relations in between membrane-bound proteins with phospholipids. Activity of the NarGHI complex is enhanced by anionic phospholipids both in vivo and in vitro. The anionic cardiolipin tightly associates with the NarGHI complex and is the most effective phospholipid to restore functionality of a nearly inactive detergent-solubilized enzyme complex. A specific cardiolipin-binding site is identified on the basis of the available X-ray diffraction data and of site-directed mutagenesis experiment. One acyl chain of cardiolipin is in close proximity to the heme b(D) center and is responsible for structural adjustments of b(D) and of the adjacent quinol substrate binding site. Finally, cardiolipin binding tunes the interaction with the quinol substrate. Together, our results provide a molecular basis for the activation of a bacterial respiratory complex by cardiolipin.},

@article{Kyakuno2011,
abstract = {Studies on confined water are important not only from the viewpoint of scientific interest but also for the development of new nanoscale devices. In this work, we aimed to clarify the properties of confined water in the cylindrical pores of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) that had diameters in the range of 1.46 to 2.40 nm. A combination of x-ray diffraction (XRD), nuclear magnetic resonance, and electrical resistance measurements revealed that water inside SWCNTs with diameters between 1.68 and 2.40 nm undergoes a wet-dry type transition with the lowering of temperature; below the transition temperature Twd, water was ejected from the SWCNTs. Twd increased with increasing SWCNT diameter D. For the SWCNTs with D = 1.68, 2.00, 2.18, and 2.40 nm, Twd obtained by the XRD measurements were 218, 225, 236, and 237 K, respectively. We performed a systematic study on finite length SWCNT systems using classical molecular dynamics calculations to clarify the effect of open ends of the SWCNTs and water content on the water structure. It was found that ice structures that were formed at low temperatures were strongly affected by the bore diameter, a = D − $\sigma$OC, where $\sigma$OC is gap distance between the SWCNT and oxygen atom in water, and the number of water molecules in the system. In small pores (a < 1.02 nm), tubule ices or the so-called ice nanotubes (ice NTs) were formed irrespective of the water content. On the other hand, in larger pores (a > 1.10 nm) with small water content, filled water clusters were formed leaving some empty space in the SWCNT pore, which grew to fill the pore with increasing water content. For pores with sizes in between these two regimes (1.02 < a < 1.10 nm), tubule ice also appeared with small water content and grew with increasing water content. However, once the tubule ice filled the entire SWCNT pore, further increase in the water content resulted in encapsulation of the additional water molecules inside the tubule ice. Corresponding XRD measurements on SWCNTs with a mean diameter of 1.46 nm strongly suggested the presence of such a filled structure.},

Comput. Biol. 2010, 17 (3 ), 309 − 324 ). Significantly, our method, called Dynamic Tensor Analysis (DTA), can be performed as the simulation is progressing. It is therefore well-suited to analyzing long timescale simulations, which are critical for studying biologically relevant motions but may be too large for traditional analysis methods. In this paper, we demonstrate that the patterns discovered by DTA often correspond to functionally important conformational substates. In particular, we apply DTA to a 150 ns simulation of ubiquitin and discover patterns that provide unique insights into ubiquitin's ability to bind multiple substrates. Moreover, we take advantage of DTA's ability to identify patterns on different timescales and investigate how fast positional fluctuations may modulate slower, large-scale motions in functionally important regions. Our findings here suggest that DTA is well-suited to organizing, visualizing, and analyzing very large trajectories and discovering conformational substates.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To analyze contribution of short aggregation-prone regions (APRs), which may self-associate via cross-beta motif and were earlier identified in therapeutic mAbs, towards antigen recognition via structural analyses of antibody-antigen complexes. METHODS: A dataset of 29 publically available high-resolution crystal structures of Fab-antigen complexes was collected. Contribution of APRs towards the surface areas of the Fabs buried by the cognate antigens was computed. Propensities of amino acids to occur in APRs and to be involved in antigen binding were compared. Coincidence between APRs and individual CDR loops was examined. RESULTS: All Fabs in the dataset contain at least one APR in CDR loops and adjacent framework beta-strands. The average contribution of APRs towards buried surface area of Fabs is 16.0 +/- 10.7%. Aggregation and antigen recognition may be coupled via aromatic residues (Tyr, Trp), which occur with high propensities in both APRs and antigen binding sites. APRs are infrequent in the heavy chain CDR 3 (H3) loops (7%), but are frequent in H2 loops (45%). CONCLUSIONS: Co-incidence of APRs with antigen recognition sites can potentially lead to the loss of function upon aggregation. Rational structure-based design or selection strategies are suggested for biotherapeutics with improved druggability while maintaining potency.},

This potential arises from the difference in dipole moments of the two leaflets of the asymmetric PC/PE membrane. Our findings suggest that the transmembrane lipid asymmetry typical of most living cells can contribute to the membrane potential.},

The crystal structure of Salmonella typhimurium FocA at pH 4.0 shows that this switch involves a major rearrangement of the amino termini of individual protomers in the pentameric channel. The amino-terminal helices open or block transport in a concerted, cooperative action that indicates how FocA is gated in a pH-dependent way.

abstract = {GxxxG motifs are common in transmembrane domains of membrane proteins and are often introduced to artificial peptides to inhibit or promote association to stable structures. The transmembrane domain of ErbB2 presents two separate such motifs that are proposed to be connected to stability and activity of the dimer. Using molecular simulations, we show that these sequences play a critical role during the recognition stage, forming transient complexes that lead to stable dimers. In pure phospholipid bilayers association occurs by contacts formed at the C-terminus promoted by the presence of phenylalanine residues. Helices subsequently rotate to eventually pack at short separations favored by lipid entropic contributions. In contrast, at intermediate cholesterol concentrations, a different pathway is followed that involves dimers with a weaker interface toward the N-terminus. However, at high cholesterol content, a switch toward the C-terminus is observed with an overall nonmonotonic change of the dimerization affinity. This conformational switch modulated by cholesterol has important implications on the thermodynamic, structural, and kinetic characteristics of helix-helix association in lipid membranes.},

Electrostatic aspects of complex shapes and environments of biological molecules, in vitro and in vivo, are relatively well amenable to treatment by Poisson-Boltzmann models, which are attractive in that they possess a clear physical meaning, and can be readily solved by several mathematically sound methods.

abstract = {Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibodies have been known for some time to be functionally monovalent. Recently, the structural basis for this monovalency has been elucidated: the in vivo exchange of IgG half-molecules (one H-plus one L-chain) among IgG4. This process results in bispecific antibodies that in most situations will behave as functionally monovalent antibodies. The structural basis for the abnormal behaviour of IgG4 seems to be largely the result of a single amino acid change relative to human IgG1: the change of a proline in core hinge of IgG1 to serine. This results in a marked shift in the equilibrium between interchain disulphide bridges and intrachain disulphide bridges, which for IgG4 results in 25-75% absence of a covalent interaction between the H-chains. Because of strong non-covalent interactions between the CH3 domains (and possibly also between the CH1 domain and the trans-CH2 domain) IgG4 is a stable four-chain molecule and does not easily exchange half-molecules under standard physiological conditions in vitro. We postulate that the exchange is catalysed in vivo by protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) and/or FcRn (the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-related Fc receptor) during transit of IgG4 in the endosomal pathway in endothelial cells. Because IgG4 is predominantly expressed under conditions of chronic antigen exposure, the biological relevance of this exchange of half-molecules is that it generates antibodies that are unable to form large immune complexes and therefore have a low potential for inducing immune inflammation. In contrast to monovalent immunoglobulin fragments, these scrambled immunoglobulins have a normal half-life. The significance of the ensuing bispecificity needs further evaluation, because this will be relevant only in situations where high IgG4 responses are found to two unrelated antigens that happen to be present in the body at the same time and place. In this context the significance of IgG4 autoreactivity might have to be re-evaluated. The main function of IgG4, however, is presumably to interfere with immune inflammation induced by complement-fixing antibodies, or, in the case of helminth infection or allergy, by IgE antibodies.},

They were then flown by their brave designers to see if the design would work—often with disastrous results. Today, airplanes, helicopters, missiles, and rockets are designed in computers in a process that involves iterating through enormous numbers of designs before anything is made. Until very recently, novel drug-like molecules were nearly always made first like early airplanes, then tested to see if they were any good (although usually not on the brave scientists who created them!). The resulting extremely high failure rate is legendary. This article describes some of the evolution of computer-based design in the aerospace industry and compares it with the progress made to date in computer-aided drug design. Software development for pharmaceutical research has been largely entrepreneurial, with only relatively limited support from government and industry end-user organizations. The pharmaceutical industry is still about 30 years behind aerospace and other industries in fully recognizing the value of simulation and modeling and funding the development of the tools needed to catch up.},

Although recent advances in lipid analytics show that membranes in eukaryotic cells contain hundreds of different lipid species, the function of this lipid diversity remains enigmatic. The basic structure of cell membranes is the lipid bilayer, composed of two apposing leaflets, forming a two-dimensional liquid with fascinating properties designed to perform the functions cells require. To coordinate these functions, the bilayer has evolved the propensity to segregate its constituents laterally. This capability is based on dynamic liquid-liquid immiscibility and underlies the raft concept of membrane subcompartmentalization. This principle combines the potential for sphingolipid-cholesterol self-assembly with protein specificity to focus and regulate membrane bioactivity. Here we will review the emerging principles of membrane architecture with special emphasis on lipid organization and domain formation.},

A crystal structure of NhaA, solved at pH 4, comprises 12 transmembrane helices (TMs), arranged in two domains, with a large cytoplasm-facing funnel and a smaller periplasm-facing funnel. NhaA undergoes conformational changes, e.g., after pH elevation to alkaline ranges, and we used two computational approaches to explore them. On the basis of pseudo-symmetric features of the crystal structure, we predicted the structural architecture of an alternate, periplasm-facing state. In contrast to the crystal structure, the model presents a closed cytoplasmic funnel, and a periplasmic funnel of greater volume. To examine the transporter's functional direction of motion, we conducted elastic network analysis of the crystal structure and detected two main normal modes of motion. Notably, both analyses predicted similar trends of conformational changes, consisting of an overall rotational motion of the two domains around a putative symmetry axis at the funnel centers, perpendicular to the membrane plane. This motion, along with conformational changes within specific helices, resulted in closure at the cytoplasmic end and opening at the periplasmic end. Cross-linking experiments, performed between segments on opposite sides of the cytoplasmic funnel, revealed pH-dependent interactions consistent with the proposed conformational changes. We suggest that the model-structure and predicted motion represent alkaline pH-induced conformational changes, mediated by a cluster of evolutionarily-conserved, titratable residues, at the cytoplasmic ends of TMs II, V and IX.},

abstract = {The human apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (hASBT, SLC10A2) plays a critical role in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, as well as in cholesterol homeostasis. ASBT reclaims bile acids from the distal ileum via active sodium co-transport, in a multistep process, orchestrated by key residues in exofacial loop regions, as well as in membrane spanning helices. Here, we unravel the functional contribution of highly conserved transmembrane helix 1 (TM1) on the hASBT transport cycle. Consecutive cysteine substitution of individual residues along the TM1 helix (Ile(29)-Gly(50)), as well as exofacial Asn27 and Asn28, resulted in functional impairment of approximately 70% of mutants, despite appreciable cell surface expression for all but G50C. Cell surface expression of G50C and G50A was rescued upon MG132 treatment as well as cyclosporine A, but not by FK506 or bile acids, suggesting that Gly(50) is involved in hASBT folding. TM1 accessibility to membrane-impermeant MTSET remains confined to the exofacial half of the helix along a single, discrete face. Substrate protection from MTSET labeling was temperature-dependent for L34C, T36C and L38C, consistent with conformational changes playing a role in solvent accessibility for these mutants. Residue Leu(30) was shown to be critical for both bile acid and sodium affinity, while Asn(27), Leu(38), Thr(39) and Met(46) participate in sodium co-transport. Combined, our data demonstrate that TM1 plays a pivotal role in ASBT function and stability, thereby providing further insight in its dynamic transport mechanism.},

abstract = {Studies of the dimerization of transmembrane (TM) helices have been ongoing for many years now, and have provided clues to the fundamental principles behind membrane protein (MP) folding. Our understanding of TM helix dimerization has been dominated by the idea that sequence motifs, simple recognizable amino acid sequences that drive lateral interaction, can be used to explain and predict the lateral interactions between TM helices in membrane proteins. But as more and more unique interacting helices are characterized, it is becoming clear that the sequence motif paradigm is incomplete. Experimental evidence suggests that the search for sequence motifs, as mediators of TM helix dimerization, cannot solve the membrane protein folding problem alone. Here we review the current understanding in the field, as it has evolved from the paradigm of sequence motifs into a view in which the interactions between TM helices are much more complex. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Membrane protein structure and function.},

abstract = {All-atom molecular dynamics computer simulations were used to blindly predict the hydration free energies of a range of chloro-organic compounds as part of the SAMPL3 challenge. All compounds were parameterized within the framework of the OPLS-AA force field, using an established protocol to compute the absolute hydration free energy via a windowed free energy perturbation approach and thermodynamic integration. Three different approaches to deriving partial charge parameters were pursued: (1) using existing OPLS-AA atom types and charges with minor adjustments of partial charges on equivalent connecting atoms; (2) calculation of quantum mechanical charges via geometry optimization, followed by electrostatic potential (ESP) fitting, using Jaguar at the LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-F) level; and (3) via geometry optimization and CHelpG charges (Gaussian03 at the HF/6-31G* level), followed by two-stage RESP fitting. Protocol 3 generated the most accurate predictions with a root mean square (RMS) error of [Formula: see text] for the entire data set. It was found that the deficiency of the standard OPLS-AA parameters, protocol 1 (RMS error [Formula: see text] overall), was mostly due to compounds with more than three chlorine substituents on an aromatic ring. For this latter subset, the RMS errors were [Formula: see text] (protocol 3) and [Formula: see text] (protocol 1), respectively. We propose new OPLS-AA atom types for aromatic carbon and chlorine atoms in rings with ≥4 Cl-substituents that perform better than the best QM-based approach, resulting in an RMS error of [Formula: see text] for these difficult compounds.},

This allows distinguishing structures which are geometrically similar from those which are different. By analyzing microseconds-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a polypeptide, we find that a distance based on backbone dihedral angles performs very well in distinguishing structures that are kinetically correlated from those that are not, while the widely used C($\alpha$) root mean square distance performs more poorly. The root mean square difference between contact matrices turns out instead to be the metric providing the highest clustering coefficient, namely, according to this similarity measure, the neighbors of a structure are also, on average, neighbors among themselves. We also propose a combined distance measure which, for the system considered here, performs well both for distinguishing structures which are distant in time and for giving a consistent cluster analysis.},

The role of SecDF has remained unclear, although it is proposed to function in later stages of translocation as well as in membrane protein biogenesis. Here, we determined the crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus SecDF at 3.3 \AA resolution, revealing a pseudo-symmetrical, 12-helix transmembrane domain belonging to the RND superfamily and two major periplasmic domains, P1 and P4. Higher-resolution analysis of the periplasmic domains suggested that P1, which binds an unfolded protein, undergoes functionally important conformational changes. In vitro analyses identified an ATP-independent step of protein translocation that requires both SecDF and proton motive force. Electrophysiological analyses revealed that SecDF conducts protons in a manner dependent on pH and the presence of an unfolded protein, with conserved Asp and Arg residues at the transmembrane interface between SecD and SecF playing essential roles in the movements of protons and preproteins. Therefore, we propose that SecDF functions as a membrane-integrated chaperone, powered by proton motive force, to achieve ATP-independent protein translocation.},

A number of studies link voltage sensitivity to interactions of S4 charges with membrane phospholipids in the outer leaflet of the bilayer. Although the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) in the inner membrane leaflet has emerged as a universal activator of ion channels, no such role has been established for mammalian Kv channels. Here we show that PIP(2) depletion induced two kinetically distinct effects on Kv channels: an increase in voltage sensitivity and a concomitant decrease in current amplitude. These effects are reversible, exhibiting distinct molecular determinants and sensitivities to PIP(2). Gating current measurements revealed that PIP(2) constrains the movement of the sensor through interactions with the S4-S5 linker. Thus, PIP(2) controls both the movement of the voltage sensor and the stability of the open pore through interactions with the linker that connects them.},

The properties studied are the area per lipid, condensation, bilayer thickness, tail order parameters, bending modulus, and area compressibility. Our model quantitatively reproduces most of the experimental effects of cholesterol on these properties and reproduces the main features of the experimental phase and structure diagrams. We also present all-atom simulation results of the system and use these results to further validate the structure of our coarse-grained bilayer. On the basis of the changes in structural properties, we propose a temperature-composition structure diagram, which we compare with the experimental phase and structure diagrams.

abstract = {Ciona intestinalis voltage-sensing phosphatase (Ci-VSP) has transmembrane voltage sensor domain (VSD) and a cytoplasmic region sharing similarity to the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). It dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) upon membrane depolarization. The cytoplasmic region is composed of a phosphatase domain (PD) and a putatively membrane-interaction domain, C2. Here we determined the crystal structures of the Ci-VSP cytoplasmic region in three distinct constructs, wild-type (248-576), wild-type (236-576) and G365A mutant (248-576). The crystal structure of WT-236 and G365A-248 had the disulfide bond between the catalytic residue Cys363 and the adjacent residue Cys310. On the other hand, the disulfide bond was not present in the crystal structure of WT-248. These suggest the possibility that Ci-VSP is regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) as found in PTEN. These structures also revealed that the conformation of the TI loop in the active site of Ci-VSP cytoplasmic region was distinct from the corresponding region of PTEN: Ci-VSP has glutamic acid (Glu411) in the TI loop, orienting toward the center of active site pocket. Mutation of Glu411 led to acquirement of increased activity toward PtdIns(3,5)P2, suggesting that this site is required for determining substrate specificity. Our results provide the basic information of the enzymatic mechanism of Ci-VSP.},

abstract = {Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; ErbB1, HER1 in humans) is a receptor tyrosine kinase triggering signals across the plasma membranes of cells to determine cell fate. We have used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate structural models of ErbB1 ectodomains. We show that, with minor rearrangements, the ErbB1 back-to-back dimer can align almost flat on the cell membrane. This is in contrast to the traditional picture of ErbB1 dimers standing proud of the membrane, but in line with recent FRET and EM experiments. Interaction with the membrane leads to conformational changes in the dimer, which further stabilize the back-to-back interface. On the membrane, two dimers can associate forming a tetramer. This is enabled by a head-to-head interface, involving the ligand binding side of the ectodomain, and which significantly enhances ligand binding. A weak head-to-head interface has been seen in crystal structures, but is found to stabilise appreciably in our simulation. We also find that the domains IV, connecting the receptor to the membrane, weakly interact with each other. These simulations illustrate some of the flexibility of the ErbB1 ectodomains, and may help to explain recent experimental results.},

abstract = {The electrostatic properties of lipid membranes are of profound importance as they are directly associated with membrane potential and, consequently, with numerous membrane-mediated biological phenomena. Here we address a number of methodological issues related to the computation of the electrostatic potential from atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayers. We discuss two slightly different forms of Poisson equation that are normally used to calculate the membrane potential: (i) a classical form when the potential and the electric field are chosen to be zero on one of the sides of a simulation box and (ii) an alternative form, when the potential is set to be the same on the opposite sides of a simulation box. Both forms differ by a position-dependent correction term, which has been shown to be proportional to the overall dipole moment of a bilayer system (for neutral systems). For symmetric bilayers we demonstrate that both approaches give essentially the same potential profiles, provided that simulations are long enough (a production run of at least 100 ns is required) and that fluctuations of the center of mass of a bilayer are properly accounted for. In contrast, for asymmetric lipid bilayers, the second approach is no longer appropriate due to a nonzero net dipole moment across a simulation box with a single asymmetric bilayer. We demonstrate that in this case the electrostatic potential can adequately be described by the classical form of Poisson equation, provided that it is employed in conjunction with tin-foil boundary conditions, which exactly balance a nonzero surface charge of a periodically replicated multibilayer system. Furthermore, we show that vacuum boundary conditions give qualitatively similar potential profiles for asymmetric lipid bilayers as compared to the conventional periodic boundaries, but accurate determination of the transmembrane potential difference is then hindered due to detachment of some water dipoles from bulk aqueous solution to vacuum.},

We use our Protein Local Optimization Program (PLOP), which samples conformational space from first principles to build sets of loop candidates and then discriminates between them using our physics-based, all-atom energy function with implicit solvent. We also discuss a new kind of explicit membrane calculation developed for GPCR loops that interact, either in the native structure or in low-energy false-positive structures, with the membrane, and thus exist in a multiphase environment not previously incorporated in PLOP. Our results demonstrate a significant advance over previous work reported in the literature, and of particular note we are able to accurately restore the extremely long second extracellular loop (ECL2), which is also key for GPCR ligand binding. In the case of {beta}2Ar, accurate ECL2 restoration required seeding a small helix into the loop in the appropriate region, based on alignment with the {beta}1Ar ECL2 loop, and then running loop reconstruction simulations with and without the seeded helix present; simulations containing the helix attain significantly lower total energies than those without the helix, and have rmsds close to the native structure. For {beta}1Ar, the same protocol was used, except the alignment was done to {beta}2Ar. These results represent an encouraging start for the more difficult problem of accurate loop refinement for GPCR homology modeling.},

abstract = {The aggregation of amyloid-$\beta$ peptides resulting in neurotoxic oligomers is an important but yet a mysterious process in the Alzheimer's disease development. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the self-assembly of three full-length amyloid peptides in the zwitterionic dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and cholesterol mixed lipid bilayer. During the 1000ns simulation, the residues 1-27 were found to interact preferentially with the lipid-aqueous interface region while residues 28-42 show inclination to remain inside the bilayer hydrophobic tail region. The interaction between peptides and lipids has facilitated the association of A$\beta$ peptides. However, the interaction between cholesterol and peptides is inversely correlated with the extent of the peptide-peptide interactions. Our simulation has uncovered the formation of a short segment of parallel $\beta$-sheet between two peptide chains. In another chain, the N- and C-termini came close to each other. All the structural transitions indicate that our simulation has caught a glimpse of the complicated peptide oligomerization process. The full understanding of the underlying mechanism still requires further experimental and theoretical studies.},

abstract = {Methods to compute free energy differences between different states of a molecular system are reviewed with the aim of identifying their basic ingredients and their utility when applied in practice to biomolecular systems. A free energy calculation is comprised of three basic components: (i) a suitable model or Hamiltonian, (ii) a sampling protocol with which one can generate a representative ensemble of molecular configurations, and (iii) an estimator of the free energy difference itself. Alternative sampling protocols can be distinguished according to whether one or more states are to be sampled. In cases where only a single state is considered, six alternative techniques could be distinguished: (i) changing the dynamics, (ii) deforming the energy surface, (iii) extending the dimensionality, (iv) perturbing the forces, (v) reducing the number of degrees of freedom, and (vi) multi-copy approaches. In cases where multiple states are to be sampled, the three primary techniques are staging, importance sampling, and adiabatic decoupling. Estimators of the free energy can be classified as global methods that either count the number of times a given state is sampled or use energy differences. Or, they can be classified as local methods that either make use of the force or are based on transition probabilities. Finally, this overview of the available techniques and how they can be best used in a practical context is aimed at helping the reader choose the most appropriate combination of approaches for the biomolecular system, Hamiltonian and free energy difference of interest.},

abstract = {The biological function of transmembrane proteins is closely related to their insertion, which has most often been studied through their lateral mobility. For >30 years, it has been thought that hardly any information on the size of the diffusing object can be extracted from such experiments. Indeed, the hydrodynamic model developed by Saffman and Delbr\"{u}ck predicts a weak, logarithmic dependence of the diffusion coefficient D with the radius R of the protein. Despite widespread use, its validity has never been thoroughly investigated. To check this model, we measured the diffusion coefficients of various peptides and transmembrane proteins, incorporated into giant unilamellar vesicles of 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SOPC) or in model bilayers of tunable thickness. We show in this work that, for several integral proteins spanning a large range of sizes, the diffusion coefficient is strongly linked to the protein dimensions. A heuristic model results in a Stokes-like expression for D, (D proportional, variant 1/R), which fits literature data as well as ours. Diffusion measurement is then a fast and fruitful method; it allows determining the oligomerization degree of proteins or studying lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions within bilayers.},

abstract = {The GXGD proteases are polytopic membrane proteins with catalytic activities against membrane-spanning substrates that require a pair of aspartyl residues. Representative members of the family include preflagellin peptidase, type 4 prepilin peptidase, presenilin and signal peptide peptidase. Many GXGD proteases are important in medicine. For example, type 4 prepilin peptidase may contribute to bacterial pathogenesis, and mutations in presenilin are associated with Alzheimer's disease. As yet, there is no atomic-resolution structure in this protease family. Here we report the crystal structure of FlaK, a preflagellin peptidase from Methanococcus maripaludis, solved at 3.6 \AA resolution. The structure contains six transmembrane helices. The GXGD motif and a short transmembrane helix, helix 4, are positioned at the centre, surrounded by other transmembrane helices. The crystal structure indicates that the protease must undergo conformational changes to bring the GXGD motif and a second essential aspartyl residue from transmembrane helix 1 into close proximity for catalysis. A comparison of the crystal structure with models of presenilin derived from biochemical analysis reveals three common transmembrane segments that are similarly arranged around the active site. This observation reinforces the idea that the prokaryotic and human proteases are evolutionarily related. The crystal structure presented here provides a framework for understanding the mechanism of the GXGD proteases, and may facilitate the rational design of inhibitors that target specific members of the family.},

abstract = {With today's available computer power, free energy calculations from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations "via counting" become feasible for an increasing number of reactions. An example is the dimerization reaction of transmembrane alpha-helices. If an extended simulation of the two helices covers sufficiently many dimerization and dissociation events, their binding free energy is readily derived from the fraction of time during which the two helices are observed in dimeric form. Exactly how the correct value for the free energy is to be calculated, however, is unclear, and indeed several different and contradictory approaches have been used. In particular, results obtained via Boltzmann statistics differ from those determined via the law of mass action. Here, we develop a theory that resolves this discrepancy. We show that for simulation systems containing two molecules, the dimerization free energy is given by a formula of the form $\Delta$G ∝ ln(P(1) /P(0) ). Our theory is also applicable to high concentrations that typically have to be used in molecular dynamics simulations to keep the simulation system small, where the textbook dilute approximations fail. It also covers simulations with an arbitrary number of monomers and dimers and provides rigorous error estimates. Comparison with test simulations of a simple Lennard Jones system with various particle numbers as well as with reference free energy values obtained from radial distribution functions show full agreement for both binding free energies and dimerization statistics.},

abstract = {Numerous membrane importers rely on accessory water-soluble proteins to capture their substrates. These substrate-binding proteins (SBP) have a strong affinity for their ligands; yet, substrate release onto the low-affinity membrane transporter must occur for uptake to proceed. It is generally accepted that release is facilitated by the association of SBP and transporter, upon which the SBP adopts a conformation similar to the unliganded state, whose affinity is sufficiently reduced. Despite the appeal of this mechanism, however, direct supporting evidence is lacking. Here, we use experimental and theoretical methods to demonstrate that an allosteric mechanism of enhanced substrate release is indeed plausible. First, we report the atomic-resolution structure of apo TeaA, the SBP of the Na(+)-coupled ectoine TRAP transporter TeaBC from Halomonas elongata DSM2581(T), and compare it with the substrate-bound structure previously reported. Conformational free-energy landscape calculations based upon molecular dynamics simulations are then used to dissect the mechanism that couples ectoine binding to structural change in TeaA. These insights allow us to design a triple mutation that biases TeaA toward apo-like conformations without directly perturbing the binding cleft, thus mimicking the influence of the membrane transporter. Calorimetric measurements demonstrate that the ectoine affinity of the conformationally biased triple mutant is 100-fold weaker than that of the wild type. By contrast, a control mutant predicted to be conformationally unbiased displays wild-type affinity. This work thus demonstrates that substrate release from SBPs onto their membrane transporters can be facilitated by the latter through a mechanism of allosteric modulation of the former.},

In this paper, we carry on our investigation, by Monte Carlo simulations, of different aspects of cluster phases of proteins in biomembranes. First, we compare different long-range potentials (including notably three-body terms) to demonstrate that the existence of cluster phases should be quite generic. Furthermore, a real membrane contains hundreds of different protein species that are far from being randomly distributed in these nanodomains. We take this protein diversity into account by modulating protein–protein interaction potentials both at short and longer range. We confirm theoretical predictions in terms of biological cluster specialization by deciphering how clusters recruit only a few protein species. In this respect, we highlight that cluster phases can turn out to be an advantage at the biological level, for example by enhancing the cell response to external stimuli.},

Analysis of the simulation trajectories suggests that correlated motion between neighboring lipid molecules is an important aspect of lipid dynamics. The correlation among neighboring lipids within a monolayer is substantial and surprisingly long-ranged with a decay length of approximately 25 A. This provides a mechanism for the previously published observation that lateral diffusion coefficients computed from molecular dynamics simulations exhibited a strong dependence on the size of the unit cell and for the recent suggestion that lipid flows on that nanoscale are an important component of translational diffusion within membranes. Additionally, we show that diffusive motion is only weakly correlated between lipids in opposing monolayers.},

abstract = {The evolutionary trajectory of a protein through sequence space is constrained by its function. Collections of sequence homologs record the outcomes of millions of evolutionary experiments in which the protein evolves according to these constraints. Deciphering the evolutionary record held in these sequences and exploiting it for predictive and engineering purposes presents a formidable challenge. The potential benefit of solving this challenge is amplified by the advent of inexpensive high-throughput genomic sequencing.
        In this paper we ask whether we can infer evolutionary constraints from a set of sequence homologs of a protein. The challenge is to distinguish true co-evolution couplings from the noisy set of observed correlations. We address this challenge using a maximum entropy model of the protein sequence, constrained by the statistics of the multiple sequence alignment, to infer residue pair couplings. Surprisingly, we find that the strength of these inferred couplings is an excellent predictor of residue-residue proximity in folded structures. Indeed, the top-scoring residue couplings are sufficiently accurate and well-distributed to define the 3D protein fold with remarkable accuracy.
        We quantify this observation by computing, from sequence alone, all-atom 3D structures of fifteen test proteins from different fold classes, ranging in size from 50 to 260 residues., including a G-protein coupled receptor. These blinded inferences are de novo, i.e., they do not use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The co-evolution signals provide sufficient information to determine accurate 3D protein structure to 2.7–4.8 \AA C$\alpha$-RMSD error relative to the observed structure, over at least two-thirds of the protein (method called EVfold, details at http://EVfold.org). This discovery provides insight into essential interactions constraining protein evolution and will facilitate a comprehensive survey of the universe of protein structures, new strategies in protein and drug design, and the identification of functional genetic variants in normal and disease genomes.},

Kinetic parameters were extracted using a three-state hidden Markov model to identify transition rates between free, co-confined and dimerized states. We report that dimers composed of two ligand-bound receptors are long-lived and their k(off) is independent of kinase activity. By comparison, unliganded dimers have a more than four times faster k(off). Transient co-confinement of receptors promotes repeated encounters and enhances dimer formation. Mobility decreases more than six times when ligand-bound receptors dimerize. Blockade of erbB1 kinase activity or disruption of actin networks results in faster diffusion of receptor dimers. These results implicate both signal propagation and the cortical cytoskeleton in reduced mobility of signaling-competent erbB1 dimers.},

abstract = {Atomic positions obtained by X-ray crystallography are time and space averages over many molecules in the crystal. Importantly, interatomic distances, calculated between such average positions and frequently used in structural and mechanistic analyses, can be substantially different from the more appropriate time-average and ensemble-average interatomic distances. Using crystallographic B-factors, one can deduce corrections, which have so far been applied exclusively to small molecules, to obtain correct average distances as a function of the type of atomic motion. Here, using 4774 high-quality protein X-ray structures, we study the significance of such corrections for different types of atomic motion. Importantly, we show that for distances shorter than 5 \AA, corrections greater than 0.5 \AA may apply, especially for noncorrelated or anticorrelated motion. For example, 14% of the studied structures have at least one pair of atoms with a correction of ≥0.5 \AA in the case of noncorrelated motion. Using molecular dynamics simulations of villin headpiece, ubiquitin, and SH3 domain unit cells, we demonstrate that the majority of average interatomic distances in these proteins agree with noncorrelated corrections, suggesting that such deviations may be truly relevant. Importantly, we demonstrate that the corrections do not significantly affect stereochemistry and the overall quality of final refined X-ray structures, but can provide marked improvements in starting unrefined models obtained from low-resolution X-ray data. Finally, we illustrate the potential mechanistic and biological significance of the calculated corrections for KcsA ion channel and show that they provide indirect evidence that motions in its selectivity filter are highly correlated.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated sodium (Na(V)) channels initiate electrical signalling in excitable cells and are the molecular targets for drugs and disease mutations, but the structural basis for their voltage-dependent activation, ion selectivity and drug block is unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of a voltage-gated Na(+) channel from Arcobacter butzleri (NavAb) captured in a closed-pore conformation with four activated voltage sensors at 2.7 \AA resolution. The arginine gating charges make multiple hydrophilic interactions within the voltage sensor, including unanticipated hydrogen bonds to the protein backbone. Comparisons to previous open-pore potassium channel structures indicate that the voltage-sensor domains and the S4-S5 linkers dilate the central pore by pivoting together around a hinge at the base of the pore module. The NavAb selectivity filter is short, ∼4.6 \AA wide, and water filled, with four acidic side chains surrounding the narrowest part of the ion conduction pathway. This unique structure presents a high-field-strength anionic coordination site, which confers Na(+) selectivity through partial dehydration via direct interaction with glutamate side chains. Fenestrations in the sides of the pore module are unexpectedly penetrated by fatty acyl chains that extend into the central cavity, and these portals are large enough for the entry of small, hydrophobic pore-blocking drugs. This structure provides the template for understanding electrical signalling in excitable cells and the actions of drugs used for pain, epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia at the atomic level.},

In total, 300 million atoms in a periodic cube with an edge length of 148.5 nm were simulated.

With the tremendous computational power of GPUs, efficient software packages for various hardware designs, and consistent physical models, more challenging applications will be carried out in the near future.},

abstract = {It is well-established that native plasma membranes are characterized by an asymmetric distribution of charged (anionic) lipids across the membrane. To clarify how the asymmetry can affect membrane electrostatics, we have performed extensive atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations of asymmetric lipid membranes composed of zwitterionic (phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)) and anionic (phosphatidylserine (PS)) leaflets. It turns out that the asymmetry in transmembrane distribution of anionic lipids gives rise to a nonzero potential difference between the two sides of the membrane. This potential arises from the difference in surface charges of the two leaflets. The magnitude of the intrinsic membrane potential was found to be 238 mV and 198 mV for PS/PC and PS/PE membranes, respectively. Remarkably, this potential is of the same sign as the membrane potential in cells. Our findings, being in reasonable agreement with available experimental data, lend support to the idea that the transmembrane lipid asymmetry typical of most living cells contributes to the membrane potential.},

Using cellobiose from the recently published MARTINI coarse-grained force field for carbohydrates [ Lopez, C. A. et al. J. Chem.

By extrapolating the model to longer cellooligomers, and by assigning special cellulose−cellulose nonbonded interactions, we obtain a model which gives a stable, ordered structure in water that closely resembles the crystal structure of cellulose I$\beta$. Furthermore, the resulting model is compatible with an existing coarse-grained force field for proteins. This is demonstrated by a simulation of the motion of the carbohydrate-binding domain of the fungal cellulase Cel7A from Trichoderma reesei on a crystalline cellulose surface. The diffusion coefficient at room temperature is calculated at Dl = 3.1 × 10−11 cm2 s−1, which is in good agreement with experimental numbers.},

The implicit membrane model was also used to study the effect of different membrane thicknesses by scaling the low-dielectric region. The conformational sampling with the membrane model mimicking dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers is in good agreement overall with experimental measurements, but consists of a wide variety of different conformations including structures not described previously.

abstract = {High-conductance voltage- and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels function in many physiological processes that link cell membrane voltage and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, including neuronal electrical activity, skeletal and smooth muscle contraction, and hair cell tuning. Like other voltage-dependent K(+) channels, Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels open when the cell membrane depolarizes, but in contrast to other voltage-dependent K(+) channels, they also open when intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations rise. Channel opening by Ca(2+) is made possible by a structure called the gating ring, which is located in the cytoplasm. Recent structural studies have defined the Ca(2+)-free, closed, conformation of the gating ring, but the Ca(2+)-bound, open, conformation is not yet known. Here we present the Ca(2+)-bound conformation of the gating ring. This structure shows how one layer of the gating ring, in response to the binding of Ca(2+), opens like the petals of a flower. The degree to which it opens explains how Ca(2+) binding can open the transmembrane pore. These findings present a molecular basis for Ca(2+) activation of K(+) channels and suggest new possibilities for targeting the gating ring to treat conditions such as asthma and hypertension.},

abstract = {Transmembrane $\alpha$-helices play a key role in many receptors, transmitting a signal from one side to the other of the lipid bilayer membrane. Bacterial chemoreceptors are one of the best studied such systems, with a wealth of biophysical and mutational data indicating a key role for the TM2 helix in signalling. In particular, aromatic (Trp and Tyr) and basic (Arg) residues help to lock $\alpha$-helices into a membrane. Mutants in TM2 of E. coli Tar and related chemoreceptors involving these residues implicate changes in helix location and/or orientation in signalling. We have investigated the detailed structural basis of this via high throughput coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) of Tar TM2 and its mutants in lipid bilayers. We focus on the position (shift) and orientation (tilt, rotation) of TM2 relative to the bilayer and how these are perturbed in mutants relative to the wildtype. The simulations reveal a clear correlation between small (ca. 1.5 \AA) shift in position of TM2 along the bilayer normal and downstream changes in signalling activity. Weaker correlations are seen with helix tilt, and little/none between signalling and helix twist. This analysis of relatively subtle changes was only possible because the high throughput simulation method allowed us to run large (n = 100) ensembles for substantial numbers of different helix sequences, amounting to ca. 2000 simulations in total. Overall, this analysis supports a swinging-piston model of transmembrane signalling by Tar and related chemoreceptors.},

We now experimentally study the direct consequences of mismatching of transmembrane peptides of different length with bilayers of different thicknesses at the molecular level. In both model membranes and simulations we show that cholesterol critically constrains structural adaptations at the peptide-lipid interface under mismatch.

abstract = {The elastic network interpolation (ENI) (Kim et al., Biophys J 2002;83:1620-1630) is a computationally efficient and physically realistic method to generate conformational transition intermediates between two forms of a given protein. However it can be asked whether these calculated conformations provide good representatives for these intermediates. In this study, we use ENI to generate conformational transition intermediates between the open form and the closed form of adenylate kinase (AK). Based on C(alpha)-only intermediates, we construct atomic intermediates by grafting all the atoms of known AK structures onto the C(alpha) atoms and then perform CHARMM energy minimization to remove steric conflicts and optimize these intermediate structures. We compare the energy profiles for all intermediates from both the CHARMM force-field and from knowledge-based energy functions. We find that the CHARMM energies can successfully capture the two energy minima representing the open AK and closed AK forms, while the energies computed from the knowledge-based energy functions can detect the local energy minimum representing the closed AK form and show some general features of the transition pathway with a somewhat similar energy profile as the CHARMM energies. The combinatorial extension structural alignment (Shindyalov et al., 1998;11:739-747) and the k-means clustering algorithm are then used to show that known PDB structures closely resemble computed intermediates along the transition pathway.},

abstract = {We present general algorithms for the compression of molecular dynamics trajectories. The standard ways to store MD trajectories as text or as raw binary floating point numbers result in very large files when efficient simulation programs are used on supercomputers. Our algorithms are based on the observation that differences in atomic coordinates/velocities, in either time or space, are generally smaller than the absolute values of the coordinates/velocities. Also, it is often possible to store values at a lower precision. We apply several compression schemes to compress the resulting differences further. The most efficient algorithms developed here use a block sorting algorithm in combination with Huffman coding. Depending on the frequency of storage of frames in the trajectory, either space, time, or combinations of space and time differences are usually the most efficient. We compare the efficiency of our algorithms with each other and with other algorithms present in the literature for various systems: liquid argon, water, a virus capsid solvated in 15 mM aqueous NaCl, and solid magnesium oxide. We perform tests to determine how much precision is necessary to obtain accurate structural and dynamic properties, as well as benchmark a parallelized implementation of the algorithms. We obtain compression ratios (compared to single precision floating point) of 1:3.3-1:35 depending on the frequency of storage of frames and the system studied.},

abstract = {The conformation and functions of proteins are closely linked, and many proteins undergo conformational changes upon ligand binding. The X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed conformational differences in proteins between the liganded and unliganded states. Currently, the conformational transitions that originate in the ligand binding are explained on the basis of two representative models, the induced-fit and preexisting equilibrium dynamics models. However, the actual dynamics of the proteins remain ambiguous. Though these two models are the extreme ones, it is important to understand the difference between these two, particularly in structural biology and medicinal chemistry studies. Here, we clarified the difference in the mechanisms responsible for the conformational changes induced in two proteins upon ligand binding by examining computationally determined free-energy profiles of the apo- and holoproteins. The lysine/arginine/ornithine-binding protein and maltose/maltodextrin-binding protein were chosen as the target proteins, and the energy profiles were generated by a molecular simulation approach. Our results revealed that fluctuations in the apo state and protein-ligand interactions both play important roles in conformational transition, and the mechanism is highly influenced by the fluctuations in the apo state, which are unique to a particular structure.},

Mutations that alter the position or orientation of an $\alpha$-helix within a membrane, or that change the probability that the $\alpha$-helix will insert into the membrane, can alter a range of membrane protein functions. We describe a comparative coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation methodology, based on self-assembly of a lipid bilayer in the presence of an $\alpha$-helical peptide, which allows us to model membrane transmembrane helix insertion. We validate this methodology against available experimental data for synthetic model peptides (WALP23 and LS3). Simulation-based estimates of apparent free energies of insertion into a bilayer of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator-derived helices correlate well with published data for translocon-mediated insertion. Comparison of values of the apparent free energy of insertion from self-assembly simulations with those from coarse-grained molecular dynamics potentials of mean force for model peptides, and with translocon-mediated insertion of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator-derived peptides suggests a nonequilibrium model of helix insertion into bilayers.},

The lateral diffusion constant Dl is 2.92 x 10(-7) and 0.95 x 10(-7) cm2/s for 72 and 288 lipids, respectively. This dramatic finite size effect originates from the correlation length of lipid diffusion, which extends to next-nearest neighbors in the 288 lipid system. Consequently, diffusional events in smaller systems can propagate across the boundaries of the periodic box. The internal dynamics of lipids calculated from the PME simulations are independent of the system size. Specifically, reorientational correlation functions for the slowly relaxing phosphorus-glycerol hydrogen, phosphorus-nitrogen vectors, and more rapidly relaxing CH vectors in the aliphatic chains are equivalent for the 72 and 288 lipid simulations. A third MD simulation of a bilayer with 72 lipids using spherical force-shift electrostatic cutoffs resulted in interdigitated chains, thereby rendering this cutoff method inappropriate.},

abstract = {Membrane fusion is required for diverse biological functions ranging from viral infection to neurotransmitter release. Fusogenic proteins increase the intrinsically slow rate of fusion by coupling energetically downhill conformational changes of the protein to kinetically unfavorable fusion of the membrane-phospholipid bilayers. Class I viral fusogenic proteins have an N-terminal hydrophobic fusion peptide (FP) domain, important for interaction with the target membrane, plus a C-terminal transmembrane (C-term-TM) helical membrane anchor. The role of the water-soluble regions of fusogenic proteins has been extensively studied, but the contributions of the membrane-interacting FP and C-term-TM peptides are less well characterized. Typically, FPs are thought to bind to membranes at an angle that allows helix penetration but not traversal of the lipid bilayer. Here, we show that the FP from the paramyxovirus parainfluenza virus 5 fusogenic protein, F, forms an N-terminal TM helix, which self-associates into a hexameric bundle. This FP also interacts strongly with the C-term-TM helix. Thus, the fusogenic F protein resembles SNARE proteins involved in vesicle fusion by having water-soluble coiled coils that zipper during fusion and TM helices in both membranes. By analogy to mechanosensitive channels, the force associated with zippering of the water-soluble coiled-coil domain is expected to lead to tilting of the FP helices, promoting interaction with the C-term-TM helices. The energetically unfavorable dehydration of lipid headgroups of opposing bilayers is compensated by thermodynamically favorable interactions between the FP and C-term-TM helices as the coiled coils zipper into the membrane phase, leading to a pore lined by both lipid and protein.},

Although antibodies that bind to this core GP41 epitope can be elicited, they lack neutralizing activity. To understand this paradox, we used biophysical methods to investigate the binding of human 2F5 to the MPER in a membrane environment, where it resides in vivo. Recognition is stepwise, through a paratope more extensive than core binding site contacts alone, and dynamic rearrangement through an apparent scoop-like movement of heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRH3) is essential for MPER extraction from the viral membrane. Core-epitope recognition on the virus requires the induction of conformational changes in both the MPER and the paratope. Hence, target neutralization through this lipid-embedded viral segment places stringent requirements on the plasticity of the antibody combining site.},

abstract = {Cys-loop receptors constitute a superfamily of ion channels gated by ligands such as acetylcholine, serotonin, glycine, and $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid. All of these receptors are thought to share structural characteristics, but due to high sequence variation and limited structure availability, our knowledge about allosteric binding sites is still limited. These sites are frequent targets of anesthetic and alcohol molecules, and are of high pharmacological importance. We used molecular simulations to study ethanol binding and equilibrium exchange for the homomeric $\alpha$1 glycine receptor (GlyR$\alpha$1), modeled on the structure of the Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand-gated channel. Ethanol has a well-known potentiating effect and can be used in high concentrations. By performing two microsecond-scale simulations of GlyR with/without ethanol, we were able to observe spontaneous binding in cavities and equilibrium ligand exchange. Of interest, it appears that there are ethanol-binding sites both between and within the GlyR transmembrane subunits, with the intersubunit site having the highest occupancy and slowest exchange (∼200 ns). This model site involves several residues that were previously identified via mutations as being crucial for potentiation. Finally, ethanol appears to stabilize the GlyR model built on a presumably open form of the ligand-gated channel. This stabilization could help explain the effects of allosteric ligand binding in Cys-loop receptors.},

This has resulted in a view of bilayers as being adaptive rather than purely hydrophobic solvents, with important implications, for example, for interaction between lipids and arginines in the charged S4 helix of voltage-gated ion channels. However, several studies indicate that the typical current simulations fall short of exhaustive sampling, and that even simple protein-membrane interactions require at least ca. 1 micros to fully sample their dynamics. One new way this is being addressed is coarse-grained models that enable mesoscopic simulations on multi-micros scale. These have been used to model interactions, self-assembly and membrane perturbations induced by proteins. While they cannot replace all-atom simulations, they are a potentially useful technique for initial insertion, placement, and low-resolution refinement.},

abstract = {Crystal structures of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with bound ligand revealed symmetric, doubly ligated receptor dimers thought to represent physiologically active states. Such complexes fail to rationalize negative cooperativity of epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding to EGFR and the behavior of the ligandless EGFR homolog ErbB2/HER2, however. We report cell-based assays that provide evidence for active, singly ligated dimers of human EGFR and its homolog, ErbB4/HER4. We also report crystal structures of the ErbB4/HER4 extracellular region complexed with its ligand Neuregulin-1$\beta$ that resolve two types of ErbB dimer when compared to EGFR:Ligand complexes. One type resembles the recently reported asymmetric dimer of Drosophila EGFR with a single high-affinity ligand bound and provides a model for singly ligated human ErbB dimers. These results unify models of vertebrate and invertebrate EGFR/ErbB signaling, imply that the tethered conformation of unliganded ErbBs evolved to prevent crosstalk among ErbBs, and establish a molecular basis for both negative cooperativity of ligand binding to vertebrate ErbBs and the absence of active ErbB2/HER2 homodimers in normal conditions.},

abstract = {Gramicidin A (gA) channels provide an ideal system to test molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of membrane proteins. The peptide backbone lines a cation-selective pore, and due to the small channel size, the average structure and extent of fluctuations of all atoms in the peptide will influence ion permeation. This raises the question of how well molecular mechanical force fields used in MD simulations and potential of mean force (PMF) calculations can predict structure and dynamics as well as ion permeation. To address this question, we undertook a comparative study of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) observables predicted by fully atomistic MD simulations on a gA dimer embedded in a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelle with measurements of the gA dimer backbone and tryptophan side chain dynamics using solution-state (15)N NMR on gA dimers in SDS micelles (Vostrikov, V. V.; Gu, H.; Ingólfsson, H. I.; Hinton, J. F.; Andersen, O. S.; Roux, B.; Koeppe, R. E., II. J. Phys. Chem. B2011, DOI 10.1021/jp200906y , accompanying article). This comparison enables us to examine the robustness of the MD simulations done using different force fields as well as their ability to predict important features of the gA channel. We find that MD is able to predict NMR observables, including the generalized order parameters (S(2)), the (15)N spin-lattice (T(1)) and spin-spin (T(2)) relaxation times, and the (1)H-(15)N nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE), with remarkable accuracy. To examine further how differences in the force fields can affect the channel conductance, we calculated the PMF for K(+) and Na(+) permeation through a gA channel in a dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayer. In this case, we find that MD is less successful in quantitatively predicting the single-channel conductance.},

abstract = {The accurate modeling of protein dynamics in crystalline states is essential for the development of computational techniques for simulating protein dynamics under physiological conditions. Following a previous coarse-grained modeling study of atomic fluctuations in protein crystal structures, we have refined our modeling with all-atom representation and force field. We have calculated the anisotropic atomic fluctuations of a protein structure interacting with its crystalline environment either explicitly (by including neighboring proteins into modeling) or implicitly (by adding harmonic restraints to surface atoms involved in crystal contacts). The modeling results are assessed in comparison with the experimental anisotropic displacement parameters (ADP) determined by X-ray crystallography. For a list of 40 high-resolution protein crystal structures, we have found that the optimal modeling of ADPs is achieved when the protein-environment interactions are much weaker than the internal interactions within a protein structure. Therefore, the intrinsic dynamics of a protein structure is only weakly perturbed by crystal packing. We have also found no noticeable improvement in the accuracy of ADP modeling by using all-atom over coarse-grained representation and force field, which justifies the use of coarse-grained modeling to investigate protein dynamics with both efficiency and accuracy.},

Integrin activation comprises triggering events, intermediate signalling events and, finally, the interaction of integrins with cytoplasmic regulators, which changes an integrin's affinity for its ligands. The first two events involve diverse interacting signalling pathways, whereas the final steps are immediately proximal to integrins, thus enabling integrin-focused therapeutic strategies. Recent progress provides insight into the structure of integrin transmembrane domains, and reveals how the final steps of integrin activation are mediated by integrin-binding proteins such as talins and kindlins.},

On average, 100 chemical bonds are processively hydrolyzed, at 15-hertz rates, before lysozyme returns to its nonproductive, 330-hertz hinge motion. Statistical analysis differentiated single-step hinge closure from enzyme opening, which requires two steps. Seven independent time scales governing lysozyme’s activity were observed. The pH dependence of lysozyme activity arises not from changes to its processive kinetics but rather from increasing time spent in either nonproductive rapid motions or an inactive, closed conformation.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated Na(+)-channels are transmembrane proteins that are responsible for the fast depolarizing phase of the action potential in nerve and muscular cells. Selective permeability of Na(+) over Ca(2+) or K(+) ions is essential for the biological function of Na(+)-channels. After the emergence of the first high-resolution structure of a Na(+)-channel, an anionic coordination site was proposed to confer Na(+) selectivity through partial dehydration of Na(+) via its direct interaction with conserved glutamate side chains. By combining molecular dynamics simulations and free-energy calculations, a low-energy permeation pathway for Na(+) ion translocation through the selectivity filter of the recently determined crystal structure of a prokaryotic sodium channel from Arcobacter butzleri is characterised. The picture that emerges is that of a pore preferentially occupied by two ions, which can switch between different configurations by crossing low free-energy barriers. In contrast to K(+)-channels, the movements of the ions appear to be weakly coupled in Na(+)-channels. When the free-energy maps for Na(+) and K(+) ions are compared, a selective site is characterised in the narrowest region of the filter, where a hydrated Na(+) ion, and not a hydrated K(+) ion, is energetically stable.},

EM 2D averages and 3D reconstructions of the detergent-solubilized complex reveal an overall architecture that is in very good agreement with the crystal structure of the active-state ternary complex. Strikingly however, the $\alpha$-helical domain of G$\alpha$s appears highly flexible in the absence of nucleotide. In contrast, the presence of the pyrophosphate mimic foscarnet (phosphonoformate), and also the presence of GDP, favor the stabilization of the $\alpha$-helical domain on the Ras-like domain of G$\alpha$s. Molecular modeling of the $\alpha$-helical domain in the 3D EM maps suggests that in its stabilized form it assumes a conformation reminiscent to the one observed in the crystal structure of G$\alpha$s-GTP$\gamma$S. These data argue that the $\alpha$-helical domain undergoes a nucleotide-dependent transition from a flexible to a conformationally stabilized state.},

We found all six mutants to be in the same 'locally closed' conformation using X-ray crystallography, sharing most of the features of the open form but showing a locally closed pore as a result of a concerted bending of all of its M2 helices. The mutants adopt several variant conformations of the M2-M3 loop, and in all cases an interacting lipid that is observed in the open form disappears. A single cross-linked mutant is functional, according to electrophysiology, and the locally closed structure of this mutant indicates that it has an increased flexibility. Further cross-linking, accessibility and molecular dynamics data suggest that the locally closed form is a functionally relevant conformation that occurs during allosteric gating transitions.},

These fibrils are associated with numerous pathologies as well as with normal cellular functions, and frequently form during protein denaturation. Inhibitors of pathological amyloid fibril formation could be useful in the development of therapeutics, provided that the inhibitors were specific enough to avoid interfering with normal processes. Here we show that computer-aided, structure-based design can yield highly specific peptide inhibitors of amyloid formation. Using known atomic structures of segments of amyloid fibrils as templates, we have designed and characterized an all-d-amino-acid inhibitor of the fibril formation of the tau protein associated with Alzheimer's disease, and a non-natural l-amino-acid inhibitor of an amyloid fibril that enhances sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. Our results indicate that peptides from structure-based designs can disrupt the fibril formation of full-length proteins, including those, such as tau protein, that lack fully ordered native structures. Because the inhibiting peptides have been designed on structures of dual-$\beta$-sheet 'steric zippers', the successful inhibition of amyloid fibril formation strengthens the hypothesis that amyloid spines contain steric zippers.},

The results of the simulation were compared to those of an analogous system using normal three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions. Analysis of the dynamics and electrostatics of the system show that slab geometric periodicity eliminates the artificial bulk water orientational polarization that is present while using normal three-dimensional periodicity. Furthermore, even though the water occupancy and volume of our simple channel is the same when using either method, the electrostatic properties are considerably different when using slab geometry. In particular, the orientational polarization of water is seen to be different in the interior of the channel. This gives rise to a markedly different electric field within the channel. We discuss the implications of slab geometry for the future simulation of this type of system and for the study of channel transport properties.},

abstract = {A large range of debilitating medical conditions is linked to protein misfolding, which may compete with productive folding particularly in proteins containing multiple domains. Seventy-five per cent of the eukaryotic proteome consists of multidomain proteins, yet it is not understood how interdomain misfolding is avoided. It has been proposed that maintaining low sequence identity between covalently linked domains is a mechanism to avoid misfolding. Here we use single-molecule F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer to detect and quantify rare misfolding events in tandem immunoglobulin domains from the I band of titin under native conditions. About 5.5 per cent of molecules with identical domains misfold during refolding in vitro and form an unexpectedly stable state with an unfolding half-time of several days. Tandem arrays of immunoglobulin-like domains in humans show significantly lower sequence identity between neighbouring domains than between non-adjacent domains. In particular, the sequence identity of neighbouring domains has been found to be preferentially below 40 per cent. We observe no misfolding for a tandem of naturally neighbouring domains with low sequence identity (24 per cent), whereas misfolding occurs between domains that are 42 per cent identical. Coarse-grained molecular simulations predict the formation of domain-swapped structures that are in excellent agreement with the observed transfer efficiency of the misfolded species. We infer that the interactions underlying misfolding are very specific and result in a sequence-specific domain-swapping mechanism. Diversifying the sequence between neighbouring domains seems to be a successful evolutionary strategy to avoid misfolding in multidomain proteins.},

@article{Chiantia2012,
abstract = {A long-standing question about membrane structure and function is the degree to which the physical properties of the inner and outer leaflets of a bilayer are coupled to one another. Using our recently developed methods to prepare asymmetric vesicles, coupling was investigated for vesicles containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the inner leaflet and sphingomyelin (SM) in the outer leaflet. The coupling of both lateral diffusion and membrane order was monitored as a function of PC and SM acyl chain structure. The presence in the outer leaflet of brain SM, which decreased outer-leaflet lateral diffusion, had little effect upon lateral diffusion in inner leaflets composed of dioleoyl PC (i.e., diffusion was only weakly coupled in the two leaflets) but did greatly reduce lateral diffusion in inner leaflets composed of PC with one saturated and one oleoyl acyl chain (i.e., diffusion was strongly coupled in these cases). In addition, reduced outer-leaflet diffusion upon introduction of outer-leaflet milk SM or a synthetic C24:0 SM, both of which have long interdigitating acyl chains, also greatly reduce diffusion of inner leaflets composed of dioleoyl PC, indicative of strong coupling. Strikingly, several assays showed that the ordering of the outer leaflet induced by the presence of SM was not reflected in increased lipid order in the inner leaflet, i.e., there was no detectable coupling between inner and outer leaflet membrane order. We propose a model for how lateral diffusion can be coupled in opposite leaflets and discuss how this might impact membrane function.},

abstract = {The reasons for distortions from optimal $\alpha$-helical geometry are widely unknown, but their influences on structural changes of proteins are significant. Hence, their prediction is a crucial problem in structural bioinformatics. For the particular case of kink prediction, we generated a data set of 132 membrane proteins containing 1014 manually labeled helices and examined the environment of kinks. Our sequence analysis confirms the great relevance of proline and reveals disproportionately high occurrences of glycine and serine at kink positions. The structural analysis shows significantly different solvent accessible surface area mean values for kinked and nonkinked helices. More important, we used this data set to validate string kernels for support vector machines as a new kink prediction method. Applying the new predictor, about 80% of all helices could be correctly predicted as kinked or nonkinked even when focusing on small helical fragments. The results exceed recently reported accuracies of alternative approaches and are a consequence of both the method and the data set.},

abstract = {Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels from the Cys-loop family mediate fast chemo-electrical transduction, but the mechanisms of ion permeation and gating of these membrane proteins remain elusive. Here we present the X-ray structure at 2.9 A resolution of the bacterial Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel homologue (GLIC) at pH 4.6 in an apparently open conformation. This cationic channel is known to be permanently activated by protons. The structure is arranged as a funnel-shaped transmembrane pore widely open on the outer side and lined by hydrophobic residues. On the inner side, a 5 A constriction matches with rings of hydrophilic residues that are likely to contribute to the ionic selectivity. Structural comparison with ELIC, a bacterial homologue from Erwinia chrysanthemi solved in a presumed closed conformation, shows a wider pore where the narrow hydrophobic constriction found in ELIC is removed. Comparative analysis of GLIC and ELIC reveals, in concert, a rotation of each extracellular beta-sandwich domain as a rigid body, interface rearrangements, and a reorganization of the transmembrane domain, involving a tilt of the M2 and M3 alpha-helices away from the pore axis. These data are consistent with a model of pore opening based on both quaternary twist and tertiary deformation.},

abstract = {Kinase large-scale conformational rearrangement is an issue of enormous biological and pharmacological relevance. Atomistic simulations able to capture the dynamics and the energetics of kinase large-scale motions are still in their infancy. Here, we present a computational study in which the atomistic dynamics of the "open-to-closed" movement of the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) have been simulated. Simulations were carried out using a new sampling method that is able to find the lowest free-energy channel between an initial state and a final state. This large-scale movement has a two-step mechanism: first, the alphaC-helix rotates by approximately 45 degrees , allowing the interaction between Glu51 and Arg149; then the CDK5 activation loop refolds to assume the closed conformation. We have also estimated the free-energy profile associated with the global motion and identified a CDK5 intermediate, which could be exploited for drug-design purposes. Our new sampling method turned out to be well-suited for investigating at an atomistic level the energetics and dynamics of kinase large-scale conformational motions.},

@article{Dror2011,
abstract = {A third of marketed drugs act by binding to a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and either triggering or preventing receptor activation. Although recent crystal structures have provided snapshots of both active and inactive functional states of GPCRs, these structures do not reveal the mechanism by which GPCRs transition between these states. Here we propose an activation mechanism for the $\beta$2-adrenergic receptor, a prototypical GPCR, based on atomic-level simulations in which an agonist-bound receptor transitions spontaneously from the active to the inactive crystallographically observed conformation. A loosely coupled allosteric network, comprising three regions that can each switch individually between multiple distinct conformations, links small perturbations at the extracellular drug-binding site to large conformational changes at the intracellular G-protein-binding site. Our simulations also exhibit an intermediate that may represent a receptor conformation to which a G protein binds during activation, and suggest that the first structural changes during receptor activation often take place on the intracellular side of the receptor, far from the drug-binding site. By capturing this fundamental signaling process in atomic detail, our results may provide a foundation for the design of drugs that control receptor signaling more precisely by stabilizing specific receptor conformations.},

@article{Webster2012,
abstract = {Muscle acetylcholine receptor ion channels mediate neurotransmission by depolarising the post-synaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction. Inherited disorders of neuromuscular transmission, termed congenital myasthenic syndromes, are commonly caused by mutations in genes encoding the five subunits of the AChR that severely reduce endplate AChR numbers and/or cause kinetic abnormalities of AChR function. We tracked the cause of the myasthenic disorder in a woman with onset of first symptoms at birth, who displayed mildly progressive bulbar, respiratory and generalised limb weakness with ptosis and ophthalmoplegia. Direct DNA sequencing revealed heteroallelic mutations in exon 8 of the AChR epsilon subunit gene. On one allele there is the missense substitution p.$\epsilon$P282R, and on the second allele a deletion, c.798_800delCTT, that results in the loss of a single amino acid, residue F266, within the M2 transmembrane domain. When AChR harbouring these mutations were expressed in HEK 293 cells, the p.$\epsilon$P282R mutation caused severely reduced expression on the cell surface whereas p.$\epsilon$$\Delta$F266 gave robust surface expression. Single channel analysis for p.$\epsilon$$\Delta$F266 AChR channels showed the longest burst duration population was not different from wild type AChR (4.39 ± 0.6 ms vs. 4.68 ± 0.7 ms, n= 5 each) but that the amplitude of channel openings was reduced. Channel amplitudes at different holding potentials showed that single channel conductance was significantly reduced in p.$\epsilon$$\Delta$F266 AChR channels (42.7 ± 1.4 pS, n= 8, compared with 70.9 ± 1.6 pS for wild type, n=6). Although a phenylalanine residue at this position within M2 is conserved through-out ligand gated excitatory cys-loop channel subunits, deletion of equivalent residues in the other subunits of muscle AChR did not have equivalent effects. Modelling the impact of p.$\epsilon$$\Delta$F266 revealed only a minor alteration to channel structure. In this study we uncover the novel mechanism of reduced AChR channel conductance as an underlying cause of congenital myasthenic syndrome, with the ‘low conductance’ phenotype that results from the p.$\epsilon$$\Delta$F266 deletion mutation revealed by the coinheritance of the low expressor mutation p.$\epsilon$P282R.},

abstract = {NhaA from Escherichia coli is a prototypical sodium/proton antiporter that regulates pH, cell volume and sodium homeostasis. We have solved the crystal structure of NhaA at 3.5\AA in a novel crystal form in which the protein packs as a physiologically relevant dimer. MD simulations show how the dimer is likely to be positioned in the membrane. A number of conserved charged residues at the centre of the protein are known to be important in the mechanism. Asp163, Asp164 and Asp133 have been suggested as being involved in sodium binding and Asp133 and Lys300 are thought to be important in charge neutralization of a crossover helix assembly. In the new structure we observe the amino group of Lys300 to be located 10\AA from its previously annotated position to lie in exactly the same position as a sodium ion in a structural homologue of NhaA, ASBTNM. Thus, a positive charge at this position is probably an important feature of this structural family. Importantly for NhaA, Lys300 now also forms a salt bridge with Asp163, one of the putative sodium coordinating residues. In molecular dynamics simulations the salt bridge between Lys300 and Asp163 is maintained over a 1 µs time scale unless sodium binds to Asp164, at which point Asp163 reorients to interact with the sodium ion instead. The results suggest a modified model for the transport mechanism of NhaA, in which salt bridges with Lys300 act as electrostatic switches.},

abstract = {All-atom molecular dynamics computer simulations were used to blindly predict the hydration free energies of a range of chloro-organic compounds as part of the SAMPL3 challenge. All compounds were parameterized within the frame- work of the OPLS-AA force field, using an established protocol to compute the ab- solute hydration free energy via a windowed free energy perturbation approach and thermodynamic integration. Three different approaches to deriving partial charge pa- rameters were pursued: (1) using existing OPLS-AA atom types and charges with minor adjustments of partial charges on equivalent connecting atoms; (2) calculation of quantum mechanical charges via geometry optimization, followed by electrostatic potential (ESP) fitting, using Jaguar at the LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-F) level; and (3) via ge- ometry optimization and CHelpG charges (Gaussian03 at the HF/6-31G* level), fol- lowed by two-stage RESP fitting. Protocol 3 generated the most accurate predictions with a root mean square (RMS) error of 1.2 kcal·mol−1 for the entire data set. It was found that the deficiency of the standard OPLS-AA parameters, protocol 1 (RMS error 2.4 kcal·mol−1 overall), was mostly due to compounds with more than three chlorine substituents on an aromatic ring. For this latter subset, the RMS errors were 1.4 kcal·mol−1 (protocol 3) and 4.3 kcal·mol−1 (protocol 1), respectively. We propose new OPLS-AA atom types for aromatic carbon and chlorine atoms in rings with ≥ 4 Cl-substituents that perform better than the best QM-based approach, resulting in an RMS error of 1.2 kcal·mol−1 for these difficult compounds.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels form potassium selective pores in cell membranes. They open or close (gate) in response to changes in the transmembrane (TM) potential and are essential for generating action potentials and the functioning of the heart and brain of mammals. Structures of several open mammalian Kv channels are known and a hypothesis for how they close has been proposed. There is, however, no general hypothesis explaining how they open. Here we show that the Kv1.2/2.1 chimaera is frustrated when closed. Our free energy molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the pore-lining (S6) helices prefer to remain kinked. When theTMpotential becomes negative, the voltage sensors move down and do work on the S6 helices, straightening them, and closing the pore. Upon depolarisation, the voltage sensors move back up and the S6 helices therefore spring open and relieve the frustration (strain). Hence the opening and closing mechanisms of Kv channels are different. Furthermore, we show that for the pore to close, the S6 helices do not need to become straight and the S4 helices must only move 4.0–5.2 \AA along the membrane normal. Since proteins are, in general, thought to be minimally frustrated5 Kv channels may be an exception to this rule.},
