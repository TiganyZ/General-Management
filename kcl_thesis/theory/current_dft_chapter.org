** Introduction

 To accurately model the behaviour of an assembly of atoms we must use quantum mechanics. The
 wavelength of electrons, as described by de Broglie $\lambda = \hslash/p$, is of comparable length
 to the atomic spacing in solids. The first postulate of quantum mechanics states that a quantum
 mechanical system can be described by a wavefunction, a function of the positions of the quantum
 mechanical entities, and time, which satisfies the Schr\:odinger wave equation. As such we know that
 the state of the system can be fully described by a /many body wavefunction/: a wavefunction which
 is a function of the positions of each of the electrons and nuclei in the system, which also depends
 on time.

 Assuming that we have non-relativistic electrons, the Schr\:odinger equation one must solve is then

 #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
     \Big( \sum_{i} - \frac{1}{2} \nabla_{i}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_i \sum_j    \frac{1}{|
 \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j |}+ \sum_i \sum_I \frac{-Z_I}{| \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{R}_I |} \Big)
 \mathbf{ \Psi }(\{\mathbf{r}\}; t) = E \mathbf{ \Psi }(\{\mathbf{r}\}; t),
     \label{eq:non_rel_schodinger}
   \end{equation}
 #+END_EXPORT


 where $\mathbf{ \Psi }(\{\mathbf{r}\}; t)$ is an eigenstate and Hartree units have been used( $e = m = \hslash = 4\pi\epsilon_0 = 1$ ).

 A time-independent observable is the expectation value of a given operator,


  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
 \expval{\hat{O}} = \frac{\expval{\hat{O}}{\mathbf{ \Psi }} }{ \bra{\mathbf{ \Psi}}\ket{\mathbf{ \Psi }} },
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT

 this is an integral over all of the coordinates.

 The electronic density operator is defined as

  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
 \hat{\rho}(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \delta ( \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_{i} )
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT


  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
  \rho(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\expval{\hat{n}(\mathbf{r})}{\mathbf{ \Psi }} }{ \bra{\mathbf{\Psi}}\ket{\mathbf{ \Psi }} }.
  \end{equation}
  #+END_EXPORT


 The total energy is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian:
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
  \begin{align}
   E &= \frac{\expval{\hat{H}}{\mathbf{ \Psi }} }{ \bra{\mathbf{\Psi}}\ket{\mathbf{ \Psi }}}\\
     &= \expval{\hat{T}} + \expval{\hat{V}_{\text{int}}} + \int \text{d}^3 V_{\text{ext}} \rho(\mathbf{r}) + E_{II},
  \label{eq:totalenergy}
  \end{align}
  #+END_EXPORT
 where

  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
  V_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{I} -\frac{eZ_{I}}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{R}_I|} \label{eq:externaleZpotential}$
   \end{equation}
  #+END_EXPORT


 is the external potential due to the coulomb interaction between the electrons and the nuclei---the
 expectation value has been explicitly written as an integral over the local electron density,
 $E_{II}$ is the classical electrostatic nucleus-nucleus interaction energy, $V_{\text{int}}$ is the
 electron-electron interaction energy and $\expval{\hat{T}}$ is the expectation value of the
 electronic kinetic energy.
 
 Stationary points in the total energy correspond to eigenstates of the many-body Hamiltonian. One can
 vary the ratio, or the numerator, in eqref:eq:totalenergy. The latter must be subjected
 to the constraint of orthonormality ($\bra{\mathbf{\Psi}}\ket{\mathbf{ \Psi }} = 1$), which is
 possible with the use of Lagrange multipliers. One finds that upon variation of the bra
 $\bra{\mathbf{\Psi}}$ that the ket must satisfy the time-independent Schr\:odinger equation:

  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
 \hat{H}\ket{\mathbf{\Psi}_m} = E \ket{\mathbf{\Psi}},
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT

 where $\ket{\mathbf{\Psi}_m}$ is an eigenstate.

 Quite often, the state we would most like to find is the lowest energy state (/ground state/) of the
 system, as this is the fundamental state from which other mechanisms return to or start from. This
 necessarily occurs at zero kelvin by the third law of thermodynamics. To find this state for the
 full system, one must minimise the energy with respect to the parameters of the many-body
 wavefunction that satisfies the Schr\:odinger equation and appropriate symmetry constraints
 (e.g. for electrons, $\mathbf{\Psi}$ must be antisymmetric). This quickly leads to an explosion of
 complexity: just describing wavefunction of the 22 electrons present in a single titanium, in a
 coarse 10x10x10 grid, one would need to tabulate $(10^3)^22=10^66$ complex numbers to describe the
 electronic wavefunction at each point in the grid. Clearly, minimising a function of this complexity
 is costly. To make the problem tractable, we must make a few approximations.




*** Born-Oppenheimer Approximation

 The first impose an adiabatic approximation on the time-independent wavefunction, which allows us to separate
 nuclear and electronic motion: this is the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. One must first make the
 assumption that the wavefunction which describes the system is a product state between the nuclear
 and electronic portions of the system.

  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
 \psi(\mathbf{R}, \mathbf{r}) = \Phi(\mathbf{R}) \cdot \psi_{\mathbf{R}}(\mathbf{r}),
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT


 where $\psi_{\mathbf{R}}(\mathbf{r})$ is the electronic wavefunction and $\Phi(\mathbf{R})$ is
 the nuclear portion of the wavefunction.

 Due to the large disparity in mass between an electron and the nucleus of an atom ($M_\text{Nuc} \sim
 2000 m_e$) we can neglect the contribution to the Hamiltonian that comes from the nuclear
 kinetic energy operator acting on the electronic wavefunction.

  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
T_{\text{Nuclear}}(\mathbf{R}) \psi_{\mathbf{R}}(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{I =
 1}^{M} - \frac{1}{2M_{I}} \nabla^{2}_{\mathbf{R}_{I}} \psi_{\mathbf{R}}(\mathbf{r})
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT



  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
T_{\text{Electronic}}(\mathbf{r}) \psi_{\mathbf{R}}(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{i =
 1}^{M} - \frac{1}{2m_{i}} \nabla^{2}_{\mathbf{r}_{i}}
 \psi_{\mathbf{R}}(\mathbf{r})
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT


 This results in the motion of the electrons being instantaneous with regard to the
 motion of the ions in the system: electrons relax into their ground state instantly with
 respect to any configuration of the ions. This results in the total energy being a function of
 only the nuclear coordinates cite:Finnis1997.

 To obtain the total energy, we can solve for the electronic part of the wavefunction and then
 solve for the nuclear wavefunction,

  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
 \Big( T_{\text{Nuclear}} + E_{\mathbf{R}} \Big) \Phi(\mathbf{R}) = E_{\text{Total}} \Phi(\mathbf{R}),
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT


 where $E_{\mathbf{R}}$ contains all of the information of the configuration of the electrons in
 the system.


*** Self-Consistent Mean-Field Theory
   
    A major development on the path to tractable calculations is that of Hartree and Hartree-Fock
    theory. A ansatz is made for the many-electron wavefunction, whereby we assume it is a product
    state between single particle orbitals:

     #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
 \Psi_{}(\{\mathbf{r}\}) = \phi(\mathbf{r}_1)\phi(\mathbf{r}_2)\ldots \phi(\mathbf{r}_n).
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT

   
    Applying the variational principle to find the ground state,

     #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
 \frac{ \expval{ \hat{H} }{ \Psi }}{ \bra{\Psi}\ket{\Psi} } = 0
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT


    we obtain the Hartree equations.

*** Density Functional Theory

**** Theory

 Now that the electronic motion has been decoupled from that of the nucleus, we can now try to
 find the ground-state solution for a given configuration of ions. A computationally tractable
 way of doing this for a many-body solid describing all of the electrons is via the /Density
 Functional Theory/.

 Hohenburg and Kohn's seminal paper in 1964 proved that there exists an energy functional of the
 electron density which can provide the exact ground-state energy and density upon
 minimisation. This reduces the number of variables from $3N$ to that of only 3 for any number
 of electrons $N$ in the system of interest.

 In 1965, Kohn and Sham then developed a formalism to practically calculate this ground-state density via
 a set of self-consistent equations: the Kohn-Sham equations.

 The main tenet of Density Functional Theory is: given a system that consists of $N$ electrons,
 there exists an energy functional of the local electron density $E[\rho(\mathbf{r})]$, which
 corresponds to an antisymmetric wavefunction $\ket{\Psi}$; upon minimisiation by
 variation of the electron density, subject to the constraint that the number of electrons is
 conserved,  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
 \int_{\text{all space}} \rho(\mathbf{r}) = N,
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT
 the resulting density is unique
 and the value of the functional is the ground-state energy. To obtain this result we can go
 through the following theory.

 Assuming $\rho(\mathbf{r})$ is the exact ground state density, and $\ket{\Psi}$
 is the ground-state, by the variational principle we can write,

  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
 \bra{\Psi} \mathcal{\hat{T}} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_i\sum_j \frac{1}{| \mathbf{r}_i -
 \mathbf{r}_j |}  \ket{\Psi} + \int \rho(\mathbf{r}) V_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{r})
 \text{d}\mathbf{r} \geq E_0.
 \label{eq:dftvarprinciple}
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT


 The state $\bra{\Psi}$ may not be unique. To make it so, one can subject equation ref:eq:dftvarprinciple
 to the constraints that the number of electrons is conserved and that $\rho$ is constant.

 This defines the functional:

  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
 F[\rho] = \underset{\Psi \rightarrow \rho}{\text{min}} \bra{\Psi} \mathcal{\hat{T}} +
 \frac{1}{2} \sum_i\sum_j \frac{1}{| \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j |}  \ket{\Psi} = T[\rho] +
 E_{ee}[\rho],
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT


 where the notation $\Psi \rightarrow \rho$ is to show that the minimisation is with respect to
 all $\Psi$ that can make the density $\rho$.

 One can see the functional with the minimum value as the ground-state energy is then

  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
 E[\rho] = F[\rho] + E_{\text{ext}}[\rho],
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT


  where
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
  E_{\text{ext}}[\rho] = E_{\text{ext}}[\rho(\mathbf{r})] =  \int \rho(\mathbf{r})
 V_{\text{\text{ext}}}(\mathbf{r}),
   \end{equation}
   #+END_EXPORT

 of which its functional derivative is $V_{\text{ext}}$.

 By the Euler-Lagrange equations, one finds that the ground state must satisfy

  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
 \frac{\delta F[\rho]}{\delta \rho(\mathbf{r}) } + V_{\text{ext}}= \mu.
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT


 A functional is an entity that maps a function to a value, similar as how a function maps a
 variable to a value. The Hohenburg-Kohn theorem states that there exists a functional of the
 electron density which has the correct ground state energy upon minimising the energy with respect to
 the electron density cite:hohenburg64_inhomog_electron_gas. Thus all the information of the
 system is contained in the electron density, which reduces the minimisation
 problem fron $4M$ variables to one of just 3 for any number of electrons in the system.

 To actually find this density, one can use the Kohn-Sham equations to find a self-consistent
 solution for the electron density cite:kohn65_self_cons_eq.




 To find the eigenvalues, one can replace the problem of solving a fully-interacting electronic
 system, with a given electronic density, by an auxiliary non-interacting electronic system which has
 the same electronic density. The resulting eigenvalues can be used to find the expectation value of
 the kinetic energy functional, $T_s[\rho(\mathbf{r})]$, which corresponds to the kinetic energy of the
 non-interacting (Kohn-Sham) system.

 The Hohenburg-Kohn-Sham functional can be defined as

  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
 E_{\text{HKS}}[\rho] = T_{\text{s}}[\rho] + E_{\text{H}}[\rho] + E_{\text{xc}}[\rho] + E_{\text{ext}}[\rho] + E_{\text{ZZ}},
  \label{eq:hks_functional}
   \end{equation}
   #+END_EXPORT


 where $T_{\text{s}}[\rho]$ is the kinetic energy of the fictitious non-interacting auxiliary system
 acting in the same effective potential $V_{\text{eff}}[\rho]$. The assumption made here is that the
 ground state density of the non-interacting, auxiliary system is equal to that of the system with
 full electronic interactions.

 This definition of the functional redefines the exchange-correlation functional: the difference
 between the true kinetic energy and that of the non-interacting system is added to it. Such that the
 true exchange-correlation functional has the form of

  #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
   \begin{equation}
 E_{\text{xc}}[\rho] = \Big( \expval{\hat{T}} - T_{\text{s}}[\rho] \Big) + \Big( \expval{\hat{V}_{\text{int}}} - E_{\text{H}}[\rho]\Big)
    \end{equation}
  #+END_EXPORT


 where we can interpret the first term as being the increase in kinetic energy from electronic
 correlation in a fully interacting system, compared to a non-interacting one---correlations cause
 electrons to move to more energetically favourable areas of the potential, thus increasing the
 kinetic energy---and the second term is difference in energy between a system
 with full electron-electron interactions ($\hat{V}_{\text{int}} = \frac{1}{|
 \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}^{'}|}$) , which includes exchange and
 correlation effects, and the standard Hartree energy, which
 represents the energy from purely an electronic density, with no
 exchange-correlation.

 The difference between the true kinetic energy $\Delta T = T - T_{\text{s}}$ is now approximated by
 the exchange-correlation functional $E_{\text{xc}}[\rho]$. This is a reasonable
 approximation. Separating the kinetic energy from the long-range coulomb interactions means that the
 exchange-correlation potential can be approximated by an approximately local functional. Is this due
 the the fact that correlations basically lead to a screening of the coulomb potential?


**** Solving the Kohn-Sham Equations

 The process by which this happens are as follows: one solves the Poisson
 equation for the Hartree potential, given an initial input density which on
 the first iteration is a sum of atom-centred charges, one finds the total
 effective potential for the system which is the sum of the Hartree potential,
 the potential from the nuclei ($V_{\text{ext}}$) and the exchange-correlation
 potential $V_{\text{xc}}$. The Schr\:odinger equation is subsequently solved,
 and a new electron density is found. This density can be put back into the
 Poisson's equation to find the hartree potential and start the cycle
 again. These equations must be solved self-consistently as the electron
 density that one puts into Poisson's equation is the quantity that one solves
 for. Once the input and output densities are within some tolerance of each
 other, then one can say that the $\rho^{\text{out}}(\mathbf{r}) =
 \rho^{\text{exact}}(\mathbf{r})$, and the resulting Kohn-Sham eigenvalues are
 the ground state energies.

 The Kohn-Sham eigenvalues are not strictly correct.

*** From Density Functional Theory to Tight-Binding

    For a solution to the Kohn-Sham equations, one must have a self-consistent
    density: the input density, from which we construct the effective potential
    must be within some defined tolerance of the output density---constructed
    from the eigenvectors found upon diagonalisation of the hamiltonian.

    One can apply perturbation theory to more closely understand the relationship
    between the input and output densities. We can expand the HKS functional,
    equation [[eqref:eq:hks_functional]], to second order in deviations from the
    input density to obtain the second-order HKS functional:

    \begin{align*}
 E_{\text{HKS}}^{(2)}[\rho] = &\sum_{n\text{ occ}} f_n \expval{ \hat{H}^{\text{in}}  }{\psi_n} \\
     &- \int \text{d}\mathbf{r}
             \rho^{\text{in}}(\mathbf{r}) V_{\text{xc}}^{\text{in}}(\mathbf{r})
	+ E_{\text{xc}}[\rho^{\text{in}}]
	- E_{\text{H}}[\rho^{\text{in}}]
	+ E_{\text{ZZ}} \\
     &+ \frac{1}{2} \int \text{d} \mathbf{r} \int \text{d} \mathbf{r}^{'}
    \left\{
       e^2 \frac{\delta \rho(\mathbf{r}) \delta \rho(\mathbf{r}^{'})}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}^{'}|} \\
 &+ \delta \rho(\mathbf{r}) \frac{\delta^2 E_{\text{xc}}}{\delta \rho(\mathbf{r}) \delta \rho(\mathbf{r}^{'})} \delta \rho(\mathbf{r}^{'}) \Bigger\} \label{eq:second_order_hks_functional}
    \end{align*}

    where, $\rho = \rho^{\text{in}} + \delta\rho$.
    The first line represents the energy from the input hamiltonian, the
    second line subracts the exchange-correlation energy from the first term, to
    encapsulate all exchange-correlation effects in the second term on the second line, the third term
    removes the Hartree contribution from the first line, which is a
    double-counting correction term, with the final term on the second line being
    the classical nucleus-nucleus interaction.

    Omitting the final two lines in equation
    [[eqref:eq:second_order_hks_functional]], we obtain the first-order functional, the Harris-Foulkes
    functional, where we remove the need for self-consistency in order to
    find the ground state energy. This is the basis for tight-binding.
