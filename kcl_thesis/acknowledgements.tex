Firstly I'd like to thank my supervisors, Prof. Mark Sansom for being continually helpful throughout this project. Also my other ``nanopore'' supervisors Prof. Hagan Bayley and Dr. Jayne Wallace. \\

To my family and friends, my parents who have always supported throughout my Oxford years. My friend Steph and fellow PhD-er, and also the ``Welshies'' whose ridiculousness has kept me laughing. Hilaritus - you know who you are.  Also Jemma and Min - my fellow Oxford DPhil-ers for the whining.\\

Everyone who has helped me in the SBCB, David "\textbf{Blank Space}" Shorthouse, GB "\textbf{Red}" Morris, \& Jo "\textbf{Fearless}" Lee. Also previous and past members such as Erin, Nat, Phill S, Phil F, Lukas, Greg, Maria, Rouse, Craig, Jerome and Syma for helping me throughout the many years I have been here. \\*

Also to my internet distractions, be they Spotify, BBC Sport \& Netflix for maintaining my sanity. \\*
