* Fitting a titanium tight-binding model
  \label{ch:ti_fitting}
** Introduction (What, how, where, when, why?)
   Fitted canonical d titanium model such that we could have a better
   description of titanium within a tight-binding framework. Empirical
   potential are not accurate enough to describe the intricacies of the
   titanium structure.

** Fitting

   The overlap integrals were chosen to have a simple exponential
   distance dependence, as initially formulated by Ducastelle,
   cite:Ducastelle1970c and Allan cite:Allan1976. This form was
   originally motivated by an approximation to the density of states,
   of which the form was taken to be a Gaussian fitted to the
   second-moment of the distribution cite:Spanjaard1984. Analysis of
   the hybridisation of $d$ states with nearly-free electron states in
   transition metals gives rise to $d$-band resonances, which suggest a
   fifth-degree power law distance dependence of d-orbitals for the
   matrix elements
   cite:Heine1967,Heine1980,Andersen1985,Harrison1989,Pettifor1995. However, it has
   not been shown that a power-law dependence exhibits better
   transerability over a simple exponential dependence
   cite:Skinner1991,Paxton2010. Many power-law models have not
   fared well in predicting data outside of their fitting range
   cite:Paxton1987,Paxton1989,Girshick1998a,Trinkle2006,Ferrari2019a. Furthermore,
   exponentials do not have large first or second derivatives compared
   to power laws when modified by the cutoff function, which
   complicates fitting for elastic properties, and would provide
   erroneous forces
   cite:Pashov2012. Transferability has been consistently
   shown for the iron tight-binding model created by Paxton and
   ElsÃ¤sser cite:Paxton2010, which a more flexible exponential
   dependence. Their model predicts data well outside of their fitting
   range: non-degenerate dislocation core structures found in the bcc
   phase cite:Simpsonb,Simpson2020, phonons and vacancy-formation
   energies. In addition, the Fe-Fe interactions have been shown
   suitable when incorporated with Fe-H/Fe-C interactions, to describe
   of hydrides and carbides cite:Paxton2010,Paxton2013.

   # Canonical band theory cite:Andersen1985,Paxton2009a suggests that the bond integrals are in the
   # ratio
   # \[
   # \label{eq:canonical_band_ratio}
   # dd\sigma:  dd\pi:  dd\delta = -6:4:-1.
   # \]
   # These ratios are only applicable to the fifth-order power law
   # dependence of the bond integrals, as there is no characteristic
   # $d$-orbital radius from which to compare the ratios. It has been
   # shown that non-orthogonal models of titanium, which have been
   # subsequently orthogonalised to a $d$-band only model, have canonical
   # ratios which deviate largely from canonical band theory; in the case
   # of Urban /et al./ the ratio turned out to be $dd\sigma: dd\pi:
   # dd\delta = -4.3 : 3.6 : -1$, in which the ordering of the ratio
   # magnitudes changed cite:Urban2011.

   # To obtain better fitting results, these ratios were allowed to vary
   # from those found from canonical band theory. This is standard
   # practice in other models . Non-orthogonal models
   # of titanium, which have been subsequently orthogonalised to a
   # $d$-band only model, have canonical ratios which deviate largely from
   # canonical band theory; in the case of Urban /et al./ the ratio
   # turned out to be $dd\sigma: dd\pi: dd\delta = -2.7 : 6.4 : -1$,
   # in which the ordering of the ratio magnitudes changed
   # cite:Urban2011. We do not allow the ratios to deviate by more than
   # 20% in our fitting.
   # # WHY??-


   The bond integrals and pair potential ranges were chosen to start
   decaying to zero by a multiplicative polynomial between first and
   second neighbours in the hcp structure, going to zero between the
   second and third-neighbours. It was verified that the cutoffs were
   not close to neighbour shells found in titanium
   polymorphs, such that in future simulations, there would be no large
   and sudden forces arising from the inclusion of extra neighbours
   upon deformation. A multiplicative cutoff type was preferred over
   augmentative as it has been shown mitigate the effect of large
   second-derivatives, which would cause difficulty in replicating
   experimental elastic constants and phonon dispersion
   cite:Pashov2012.

   In fitting, it was found that having only first-neighbour
   interactions, did not give desirable properties for the hcp phase:
   elastic constants which resulted in negative Cauchy pressures and a
   poor description of the energy difference between titanium
   polymorphs. Increasing the range of the interactions to
   second-neighbours resulted in more favourable results.


   The form of the pair potential was chosen to be simple sum of two
   exponentials and a rapidly decaying power law term. The exponentials,
   which have one large positive term, and a smaller negative term,
   contribute the most over the range of interaction, with the power
   law chosen to only increase the repulsion at smaller distances. The
   addition of this power law gave more desirable gamma surface
   energies more reminiscent of DFT. This will be discussed in section
   *SECTION LABEL*. The resultant pair potential was highly repulsive
   at short distances, yet became slightly
   attractive at larger distances. This allowed for one to
   approximately account for attractive effect of $sd$ hybridisation
   in this simple $d$-orbital only model, as done
   in previous exclusively $d$-orbital tight-binding models for
   titanium cite:Girshick1998a. Even though hybridisation is
   not strictly pairwise in character, we did not deem it necessary at
   this time to complicate matters further.

**** Structure
     - What is the form of the bond integrals and why?
       - Bond integrals
       - Pair potential
	 - Lack of embedding term for hybridisation, why?
	 - Perhaps use Pettifor's argument for the addition of the
           attractive term in the pair potential as an argument for
           hybridisation?
	 - This does not work for the form of the sd titanium model.
     - What is the fitting data?
       - Is this good data to use?
       - What is the motivation?
     - What algorithm was used to fit and why?



**** General Notes
   
     - The exponential bond integral comes from the density of states
       being assumed to be
     - Could the parameterisation be enhanced by environmentally-dependent
     bond integrals?

** sd fitting: Including hybridisation

   We included s orbitals such that one could more readily model the
   Ti$^{4+}$ oxidation state of the Ti ion, which would give a more
   physical representation of titanium ions in quantum electrochemistry
   calculations.
