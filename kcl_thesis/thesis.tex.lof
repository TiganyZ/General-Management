"E", "H" and "S" correspond to easy, hard and split core positions respectively, with the latter also corresponding to atomic positions. The relative energies between the different core positions is smaller in tight-binding compared to DFT. The split core as seen in tight-binding is reminiscent of EAM potentials, where the split core energy is lower than that of the hard core. The discrepancy is probably due to an insufficient repulsion at close range within the tight-binding model.}}{46}{figure.5}%

One can see in $s\text {-}d$ tight-binding model pathway is similar in shape to the EAM potential of Mendelev \cite {Mendelev2003}: it decreases consistently from the hard core to the split core.

C-C interactions were taken into account with the repulsive first-neighbour interaction energy $V_{\text {CC}}=0.30$ eV. No intersite interactions were taken into account. The maximum concentration of carbon around the easy core, drops off at a lower temperature than that of the hard core due to lower binding energy of the E$2$ site compared to the H1 site.
