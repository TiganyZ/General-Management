*** Actions
    - Distributed dSE ARCHER 2 call.
    - Compile all Ti results.
    - Embedding calculations
    - Oxygen vacancy binding
    - Dissolution energies in the octahedral and tetrahedral sites.

*** Notes
    - Mention the muted effect of carbon due to the longer range
      lorentzian.
    - Gladman
    - Binding energy of carbon with strain
    - Continuing with implementation of the line-tension model with
      the concentration dependence as in Ivo's paper

*** Actions
    - No group meeting
    - Follow up Ivo about his notes and how he defines the trap
      sites in the McClean Isotherm model.
*** Notes
    - Talk about the lorentzian of carbon having a reduced effect
      compared to that of hydrogen
    - Talk about the distance dependence of the self-consistent
      McClean isotherm.
