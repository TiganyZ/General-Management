** <2021-02-08 Mon>

   - dislocatiom modelling good
   - carbon is very important,
   - no single vacancies
   - core reconstruction


** <2021-02-01 Mon>

*** Actions

*** Notes
    - How are Ivo's enthalpies so low?
    - What would be his occupancies?
    - Check that my impkementation is correct for the
      Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics.
    - Feugas thinks jerky flow of oxygen dislocations is from oxygen
      content.
    - But Clouet etc things jerky flow from core transition from
      pyramidal to prismatic.
    - But have error limits
    - Set up TB based theory to investigate.
    - Classical potentials dont work
    - Can we use TB to rationalise this

** <2021-01-25 Mon>
*** Actions
    - Distributed dSE ARCHER 2 call.
    - Compile all Ti results.
    - Embedding calculations
    - Oxygen vacancy binding
    - Dissolution energies in the octahedral and tetrahedral sites.
      - Maybe use an experimental reference?
    - Perhaps DFT
** <2021-01-18 Mon>
*** Actions
    - None
*** Notes
    - Mention the muted effect of carbon due to the longer range
      lorentzian.
    - Gladman
    - Binding energy of carbon with strain
    - Continuing with implementation of the line-tension model with
      the concentration dependence as in Ivo's paper

** <2021-01-11 Mon>
*** Actions
    - None
*** Notes
    - No meeting
    - Continuing with implementation of the line-tension model with
      the concentration dependence as in Ivo's paper

** <2021-01-13 Wed>

*** Actions
    - No group meeting
    - Follow up Ivo about his notes and how he defines the trap
      sites in the McClean Isotherm model.
*** Notes
    - Talk about the lorentzian of carbon having a reduced effect
      compared to that of hydrogen
    - Talk about the distance dependence of the self-consistent
      McClean isotherm.
