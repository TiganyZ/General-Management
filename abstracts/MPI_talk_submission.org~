  Martensitic bearing steels have been shown to undergo subsurface microstructural decay, forming Dark Etching
  Regions (DERs), promoting failure through rolling contact fatigue (RCF). Dislocation-assisted carbon
  migration is thought to be the underlying mechanism, yet empirical studies have been inconclusive as to how
  dislocations move carbon and where excess carbon from the martensitic matrix migrates to upon transformation
  to ferrite---a phase of significantly lower carbon solubility. In this talk, we detail the first stages of a
  multi-scale modelling approach to elucidate carbon transport by dislocations. Tight-binding simulations of
  carbon interactions with the $1/2\langle 111 \rangle$ screw dislocation found solute distribution to vary
  significantly within ~2b of the easy and hard cores; the highest binding energy being found in the centre of
  the hard screw core---which is the ground state carbon-dislocation configuration---in agreement with Density
  Functional Theory (DFT). Determination of equilibrium carbon concentration along dislocation lines, at
  various dislocation densities and nominal carbon concentrations, found most sites around the hard core to be
  saturated, with all easy cores reconstructing to hard due to saturation of adjacent octahedral sites. In the
  typical temperature range of bearing operation, we expect all dislocations to be of hard core type, pinned
  by carbon in a prismatic site within the dislocation core. A line tension model of a dislocation was built
  from tight-binding results. Kink-pair formation energies were found to decrease with both carbon content and
  stress. We expect large drag forces acting on dislocations in the initial stages of glide due to
  carbon-dislocation binding. These results provide the basis for the last stage in this multi-scale approach:
  a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation incorporating solute diffusion. From these results we can ascertain
  how carbon moves with dislocations in different stress, temperature and concentration regimes.
