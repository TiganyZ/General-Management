Martensitic bearing steels undergo subsurface microstructural decay, forming Dark Etching Regions, which promote failure through rolling contact fatigue. Dislocation-assisted carbon migration is thought to be the underlying mechanism, yet empirical studies have been inconclusive as to how dislocations move carbon and where excess carbon from martensite migrates to upon transformation to ferrite. We detail a multi-scale modelling approach to elucidate carbon transport by dislocations. Quantum-mechanical tight-binding simulations found that carbon stabilises the 1/2<111> hard screw dislocation core---in agreement with ab-initio calculations. Equilibrium carbon concentrations, estimated from solute-dislocation interaction energies, suggest all dislocations are pinned in this hard-core configuration, in typical conditions. A dislocation line tension model found kink-pair formation enthalpies to decrease with both carbon content and stress. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations incorporating solute diffusion will complete the multi-scale description, showing potential mechanisms for dislocation-assisted carbon migration.

  Regions, which promote failure through rolling contact fatigue. Dislocation-assisted carbon
  migration is thought to be the underlying mechanism, yet empirical studies have been inconclusive as to how
  dislocations move carbon and where excess carbon from martensite migrates to upon transformation
  to ferrite. We detail a multi-scale modelling approach to elucidate carbon transport by
  dislocations. Tight-binding simulations found the ground state carbon-$1/2\langle 111 \rangle$ screw
  dislocation configuration as hard-core with a carbon in a prismatic site---in agreement with ab-initio
  calculations. Equilibrium carbon-concentration calculations suggest all dislocations are pinned in this
  ground-state configuration in typical operating conditions. A dislocation line
  tension model found kink-pair formation enthalpies to decrease with both carbon content and stress. Kinetic
  Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations incorporating solute diffusion will complete the multi-scale description.


  Martensitic bearing steels have been shown to undergo subsurface microstructural decay, forming Dark Etching
  Regions (DERs), promoting failure through rolling contact fatigue (RCF). Dislocation-assisted carbon
  migration is thought to be the underlying mechanism, yet empirical studies have been inconclusive as to how
  dislocations move carbon and where excess carbon from the martensitic matrix migrates to upon transformation
  to ferrite---a phase of significantly lower carbon solubility. In this talk, we detail the first stages of a
  multi-scale modelling approach to elucidate carbon transport by dislocations. Tight-binding simulations of
  carbon interactions with the $1/2\langle 111 \rangle$ screw dislocation found solute distribution to vary
  significantly within ~2b of the easy and hard cores; the highest binding energy being found in the centre of
  the hard screw core---which is the ground state carbon-dislocation configuration---in agreement with Density
  Functional Theory (DFT). Determination of equilibrium carbon concentration along dislocation lines, at
  various dislocation densities and nominal carbon concentrations, found most sites around the hard core to be
  saturated, with all easy cores reconstructing to hard due to saturation of adjacent octahedral sites. In the
  typical temperature range of bearing operation, we expect all dislocations to be of hard core type, pinned
  by carbon in a prismatic site within the dislocation core. A line tension model of a dislocation was built
  from tight-binding results. Kink-pair formation enthalpies were found to decrease with both carbon content and
  stress. These results provide the basis for the last stage in this multi-scale approach:
  a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation incorporating solute diffusion. From these results we can ascertain
  how carbon moves with dislocations in different stress, temperature and concentration regimes.
