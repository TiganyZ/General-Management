** Solution energies

  There are a number of authors who have investigated H/O solutes in
  Î±-Ti.

  For C, N and O, there was an analysis of the solution energies and
  grain-boundary segregation energies for multiple different grain
  boundaries cite:Aksyonov2013,Aksyonov2016.

  The reference energy they use in this case is that of the O_2
  molecule,

  The solution energies of oxygen they obtain are $-5.6 \text{ eV/atom}$, which is in agreement with
  experimental data from $-5.77 \text{ to }  -6.5 \text{
  eV/atom}$ cite:Boureau1976,Tetot1978. VASP calculations by Boureau
  get $-5.75 \text{ eV/atom}$ which also agree cite:Boureau2008.

  In these calculations, Pulay stresses were eliminated by relaxation
  of lattice constants for each of the cell sizes, which was done
  using fitting a polynomial to the 2-D variation of the energy with
  the a and c lattice parameters cite:Francis1990.

  | Cell     | E solution | delta V |
  |----------+------------+---------|
  | Ti_200 O | -5.592 eV  |     3.7 |

  From Nayak /et al./ cite:Nayak2018, they found solution energies for
  oxygen in DFT as follows:

  #+CAPTION: Octahedral and tetrahedral solution energies from \cite{Nayak2018}.
  | Site | E solution [eV] |
  |------+-----------------|
  | O    |           -5.54 |
  | T    |           -4.37 |


  Liang also studied oxygen and hydrogen in titanium cite:Liang. The
  references which he used were $E(\text{H}_2) = 2.233 \text{ eV}$ and
  $E(\text{O}_2) = -9.855 \text{ eV}$, with a final solution energy of
  -5.582 eV/atom.

  Connetable cite:Connetable2011, finds that there is a differrence
  between the insertion energy and the solution energy.

  As for the insertion energy, we find the results

  #+CAPTION: Hydrogen solution eand insertion energies from \cite{Connetable2011}. The remainder from the subtraction of the insertion energy should be half of the bond dissociation energy, which is consistent with what we see.
  | Type | E Insertion [eV, hydrogen] | E Solution | E Solution - E Insertion |

  | Tet  |                      -2.65 |      -0.37 |                     2.28 |

  For tight-binding we just need the binding energy of the molecules,
  as we always, when calculating total energies, have the /cohesive/
  energy, by subtracting the reference energy of the on-site levels
  from the final energy.



  In a comment made in cite:Lozovoi2014e, they do not use absolute
  formation energies, they give them relative to a formation energy of
  an oxygen vacancy, $E^{\text{f}}(\text{V}_{\text{O} })$ at the
  rutile surface, as there is not a reliable energy of the
  $\text{O}_2$ molecule in the non-spin polarized TB model. To
  calculate the formation energy within tight-binding, one has to
  account for the /promotion/ energy of preparing the oxygen atom for
  bonding in the solid from the actual gas phase as well as the
  dissociation energy of the molecule. One finds the dissociation
  energy as $E^{\text{dis}}[\text{O}_2] = 5.23$ eV  In the true gas
  phase, one finds that oxygen has a triplet state, and from doing a
  coupled cluster calculation, one can find the difference in energy
  in going from the triplet state to the singlet state to prepare for
  bonding, 2.399 eV cite:Lozovoi2014e.

  So in the case for the chemical potential in the paxton paper, I
  assume they found that the energy to add an oxygen atom to the
  lattice was \[ \mu_{\text{O}} = E^{\text{prom}}[S^1 \rightarrow
  S^0] + 1/2 E^{\text{dis}}[\text{O}_2] \]

  Going from an oxygen atom dissolved in the bulk, we have the
  following energies to remove it: take the atom to the surface,
  remove atoms from surface, join to oxygen molecule.

 \[ E^{\text{dis} } = - ( E[\text{take O out} ] + E[\text{remove from
  surface} ] - 1/2E[\text{promotion singlet -> triplet} ] -
  1/2E[\text{O_2 dissociation}] ) \]


  \[  \]
  # The atomisation

  # # From NIST 1970

  # E_ox_diss = 498 #3.95 # kJ/mol
  # E_ox = - E_ox_diss * 1.0364 / 100. / 2





  One can make the link between the insertion and dissolution energies:

  \[ E_{\text{ins}} = E[\text{Ti}_x \text{O}] - E[\text{Ti}_x] - E[O]
  \]
  where in this case we have
  \[ E_{\text{dis} } = E_{\text{ins} } - \frac{1}{2} E_{\text{atomization}}[\text{O}_2] \]
  where the atomization energy is the energy necessary to separate the
  atoms infinitely.


  In the paper of Paxton cite:Paxton2010, they use half of the binding
  energy of the $\text{H}_2$ molecule.

  In calculation for the binding energy of the O2 molecule, Bloechl
  cite:Blochl2000, including the zero-point vibrational energy is
  5.912 eV. The experimental value is 5.116eV
  cite:Bokstein2005,Blochl2000. One can also look as the experimental
  dissociation energy of the O2 molecule, which we find as cite:Darwent1970

  Now we can calculate the solution energies, with the tight-binding
  model.

  | DFT [GGA w/ ZPE]  cite:Blochl2000   |                   -2.956 |

  We do the calculations in [[file:~/Documents/ti/final_model_2019-11-06/vacancy_complexes/volume_relaxation/results/2020-05-11_c_relax_kcl/obtain_final_solution_energies.py][obtain_final_solution_energies.py]]

  The solution energies one obtains from the above file are much
  larger than what one expects from DFT.

  It seems that upon inserting oxygen, there are large energy
  differences.

*** Note on the reference energy of an O_2 molecule in DFT

    It has been found that DFT is rather bad at describing molecular
    oxygen cite:Droghetti2008. As we know from Hund's rule, there are two unpaired
    electrons in the bondong orbitals of oxygen, whihc creates a
    triplet ground state which is paramagnetic.


    The basis for the bad description is that there is a
    self-interaction error which is apparent in DFT calculations.

*** Table of solution energies obtained from  [[file:~/Documents/ti/final_model_2019-11-06/vacancy_complexes/volume_relaxation/results/2020-05-11_c_relax_kcl/obtain_final_solution_energies.py][obtain_final_solution_energies.py]]

    The difference is large, in terms of solution energies.

    Inserting oxygen into a perfect lattice and relaxing results in an
    energy difference of -26.4680 eV. This is perhaps because the
    calculations were not self-consistent: charges will simply be
    allowed to move wherever they want.	Perhaps repeat with
    self-consistency including for the volume relaxation. Of course
    repeat for the perfect lattice.



** Diffusion
  There is a thesis by Lucia Scotti has proabably done the most
  comprehensive work, of C, N and O interstitials, including analysis of diffusion coefficients, cite:Scottia,Scotti2016 which builds upon the
  work of Wu and Trinkle cite:Wu2011a.

  Wu and Trinkle only used one intermediate image for the NEB
  calculations such that they could calculate the jump rate and hence
  the diffusion coefficient, whereas Scotti used 3 intermediate
  images. Scotti verified that the MSD (multi-state diffusion) method,
  developed by Landman and Schlesinger cite:Slutsky1957 and KMC are
  viable methods to find the diffusion coefficients.
