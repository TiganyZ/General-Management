\begin{abstract}

We investigate the validity of a dislocation-assisted carbon migration
mechanism underpinning the formation of dark etching regions in
bearing steels undergoing high-cycle fatigue through use of a
multi-scale approach: from quantum mechanics,
to stochastic simulations. We start from tight binding simulations of
$1/3\langle 111 \rangle$ screw dislocations to obtain the 2-d Peierls
potential and Fe-C binding energies. These become ingredients for a line-tension
model of the $1/3\langle 111 \rangle$ screw dislocation to obtain the kink-pair formation
energy as a function of stress and carbon concentration. Finally,
3-d kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations of dislocations in an environment
of carbon are used to ascertain which temperature and stress regimes
dislocation-assisted carbon migration is a valid mechanism.

** Peierls Potential
   
   To determine the Peierls potential, we followed the procedure detailed in Itakura
   cite:Itakura2012. Quadrupolar arrays of dislocations were constructed by placing dislocations of
   antiparallel $1/2\langle 111\rangle$ Burgers vectors in an "S" arrangement cite:Clouet2012, with
   initial displacements determined by the anisotropic elasticity solutions. These displacements
   were modified to be periodic, thereby removing artificial stacking faults which would appear
   between periodic images after the introduction of the dipole. This was achieved by the subraction
   of a linear error term from the superposition of displacement fields arising from the
   dislocations in the simulation cell and its periodic images cite:vasilybulatov2006. To accomodate
   for the internal stress upon introduction of the dislocation dipole into a simulation cell, an
   elastic strain was imposed on the cell, resulting in an extra tilt component being added to the
   cell vectors cite:Clouet2012,vasilybulatov2006. Simulation cells were constructed with different
   initial core positions, which were sampled from the triangular region "EHS" (easy, hard and
   split) core positions, as detailed in ref:fig:peierlspot. To fix the dislocation positions during
   relaxation, the three atoms surrounding the easy core, for each dislocation, were fixed during
   relaxation. 

   The interaction energy between the dislocation dipole and periodic images
   followed the prescription of Bulatov and Cai cite:vasilybulatov2006. In
   isotropic elasticity, the elastic energy of a single dislocation dipole in an
   infinite lattice is given by
   
   
   \[ E_{\text{el}}^{\inf} = \frac{\mu b^2}{4\pi} ln( \frac{r}{r_{c}} )  \]

   The contribution from periodic images to the correction is 

   \[ E_{\text{img} } = E_{\text{el}} (\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{c}_i , r_c) - E_{\text{el}}^{\inf}
   (\mathbf{a}, r_c)\], 

   where 

   \[ E_{\text{img} = \sum_{\mathbf{R}}' E_{\text{dd}} (\mathbf{R}), \]
   
   where $\mathbf{R}$ is a sum over dislocation dipoles in the periodic images
   exclusively. 

   \[ E_{\text{dd}} (\mathbf{R}) = \frac{\mu b^2}{2\pi}
   \text{ln}\frac{|\mathbf{R}|^2}{|\mathbf{R}+\mathbf{a}|\cdot|\mathbf{R}-\\mathbf{a}|}
   \]

   "Ghost" dipoles are introduced to account for the conditional convergence
   of the sum at $\pm\alpha \mathbf{b}$ and $\pm \beta\mathbf{b}$, where $\alpha = \beta = 0.5$.  


   As dislocations were kept at the same distance for each
   calculation, the difference in interaction energies, with dipole correction, was negligible. 



   # The interaction energy was estimated using 
   #  \[  \frac{\mu b^3}{2\pi} \big( -\text{log}(r_{12}) \sum_{i = 1,2}\sum_j q_i
   #  q_j \text{log}(r_{ij})  \big) \]

	Comparison of 2d Peierls potentials of the $1/2\langle 111 \rangle$ screw dislocation between
	DFT can by found in cite:Itakura2012. Data was interpolated using 2d cubic splines. "E", "H"
	and "S" correspond to easy, hard and split core positions respectively, with the latter also
	corresponding to atomic positions. The relative energies between the different core
	positions is smaller in tight-binding compared to DFT; most notably, the energies. This is
	an artifact in the model, which has been validated in NEB calculations of the $1/2\langle
	111\rangle$ screw dislocation Peierls barrier, as calculated with NEB, is roughly half that
	when compared to DFT *INSERT LUKES THESIS REFERENCE*. The split core as seen in
	tight-binding is reminiscent of EAM potentials, where the split core energy is lower than
	that of the hard core.

	This may be attributed to lack of core electron	repulsion, resulting from the sd-iron tight-binding model.

** Hard and easy core relaxations

   To determine the binding energy of carbon to dislocations, we used the
   cluster method; where the simulation cells consist of a circular cluster of
   atoms, split into two regions, with a single dislocation introduced into the
   centre by using the anisotropic elasticity solutions. Each of the clusters
   were centred on the easy or hard core positions. The cluster of atoms was
   split into two regions: a central region of dynamic atoms with radius $R_1$,
   and an annulus of atoms, between $R_1$ and $R_2$, which were fixed to the anisotropic
   elasticity solutions. 

   Initially, large cells of with $R_1 = 6\sqrt{2}a_{\text{bcc}}$, and $R_2 =
   7\sqrt{2}a_{\text{bcc}}$ and depth of single burger's vector, were relaxed
   for both the easy and hard cores, which consisted of 522 and 540 atoms
   respectively. The three atoms surrounding the core were constrained, to only
   relax in $X-Y$ plane, to stop the core from moving upon relaxation. The
   k-point sampling mesh for each of these cells was 1x1x24, with a charge
   tolerance for self-consistency of $1e-6$. Atoms were relaxed until the force
   on each atom was less than $1e-3$ eV/\AA.  

   From the relaxed cells, a smaller region of 174 atoms, with $R_1 =
   3\sqrt{2}a_{\text{bcc}}$, and $R_2 = 4\sqrt{2}a_{\text{bcc}}$, was cut from
   the dynamic regions. This smaller cell was extended to a thickness of 3b in
   the Z direction. Carbon interstitials were inserted into octahedral sites
   near the dislocation core, in the middle layer. Exploiting reflection and
   rotational symmetry, allows us to use only 10 interstitial
   sites to obtain the binding energies of carbon $\sim 1.8$ b from the core. 

   The three atoms surrounding the core on the first and third layers were again
   constrained to relax only in the $X$ and $Y$ directions. No such constraints
   were imposed on the middle layer. 


   As found in DFT simulations by Ventelon cite:Ventelon2015, when a carbon was placed in the
   vicinity of a relaxed easy dislocation core---in either of the two nearest, distinguishable,
   octahedral sites---a spontaneous reconstruction of the dislocation core occurred: from easy to
   hard. Upon reconstruction, the dislocation core moved to a neighbouring triangle, when looking along the $\langle
   111\rangle$ direction, where the carbon found itself situated in the centre.

    Following the paper by Itakura
    cite:itakura13_effec_hydrog_atoms_screw_disloc we calculated the
    binding energy of carbon each of the screw dislocation cores. 

    The solution energy is given by 
    \[ E_s = E_{\text{d + C}} - E_{\text{d}} - E_{\text{C ref.}}, \]
    where $E_{\text{d + C}}$ is the total energy of a relaxed cluster with a
    carbon interstitial and a dislocation, $E_{\text{d}}$ is the total
    energy of a relaxed cluster with a dislocation and $E_{\text{C
    oct.}}$ is the total energy of relaxed a cluster with a single carbon in
    an octahedral site.

    The zero-point energy is calculated as in Itakura. After relaxation of the
    C-dislocation system, a 3x3 Hessian matrix is constructed by taking the
    numerical derivative of forces observed on the carbon atom after
    displacement by $\pm 0.015 \AA$ in each of the $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ directions.
    The three atoms surrounding the core on the first and third layers were
    again fixed in $Z$ coordinate. The zero-point energy is
    given by

    \[ E_z = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{h}{2\pi} \sqrt{ k_i /
    m_{\text{C}} },  \]
    where $k_i$ are the eigenvalues of the Hessian and $m_\text{C}$ is
    the mass of carbon. 

    The ZPE corrected solution energy is given by 
    \[ E^{\text{Z}}_{s} = E_s + \Delta E_z,  \]

    where $\Delta E_z = E_z - E_{z\text{C ref.}}$ and $E_{z\text{C ref.}} = 202.5 meV$ is the zero-point energy of carbon
    situated in an octahedral site in a perfect cluster of the same size.

    # Note how clouet and Itakura did their elasticity calculations, 
    # Perhaps measure the dipole tensor. 
    # Also, do some calculations of edge dislocations and the binding of carbon to those too for the

    # Maybe for elastic calculations of the carbon-dislocation binding energy, one needs to put
    # carbon in cells of varying sizes, and then fit the equation $\sigma_{ij} = 1/V P_{ij} $, where
    # $P_{ij}$, is the elastic dipole tensor cite:Veiga2011.

    # Other papers which have done this are the arXiv papers from Clouet. 
    # Maybe check that the method is the same as the reference that itakura gives for the elastic
    # calculations. 

    # \sigma_{yy} = \sigma{zz} for carbon.
