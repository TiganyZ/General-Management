\begin{abstract}

We investigate the validity of a dislocation-assisted carbon migration
mechanism underpinning the formation of dark etching regions in
bearing steels undergoing high-cycle fatigue through use of a
multi-scale approach: from quantum mechanics,
to stochastic simulations. We start from tight binding simulations of
$1/3\langle 111 \rangle$ screw dislocations to obtain the 2-d Peierls
potential and Fe-C binding energies. These become ingredients for a line-tension
model of the $1/3\langle 111 \rangle$ screw dislocation to obtain the kink-pair formation
energy as a function of stress and carbon concentration. Finally,
3-d kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations of dislocations in an environment
of carbon are used to ascertain which temperature and stress regimes
dislocation-assisted carbon migration is a valid mechanism.

* Introduction

  Martensitic steels are frequently used in bearings due to their resilience to service conditions,
  being subject to high rotational speeds and contact pressures. However, under cyclic loading
  exceeding a given contact stress, the microstructure of the steel can decay due to the accumulation
  of plasticity. This signals the onset of rolling cycle fatigue (RCF), which increases the risk of
  failure from subsurface crack initiation. The microstructural decay corresponds to the observation
  of Dark Etching Regions (DERs) as seen in optical microscopy, where the darkness of these regions is due
  to the higher reactivity of the phases which compose the DER to the etchant; exacerbated by
  the roughness of the DER region.

  Carbon within the martensitic matrix at normal operating temperatures has a low diffusivity; as
  such it cannot segregate out of the martensite. A plausible mechanism for the degradation of the
  martensitic microstructure is a process of carbon migration, driven by dislocation glide,
  described as follows [CITATION]. Due to the high dislocation density exhibited in martensite,
  carbon segregates to dislocations in Cottrell atmospheres, causing pinning. Strain
  generated by cyclic stresses allow dislocations to escape their carbon rich environment. The
  dislocations, now free, re-attract carbon, allowing the Cottrell atmosphere to reform,
  subsequently re-pinning the dislocations, creating a net carbon flux.

  Through dislocation-assisted carbon migration, martensite transforms to ferrite (microband and
  elongated forms). Residual carbides, untouched at the start of DER formation, gradually dissolve
  as a result of highly localised plasticity: dislocation rearrangement and pile ups at the
  interface draw carbon atoms out. Further RCF progression leads to the formation of low and high
  angle ferrite features, White Etching Bands (WEBs), composed from the microband and elongated
  ferrite. Carbon migration through dislocation motion allows carbon to move from the martensitic
  matrix---and (partially) dissolved residual carbides---to form lenticular carbides between these
  ferrite bands. 

  However, fundamentals behind DER formation through this process remain contentious. It is not
  definitively known where carbon migrates to with the onset of DER formation: where does excess
  carbon from the martensitic matrix find itself, when the structure decays to low solubility
  (0.02%) ferrite? It is not known whether carbon atoms inside the martensite are transported
  towards the residual transition carbides, cite:fu17_strain_induc_marten_decay_bearin, or if they
  segregate to the boundaries of ferrite microbands/elongated ferrite.


  Fu /et al./ propose that carbon atoms inside the martensite would segregate to
  pre-existing/residual carbides, increasing their size
  cite:fu17_strain_induc_marten_decay_bearin. This theory has been successfully applied to the
  growth of lenticular carbides cite:Fu2017, however, problems arise with their application to the
  growth of residual carbides: if carbides were to form in martensite, they should follow the
  Bagaryatskii/Isaichev orientation relationship, but observations suggest a lack of any orientation
  relationship cite:Bhadeshia2018. Carbides formed within the DER region have an irregular
  shape/diffuse boundaries, which are seemingly due to the incomplete /dissolution/ of /residual/
  carbides, which is at odds with the theory of Fu /et al./ and residual carbide growth.


  # The appearance of WEBs are correlated with lenticular carbide
  # formation; the observed thickness of the lenticular carbides suggest that carbon is ejected from
  # the WEBs, composed of elongated and nanocrystalline ferrite---the latter being form of ferrite produced later DER
  # formation, which generally has a higher carbon solubility than the forms of ferrite
  # aforementioned. 
  
  # [EXPAND ON THEORIES AND MECHANISMS]



  # As RCF continues, ferrite microbands decay to nanocrystalline ferrite. At the later stages of RCF,
  # there is a reduction in dislocation density within the grain boundaries of nanocrystalline
  # ferrite, which reduces the solubility of carbon, causing the formation of lenticular carbides
  # around the ferrite bands. 

  # Smelova proposes that the formation of ferrite phases are the
  # result of recrystallisation processes, which also bring doubt upon the work of Fu /et
  # al./.



  Probing the fundamental mechanisms behind DER formation experimentally have proven difficult and
  inconclusive. Work needs to be done to understand dislocation-carbon interactions, more specifically, how
  dislocations can move carbon within the temperature and stress regimes experienced during
  operation, and what phenomena occur during dislocation-assisted carbon migration. This is vital to
  understanding martensite decay and DER formation. With further knowledge of the fundamental
  mechanism behind DER formation, we can surpress dislocation motion in the martensitic
  matrix, mitigating failure by RCF.

  To shed light on the fundamental mechanism underpinning DER
  formation---dislocation-assisted carbon migration---a multi-scale modelling approach can be
  used. Atomistics can provide information of the 2d Peierls energy landscape which dislocations are
  subject to in iron; and how this landscape is modified by the binding of carbon to
  dislocations. This data can be used in a line tension model of a dislocation, to determine the
  kink-pair nucleation energies of dislocations as a function of carbon content and stress. Finally,
  one can use a kinetic Monte Carlo model of dislocation glide, by thermally activated kink-pair
  nucleation, in an environment of carbon. From this last stage of coarse-graining, one can
  determine in which regimes of temperature, stress and carbon concentration, dislocation-assisted
  carbon migration becomes a feasible mechanism behind DER formation, with predictions of
  dislocation velocity and where carbon moves to as dislocations glide. In this report, we will focus
  on the atomistic portion of this project, directed at understanding dislocation-carbon interactions at the
  atomistic scale in bcc iron, which will feed into the line-tension model of dislocation kink-pair formation.

  # With this work as a foundation, one should be able to compare the affinity of carbon to
  # dislocations/grain boundaries: specifically carbides and grain boundaries, clarifying if carbides
  # grow, as in the theory by Fu, or if they dissolve, as some optical data suggests. 




# ** Mechanisms

#    There are many proposed mechanisms for DER formation.

#    Bush proposes that DER formation is governed by an
#    exchange of material between the carbides and the matrix, which is
#    evidenced by the formation of intrusions/extrusions within the
#    microstructure. 

#    Swahn proposes that the transformation mechanisms which lead to the
#    formation of new features in DER are due to the redistribution of
#    carbon present in the initial microstructure, which in solution in
#    the martensite, and due to the dissolution of carbides. 

#    They further detail that initially, stress induced carbon diffusion
#    leads to the diffusion of carbon from the martensitic lattice to
#    the various defects in the material (mainly dislocations). 
#    As plastic deformation accumulates, the movement of dislocations
#    creates carbon rich grain boundary-type interfaces. 

#    It is not certain what role and timescale the dissolution of
#    carbides occurs on. 

#    High operating temperatures are known to accelerate DER formation. 

#    In early stage DER formation, there is a high density of ferrite
#    microbands. Later, regions of homogeneous nanocrystalline ferrite
#    (heavily deformed ferrite) are formed in a cell-like structure.




   
   

* Computational Method 

  # We focus here on atomistic simulations, the first stage in the modelling process of
  # dislocation-driven carbon migration. 

  We use the tight-binding model of Paxton and Els√§tter cite:Paxton2013, which has been
  shown to describe the binding energies of carbon complexes in bcc iron, in good agreement with
  high-quality Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. This model reproduces the
  two screw dislocation core structures---the easy and hard $1/2\langle 111 \rang$ cores---exhibited in bcc
  iron, which are crucial to understanding solute-dislocation interactions in bcc iron. Hydrogen and
  carbon have been shown to reconstruct these cores into the, usually metastable, hard core from
  the easy core cite:Ventelon2015,itakura13_effec_hydrog_atoms_screw_disloc. Computationally cheaper models, which
  do not incorporate quantum mechanics, such as the EAM, cannot reproduce these behaviours.

  # This model was used to obtain the 2d Peierls potential of a $1/2\langle 111 \rang$ screw dislocation, by
  # simulation of a periodic array of dislocation quadrupoles with the subtraction of interaction
  # energies. Clusters of single dislocations, of both hard and easy cores, were used to determine
  # the binding energy of carbon to the dislocations, and where carbon will be and is preferentially
  # located around each core. 
  
** Peierls Potential
   
   To determine the Peierls potential of a $1/2\langle 111 \rang$ screw dislocation, we followed the procedure detailed in Itakura
   cite:Itakura2012. Quadrupolar arrays of dislocations were constructed by placing dislocations of
   antiparallel $1/2\langle 111\rangle$ Burgers vectors in an "S" arrangement cite:Clouet2012, see
   [[ref:sarrangementclouet]], with initial displacements determined by the anisotropic elasticity
   solutions. These displacements were modified to be periodic, thereby removing artificial stacking
   faults which would appear between periodic images after the introduction of the dislocation
   dipole. This was achieved by the subraction of a linear error term from the superposition of
   displacement fields arising from the dislocations in the simulation cell and its periodic images
   cite:vasilybulatov2006. To accomodate for the internal stress upon introduction of the
   dislocation dipole into a simulation cell, an elastic strain was applied to the cell, resulting
   in an additional tilt component added to the cell vectors
   cite:Clouet2012,vasilybulatov2006. Simulation cells were constructed with different initial core
   positions, which were sampled from the triangular region "EHS" (easy, hard and split) core
   positions, as detailed in ref:sampledpositions. To fix the dislocation positions during relaxation,
   the three atoms surrounding the easy core, for each dislocation, were fixed in Z coordinate
   during relaxation. Relaxations were carried out until forces on each atom were less than $1\times10^{-3 }\text{eV}\AA^{-1}$.

   # Secondly, the interaction energy between the
   # dislocations should not change in the calculation of the Peierls potential. In a
   # quadrupolar cell, each of the dislocations are the same, with an opposite burger's
   # vector. 

   The interaction energy between the dislocation dipole and periodic images was defined differently
   to that of Itakura's. We followed the prescription of Bulatov and Cai cite:vasilybulatov2006 to
   find a regularised interaction energy, which is independent of truncation limit, in contrast to
   the formulas quoted in Itakura's papers cite:Itakura2012. Details can be found in ref:sec:Ainteractionenergy.

   # The interaction energy was estimated using 
   #  \[  \frac{\mu b^3}{2\pi} \big( -\text{log}(r_{12}) \sum_{i = 1,2}\sum_j q_i
   #  q_j \text{log}(r_{ij})  \big) \]


   The Peierls potential here is defined relative to the energy of the easy core configuration. The
   difference in total energies is taken between a relaxed cell, where the dislocation cores are
   displaced, from the periodic easy core reference, with a correction term coming from the
   difference in interaction energies between the displaced state and the easy core, due to the
   difference in dislocation positions. $\Delta$ henceforth refers to quantities relative to the easy
   core configuration, divided by the total number of dislocations in the reference cell. 

   \[ \Delta E_{\text{P}} = \Delta E^{\text{tbe}} - \Delta E_{\text{INT}} \]

   
** Preliminary calculations
   # ======================================================================
   # BINDING OF CARBON TO DISLOCATIONS
   
   To determine the binding energy of carbon to dislocations, we used the
   cluster method: simulation cells consist of a cylindrical cluster of
   atoms, with a single dislocation introduced into the
   centre using displacements from the anisotropic elasticity solutions. Each of the clusters
   were centred on the easy or hard core positions. The cluster of atoms was
   split into two regions: a central region of dynamic atoms with radius $R_1$,
   and an annulus of atoms, between $R_1$ and $R_2$, which were fixed to the anisotropic
   elasticity solutions. 

   To confirm the anisotropic elasticity solutions we were using was correct, we checked the
   displacements against the analytic solutions to the straight screw dislocation, as given in Hirth
   and Lothe cite:anderson2017theory. Furthermore, we verified we obtained the correct energy
   relations in the limit of large cell size. We inserted dislocation into cells of varying radii:
   $R_1 = x\sqrt{2}a_{\text{bcc}}$, and $R_2 = (x+1)\sqrt{2}a_{\text{bcc}}$, where $x = \{2, 3, 4, 5\}$. The
   excess energy of the defected cells was defined as the energy difference of a cell with a
   dislocation inserted, $E_{\text{d}}$, with respect to a perfect cell reference energy of the same
   geometry, \[ E_{\text{excess}} = E_{\text{core}} + E_{\text{elastic}} = E_{\text{d}} - E_{\text{perfect}} ,\]\label{eq:excessenergy}
   where $E_{\text{elastic}} = \mu b^2 / (4\pi)\text{ln}(R_2 / r_c)$ in the case of our simulations.

   Initially, large cells of with $R_1 = 6\sqrt{2}a_{\text{bcc}}$, and $R_2 =
   7\sqrt{2}a_{\text{bcc}}$ and depth of single burger's vector, were relaxed
   for both the easy and hard cores, which consisted of 522 and 540 atoms
   respectively. The three atoms surrounding the core were constrained, to only
   relax in $X-Y$ plane, to stop the core from moving upon relaxation. The
   k-point sampling mesh for each of these cells was 1x1x24, with a charge
   tolerance for self-consistency of $1\times10^{-6}$. Atoms were relaxed until the force
   on each atom was less than $1\times10^{-3}$ eV\AA^{-1}.  

   From the relaxed cells, a smaller region of 174 atoms, with $R_1 =
   3\sqrt{2}a_{\text{bcc}}$, and $R_2 = 4\sqrt{2}a_{\text{bcc}}$, was cut from
   the dynamic regions. This smaller cell was extended to a thickness of 3$b$ in
   the $Z$ direction. Carbon interstitials were inserted into octahedral sites
   near the dislocation core, in the middle layer. Exploiting reflection and
   rotational symmetry, allows us to use only 10 interstitial
   sites to obtain the binding energies of carbon $\sim2$ b from the core. 

   The three atoms surrounding the core in the first and third layers were again
   constrained to relax only in the $X$ and $Y$ directions. No such constraints
   were imposed on the middle layer. 


** Fe-C binding energies
    Following the paper by Itakura
    cite:itakura13_effec_hydrog_atoms_screw_disloc we calculated the
    binding energy of carbon each of the screw dislocation cores. 

    The solution energy is given by 
    \[ E_s = E_{\text{d + C}} + E_{\text{Perfect}}- E_{\text{d}} - E_{\text{C ref.}}, \]
    where $E_{\text{d + C}}$ is the total energy of a relaxed cluster with a
    carbon interstitial and a dislocation, $E_{\text{d}}$ is the total
    energy of a relaxed cluster with a dislocation and $E_{\text{C
    oct.}}$ is the total energy of relaxed a cluster with a single carbon in
    an octahedral site.

    The zero-point energy is calculated as in Itakura. After relaxation of the
    C-dislocation system, a 3x3 Hessian matrix is constructed by taking the
    numerical derivative of forces observed on the carbon atom after
    displacement by $\pm 0.015 \AA$ in each of the $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ directions.
    The three atoms surrounding the core on the first and third layers were
    again fixed in $Z$ coordinate. The zero-point energy is
    given by

    \[ E_z = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{h}{2\pi} \sqrt{ k_i /
    m_{\text{C}} },  \]
    where $k_i$ are the eigenvalues of the Hessian and $m_\text{C}$ is
    the mass of carbon. 

    The ZPE corrected solution energy is given by 
    \[ E^{\text{Z}}_{s} = E_s + \Delta E_z,  \]

    where $\Delta E_z = E_z - E_{z\text{C ref.}}$ and $E_{z\text{C ref.}} = 202.5 meV$ is the zero-point energy of carbon
    situated in an octahedral site in a perfect cluster of the same size. The difference in
    zero-point energy was found to be negligible in comparison to the binding energies, as one would
    expect from an atom much larger than hydrogen. 

** Analysis of carbon concentration along dislocation

    Using the Fe-C binding energies, one can predict the equilibrium carbon concentration of a given carbon
    binding site, assuming carbon atoms around the core are sufficiently spaced such that intersite
    interaction energies are negligible cite:Ventelon2015.

    The fraction is given by 
    \[  \frac{ c_d^{i} }{1 -  c_d^{i} } = \frac{ c_{\text{bulk}}^{} }{1 - c_{\text{bulk}} } \text{exp} \Big( 
    \frac{E_{\text{b}} }{k_{\text{B}}T}  \Big), \]
    \label{eq:cd}

    where $i$ denotes the $i^{\text{th}}$ carbon binding site (with the convention of attraction
    denoting a positive binding energy), with $E_{\text{b}}^{i}$, being the
    corresponding dislocation-solute binding energyand $c_d^{i}$ being the average concentration of that carbon
    site bound to the dislocation. $c_{\text{bulk}}^{}$ is the carbon concentration in the bulk, with
    $c_{\text{nom}}^{}$ the nominal carbon concentration per Fe atom.


    In a given volume $V$, the number of carbon sites along the dislocation cores is $N_d = \rho V/b$,
    with $\rho$ the dislocation density, and the number of octahedral sites is $N_{\text{oct}} =
    6V/a_{\text{bcc}}$. This imposes constraints on the carbon concentrations: $N_{\text{oct}}
    c_{\text{bulk}}^{} + N_d c_d = N_{\text{oct}} c_{\text{nom}}/3$, where the factor of 3 arises from there being
    three octahedral sites per Fe atom in the bcc lattice. Using this relation, equation [[ref:eq:cd]] can be solved
    self-consistently to give the carbon concentration around the core, $c_d$ as a function of
    nominal carbon concentration and temperature. The nominal carbon concentration was taken to be
    the maximum solubility of ferrite in the DER region, 0.02 wt\% $\approx 433$ appm. The dislocation
    density was varied between $1\times10^{12}$, $1\times10^{14}$ and $5\times10^{15}$.

	# Some of this discrepancy can be attributed to the
	# difference in simulation method: the cluster method may inhibit the relaxation of the core
	# more than quadrupolar cells, due to finite size effects.

** Preliminary calculations

   
   To validate the cluster simulation method, the excess energy, defined as the difference in energy
   between a cell with a dislocation, and a perfect reference cell, was plotted as as function of
   $\text{ln}(R/r_c)$, where $R = R_2$ of the cluster and $r_c = b$, is the core radius, as seen in
   figure ref:lnrdep. In elasticity theory, this should give a linear dependence where the gradient
   corresponds to combinations of elastic constants, with the $y$ intercept corresponding to the
   core energy $E_{\text{core}}$. This is well reproduced by our model, except at low $\text{ln}(R/r_c)$
   as expected, where the cell size is not large enough to accommodate for sufficient relaxation of
   the dislocation core, increasing the core energy.
   
   #+NAME: lnrdep
   #+CAPTION: Excess energy of dislocation clusters with differing radii for both the easy and hard core configurations. The prediction from elasticity theory is given by the black, dashed line. Deviation of both cores occur when cell size is small, creating an increase in the core energy, which elasticity theory cannot account for.
   [[file:~/Documents/docs/Management/Images/img_fe_size_dependence_on_log_of_core_radius.png]]
   



   The core energy difference can be estimated by the difference
   between of excess energies between the easy and hard cores in the limit
   that $\text{ln}(\frac{R}{R_0}) \rightarrow 0$. At the smallest
   value, one finds that the core energy difference $\Delta
   E_c^{\text{Easy-Hard}} = 76$ meV/b. This is in agreement with the
   results of Itakura cite:Itakura2012, of 82 meV/b.

** Fe-C binding energies

   

   As found in DFT simulations by Ventelon cite:Ventelon2015, when a carbon was placed in the
   vicinity of a relaxed easy dislocation core---in either of the two nearest, distinguishable,
   octahedral sites---a spontaneous reconstruction of the dislocation core occurred: from easy to
   hard. Upon reconstruction, the dislocation core moved to a neighbouring triangle, when looking along the $\langle
   111\rangle$ direction, where the carbon found itself situated in the centre. This will be called a
   prismatic site, as in Ventelon's paper. This model successfully
   reproduces this behaviour, confirming that both hard and easy dislocation cores must be studied
   to fully understand screw dislocation behaviour in bcc iron. 


   The binding energies, and distribution, of carbon to both the hard and easy cores can be seen in table
   ref:tab:bindingenergies and figures ref:easybindingenergydist and ref:hardbindingenergydist. The
   distribution of carbon strongly depends on the type of core it finds itself situated near. 

   The easy core only significantly modifies the position of the iE1 site, to the E1 site, situated
   in the centre of an adjacent triangle. All other sites are unaffected, so there is a one-to-one
   correspondence between all $\text{iE}x$ and $\text{E}x$ sites. There are carbon basins available
   close to the core, but not inside: a pseudo-prismatic site is not favourable.

   Carbon favours a prismatic site within the hard core (H1), which has the highest
   binding energy of all sites in both cores of 1.29 eV. There are no binding sites apparent in a triangular
   annulus (of width $\sqrt{2}/2 a_{\text{bcc}}$) surrounding the hard core triangle due to the
   destruction/volume reduction of octahedral sites near the hard core. The initial "octahedral"
   sites, iH1 and iH2 decay to the H1 site. Similarly, iH3 and iH4 decay to the H2 site, with iH9
   and iH10 decaying to a H7 site. Relations between each of the sites is given in table
   ref:decayrelations.

   #+NAME: decayrelations
   #+CAPTION: Decay relations between the initial and final sites upon relaxation of carbon intersitials around the hard core. 
   | Initial   | Final |
   |-----------+-------|

   | iH3, iH4  | H2    |
   | iH5       | H3    |

   | iH7       | H5    |
   | iH8       | H6    |

   Note that interactions between carbon atoms around the core are not taken into account here:
   figures ref:easybindingenergydist and ref:hardbindingenergydist are purely diagrammatic and not
   what one expects the true distribution of carbon would be around a screw dislocation. Carbon is strongly
   repulsive at first nearest-neighbour distances, which would modify each of these
   distributions. Further work is necessary to elucidate the equilibrium distribution at different
   carbon concentrations.

    # Values in square brackets denote fully unconstrained relaxation of all degrees of freedom, using quadrupolar dislocation arrays for direct comparison to Ventelon \cite{Ventelon2015}.

    These binding energies agree well with experiment and previous calculations.  Kamber \emph{et
    al.} found a maximum binding energy of 0.5 eV. Cochardt found a value of 0.71 eV, which is
    within 0.1eV of the largest binding energy for the easy core.
    
    EAM calculations by Clouet cite:Clouet2008,Becquart2007 found a maximum binding energy of 0.41 eV by
    calculating the elastic dipole tensor within Eshelby theory. Hanlumyuang /et al./
    cite:Hanlumyuang2010, similarly conducted DFT and EAM calculations for the interaction energy
    12\AA from the core, and their calculations agreed with the continuum limit of Eshelby theory with
    a binding energy of 0.2 eV.

    In work by Ventelon cite:Ventelon2015, the interaction energy of a carbon in a hard
    core prism configuration was found to be 0.79 eV for a thickness in the $Z$ direction of 3$b$ (0.73eV for $6b$)---in the
    convention that a positive binding energy indicates attraction. This is significantly lower than
    the 1.29eV interaction energy of tight-binding. 
    # This discrepancy can be
    # partially explained due to the short cutoff of the carbon interactions in tight-binding---at
    # $\sim a_{\text{bcc}} = 2.87 \AA$. 
    This discrepancy can be partially explained by the fact that the cells have not been allowed to
    relax with all degrees of freedom, as in the Ventelon results: the three atoms around the screw
    core are fixed in Z to fix the dislocation core position. A larger source of error is likely
    to do with the fitting of the tight-binding model itself. The Peierls barrier of this s-d model
    of iron, necessary for Fe-C interactions, has been show to be half that found in DFT, or the
    canonical d model cite:Simpson2019, but the solution energies for Fe-C defect complexes are well
    described. This implies there is insufficient repulsion between Fe-Fe species, upon deformation,
    leading to a higher Fe-C binding energy from tight-binding, compared to DFT.

** Analysis of carbon concentration along dislocation
   
   Variation of carbon concentration along the dislocation line for each of the binding sites can
   be seen in figure ref:cdhardeasy. Due to the easy core binding less strongly to the screw core,
   one sees that the concentration of weakly bound sites occurs at a lower temperature, as
   expected. Dislocation densities near the upper bound of what has been observed in martensite, from $\rho =
   \sim10^{15}$, reduce the temperature at which concentrations of carbon decrease around the dislocation
   core.

** Progression to Line Tension Model 

   From the atomistic calculations of the Peierls potential and carbon-dislocation binding energies, one can make a
   line tension model of a dislocation from which we can obtain the kink-pair formation energies as
   a function of stress and carbon content.  This model views the dislocation as an elastic string
   which moves on the Peierls potential $\Delta E_{\text{P}}$.

   The dislocation is modelled as a discretised line, with layer labels $j$. The energy of a
   dislocation line in the line tension model is given by:

   \[ E_{\text{LT}} = \frac{K}{2} \sum_j (\vec{P}_j - \vec{P}_{j+1} )^2  + \sum_j \Delta E_{\text{P}}  (\vec{P}_j) +
   (\sigma \cdot \vec{b}) \times \vec{l} \cdot \vec{P}_j  - \sum_{j,k} E_{\text{C}} (|\vec{P}_j-\vec{P}_k^{}^{\text{C}}|), \]
   
   where $K$ is a constant calculated from the model, $\Delta E_{\text{P}}$ is the Peierls potential, $\sigma$ is
   the stress applied, $\vec{b}$ is the burger's vector, with the dislocation line sense given by
   $\vec{l}$. $\vec{P_{j}}$ corresponds to the dislocation core position in a given
   layer, with $E_{\text{C}} (|\vec{P}_j-\vec{P}_k^{}^{\text{C}}|)$ being the binding energy of a particular carbon
   $k$, at position $\vec{P}_k^{\text{C}}$, to a dislocation positioned at $\vec{P}_j$. 


   The $K$ coefficient was calculated from atomistic simulations, using the prescription of Itakura cite:Itakura2012,
   calculating a hessian from the displacement of atoms surrounding the dislocation core, giving
   results of $K = 0.734$ eV\AA$^{-2}$, compared to DFT $K = 0.816}$ eV\AA$^{-2}$. 



   #+NAME: lorentzianfit
   #+CAPTION: Fit of lorentzian to carbon-dislocation binding energies. The sites chosen to fit to were determined by those sites a prismatic carbon in a hard core configuration would find itself, if the dislocation were to move without it along the $X = \lang\bar{2}111\rang$ direction.

   The distance dependence of the dislocation-carbon binding energies, as seen in ref:distancedep
   and ref:lorentzianfit,
   can be fit by a single lorentzian, as was done in Itakura---but with the ommision of many binding
   energies, as is done in . To take more of the atomistic data into account in the line tension
   model, we propose another method to be used in further work.

   # Upon movement of a screw dislocation saturated with carbon, for example, the expected hard core
   # ground state configuration (with H$x$ sites filled) to an adjacent easy core position, it is
   # expected that carbon will not diffuse away in the time it takes for the dislocation to move position,
   # due to the large dislocation velocity compared to the speed of diffusivity in carbon. So sites
   # occupied by carbon will remain in the same position relative to the lattice as the dislocation
   # changes to the easy core.  This results in a new dislocation-carbon configuration. If the carbon
   # is near one of the positions of the E$x$ sites, it will decay to that position, resulting in a
   # new carbon-dislocation binding energy, which is now of easy core type. One can linearly
   # interpolate between these binding energies, depending dislocation core position.

   
   # - Show line tension work maybe?
   # - Inconclusive right now as more work needs to be done. 
   # - Explain the interpolation between the easy and hard cores, for where it is possible, otherwise,
   #   fit a lorentzian!


   Validation tests of the solute-dislocation interaction within the line tension model will be carried
   out on the Itakura data set for the binding of hydrogen to screw dislocations in bcc iron. This
   will be used to verify the kink-pair formation enthalpies stated in their paper (using the
   lorentzian form of the dislocation-solute interaction energy). This data set will also be used to
   verify the new interpolated solute-dislocation interaction energy, between
   the hard and easy core configurations.


   # The julia implementation of the NEB/string algorithms was used cite:Makri2019. One
   # finds that the line shapes are similar to that of Itakura. 

   
   
* Discussion
  

  # - How do the results of this work feed into C migration with
  #   dislocations? 
  # - How valid is the theory we have vs Fu /et al/.
  # - Novel work to find out dislocation environment around both dislocation cores.

    

    As in cite:Lthi2019, carbon interactions are found to be vital in understanding how screw
    dislocations move in steels. Due to the spontaneous reconstruction of the easy core upon
    introduction of carbon, and the large binding energy of the H1 site, one would expect a hard
    core with carbon in a prismatic site as the ground state configuration for pinned
    dislocations. With stress, the dislocation will be forced to move (say, along the $X =
    \lang\bar{2}11\rang$ direction), which results in the hard core reconstructing to an easy core. Due to
    the much higher velocity of dislocations, relative to the diffusivity of carbon, one expects
    carbon in the prismatic site will not move, becoming an E1 site. A drag force acting on the
    dislocation now hinders further motion due to the binding of the carbon in the E1
    site relative to the dislocation centre. Progression of dislocation glide results in further
    reconstruction of the dislocation core to hard, easy and hard cores, with the original carbon being situated in H2, E6 and H3
    sites respectively, relative to the dislocation. Thus as the dislocation moves, the drag forces
    on the dislocation decrease.



    This forms the basis of the line tension model of the dislocation. We have a more sophisticated
    method of being able to incorporate the binding energy of carbon to dislocations than Itakura. 

  # - Peierls potential agrees, although it is low compared to DFT
  # - Line tension model has been set up, although results have not been achieved yet.
  # - kMC depends on the results of the line tension model. 

  # The first stage in this work is 
    

  
* Future work  

  - Validation of line-tension model by reproduction of the dislocation line shape from
    Itakura 2012 cite:Itakura2012.
  - Compare tbe dislocation line shape with Itakura, and find the migration path of the dislocation from tbe data.
  - [Optional] Create Ising model for easy and hard core an compare the binding energies like cite:Lthi2019. 
  - [Optional] Find the elastic dipole tensor to check the binding energy of C within anisotropic elasticity.
  - Choose the sites for which one can fit a function (lorentzian) for the interaction energy between C and Fe.
  - Find the kink-pair formation enthalpy, with and without carbon, to feed into the kMC
    code. 


  It would be of interest to pursue atomistic calculations of carbon bound to edge
  dislocations. Recent DFT/Eshelby elasticity calculations by Maugis /et al./ cite:Maugis2020, show,
  counterintuitively, that under /compressive/ stress, carbon diffusivity is /enhanced/. Pipe
  diffusion along edge dislocations could therefore be an important aspect to consider in carbon transport; in
  addition to the higher mobility edge dislocations in bcc iron. As such, edge dislocations could be quite
  important within the mechanism of dislocation-assisted carbon migration.

** Regularisation of interaction energy in quadrupolar array
   \label{sec:Ainteractionenergy}

   
   In isotropic elasticity, the elastic energy of a single dislocation dipole in an
   infinite lattice is given by
   
   
   \[ E_{\text{el}}^{\infty} = \frac{\mu b^2}{4\pi} ln \big( \frac{r}{r_{c}} \big)  \]

   The contribution from periodic images to the correction is 

   \[ E_{\text{img} } = E_{\text{el}} (\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{c}_i , r_c) - E_{\text{el}}^{\infty}
   (\mathbf{a}, r_c),\]

   "Ghost" dipoles are introduced to account for the conditional convergence of the sum at $\pm\alpha
   \mathbf{b}$ and $\pm \beta\mathbf{b}$, where $\alpha = \beta = 0.5$. We define $E_{\text{dg}} (\mathbf{R})$ as the
   interaction energy of a ghost dislocation and a dipole at $\mathbf{R}$ anisotropic elasticity
   equations as shown in cite:Cai2003.
   
   
   Defining, 
    \[ E_{\text{dd}} (\mathbf{R}) = \frac{\mu b^2}{2\pi}
   \text{ln}\frac{|\mathbf{R}|^2}{|\mathbf{R}+\mathbf{a}|\cdot|\mathbf{R}-\mathbf{a}|},
   \]
   we obtain,
   \[ E_{\text{img}} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\mathbf{R}} [ E_{\text{dd}} (\mathbf{R}) - E_{\text{dg}} (\mathbf{R}) ] - \frac{1}{2}_{}
   E_{\text{dg}} (\mathbf{R} = 0),  \]
   
   which can be subtracted from the total energy as given from atomistic calculations, for a
   regularised interaction energy.
