  \begin{abstract}
  Martensitic bearing steels have been shown to undergo subsurface microstructural decay, forming
  Dark Etching Regions (DERs), promoting failure through rolling contact fatigue
  (RCF). Dislocation-assisted carbon migration is thought to be the underlying mechanism, yet
  empirical studies have been inconclusive as to how dislocations move carbon and where excess
  carbon from the martensitic matrix migrates to upon transformation to ferrite---a phase of
  significantly lower carbon solubility. In this report, we detail the first stage of a multi-scale
  modelling approach to elucidate carbon transport by dislocations. Tight-binding simulations of
  carbon interactions with the $1/2\langle 111 \rangle$ screw dislocation found solute distribution to vary
  significantly within $\sim2$b of the easy and hard cores; the highest binding energy being found in
  the centre of the hard screw core---which is the ground state carbon-dislocation
  configuration---in agreement with Density Functional Theory (DFT). Determination of equilibrium
  carbon concentration along dislocation lines, at various dislocation densities and nominal carbon
  concentrations, found most sites around the hard core were saturated, with all easy cores
  reconstructing to hard due to saturation of adjacent octahedral sites. In the typical temperature
  range of bearing operation, we expect all dislocations to be of hard core type, pinned by carbon
  in a prismatic site within the dislocation core. We anticipate large drag forces acting on
  dislocations in the initial stages of glide, due to carbon-dislocation binding. These atomistic
  results provide data for the last two stages in this multi-scale approach: determination
  of kink-pair formation energies as a function of stress and carbon concentration using a line
  tension model of a dislocation, and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations incorporating solute
  diffusion, to ascertain how carbon moves with dislocations in different stress, temperature and
  concentration regimes.

* Introduction

  Martensitic steels are frequently used in bearings due to their resilience to service conditions,
  being subject to high rotational speeds and contact pressures. However, under cyclic loading
  exceeding a given contact stress, the microstructure of the steel can decay due to the accumulation
  of plasticity. This signals the onset of rolling cycle fatigue (RCF), which increases the risk of
  failure from subsurface crack initiation. The microstructural decay corresponds to the observation
  of Dark Etching Regions (DERs) as seen in optical microscopy, where the darkness of these regions is due
  to the higher reactivity of DER phases to the etchant; exacerbated by
  the roughness of the DER region cite:skf2019. See figure ref:fuderpicture.

  Decay of the martensitic microstructure is complex, with observation of many different
  phenomena. Martensite transforms to ferrite microbands as a result of strain localization
  cite:Fu2017,il_micros_alter_rollin_contac_fatig,jonesil_metal_obser_ball_bearin_fatig_phenom,70_micros_microh_resid_stres_chang,Swahn1976,Voskamp1997,voskamp97_state_resid_stres_induc_by,polonsky95_white_etchin_band_format_rollin_bearin,vsmelova17_elect_micros_inves_micros_alter. Residual
  carbides, untouched at the start of DER formation, gradually dissolve within ferrite and
  martensite cite:70_micros_microh_resid_stres_chang,Swahn1976,Osterlund_1980. Further RCF
  progression leads to the formation of low and high angle ferrite features, White Etching Bands
  (WEBs), composed of nanocrystalline cite:Voskamp1997,Osterlund_1980,Mitamura_2007 and elongated
  ferrite cite:vsmelova17_elect_micros_inves_micros_alter. Lenticular carbides precipitate at the
  boundaries of these ferrite bands cite:Swahn1976,Osterlund_1980. Thickening of these carbides
  occurs during DER development and is correlated with WEB growth
  cite:Fu2017,fu17_strain_induc_marten_decay_bearin,Warhadpande1_2013,Warhadpande2013. Reductions in
  dislocation density in nanocrystalline (heavily deformed) ferrite have been observed in the later
  stages of DER formation cite:skf2019,voskamp80_gradual_chang_resid_stres_micros.



  Carbon migration is thought to be the mechanism by which this degradation occurs, but it is not
  definitively known how or where carbon migrates with the onset of DER formation. The key questions
  are: where does excess carbon from the martensitic matrix find itself when the structure decays to
  low solubility (0.02 wt%) ferrite? and how is the carbon transported, given its low diffusivity in
  martensite/DER phases
  cite:hashemi11_stren_hardn_statis_correl_api_x65_steel? 

  
  Fu /et al./ propose that carbon atoms inside the martensite would segregate to
  pre-existing/residual carbides, increasing their size
  cite:fu17_strain_induc_marten_decay_bearin. This theory was successfully applied to the
  growth of lenticular carbides cite:Fu2017, however, problems arise with the application to
  temper carbide growth: if carbides were to form in martensite, they should follow the
  Bagaryatskii/Isaichev orientation relationship, but observations suggest a lack of any orientation
  relationship cite:Bhadeshia2018. Temper carbides residing within DERs have irregular
  shapes/diffuse boundaries, which are seemingly due to the incomplete /dissolution/ of /temper/
  carbides, which is at odds with the theory of Fu /et al./.

  A plausible mechanism for carbon migration is that it is driven by dislocation glide, which is as
  follows
  cite:Fu2017,Swahn1976,voskamp97_state_resid_stres_induc_by,fu17_strain_induc_marten_decay_bearin,Warhadpande1_2013,Warhadpande2013. Due
  to the high dislocation density exhibited in martensite, carbon segregates to dislocations in
  Cottrell atmospheres, causing pinning. Strain generated by cyclic stresses allow dislocations to
  escape their carbon rich environment. The free dislocations re-attract carbon, allowing the
  Cottrell atmospheres to reform, subsequently re-pinning the dislocations, creating a net carbon
  flux.  This mechanism allows for the movement of carbon during the martensite-ferrite transition,
  while also explaining how excess carbon can move from the ferrite phases to lenticular carbides at
  the boundaries, describing the process behind both WEB growth and carbide thickening. Moreover, it
  explains the dissolution of residual carbides, both in ferrite WEBs and martensite, due to
  dislocation rearrangement and pile ups at the carbide interface drawing carbon atoms out, due to a
  more favourable binding to dislocations. However, as to how this process occurs on the atomistic
  scale, or if it is indeed feasible, is unknown.



  Experimentally probing dislocation-assisted carbon migration has proven difficult and inconclusive. Work needs to be done
  to understand dislocation-carbon interactions; more specifically: how dislocations move carbon
  within the temperature and stress regimes experienced during operation; where carbon is
  transported to and what the resultant dislocation networks are. 


  To shed light on this mechanism, a multi-scale modelling approach can be
  used. Atomistics can provide information of the 2d Peierls energy landscape which dislocations are
  subject to in iron; and how this landscape is modified by the binding of carbon to
  dislocations. This data can be used in a line tension model of a dislocation to determine the
  kink-pair formation energies of dislocations as a function of carbon content and stress. Finally,
  one can use a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model of dislocation glide by thermally activated
  kink-pair nucleation, in an environment of carbon. From this last stage of coarse-graining, one
  can determine in which regimes of temperature, stress and carbon concentration,
  dislocation-assisted carbon migration becomes a feasible mechanism behind DER formation, with
  predictions of dislocation velocity, dislocation configurations and where carbon moves with
  dislocation glide. 

  In this report, we will focus on the atomistic portion of this project,
  directed at understanding dislocation-carbon interactions at the atomistic scale in ferrite (bcc
  iron).
  With further knowledge of the fundamental mechanism behind DER formation, we can hope to suppress
  dislocation motion in the martensitic matrix, mitigating failure by RCF.

   

* Computational Method 


  We use the tight-binding model of Paxton and Els√§sser cite:Paxton2013, which has been shown to
  describe the binding energies of carbon complexes in bcc iron, in good agreement with DFT
  calculations. This model reproduces the two screw dislocation core structures---the easy and hard
  $1/2\langle 111 \rangle$ cores---exhibited in bcc iron. Study of both is crucial to understanding
  solute-dislocation interactions. The easy core is the ground state in pure iron, but solutes, such
  as hydrogen and carbon, have been shown to reconstruct this core into the hard core
  configuration cite:Ventelon2015,itakura13_effec_hydrog_atoms_screw_disloc. Computationally cheaper
  models, which do not incorporate quantum mechanics, such as the EAM, cannot reproduce these
  behaviours.

  
** Peierls Potential
   
   To determine the Peierls potential of the $1/2\langle 111 \rangle$ screw dislocation, we followed the
   procedure detailed in Itakura cite:Itakura2012. Quadrupolar arrays of dislocations were
   constructed by placing dislocations of antiparallel $1/2\langle 111\rangle$ Burgers vectors in an "S"
   arrangement cite:Clouet2012, with initial displacements determined by anisotropic elasticity
   solutions. See figure ref:fig:dislocationschematics, left. A quadrupolar arrangement minimises
   the stress each dislocation experiences in the simulation. These displacements were modified to
   be periodic, thereby removing artificial stacking faults which would appear between periodic
   images after introduction of the dislocation dipole. This was achieved by the subtraction of a
   linear error term from the superposition of displacement fields arising from the dislocations in
   the simulation cell and its periodic images cite:vasilybulatov2006. To accommodate for the
   internal stress upon introduction of a dislocation dipole into the simulation cell, an elastic
   strain was applied to the cell, resulting in an additional tilt component to cell vectors
   cite:Clouet2012,vasilybulatov2006. Simulation cells were constructed with different initial core
   positions, which were sampled from the triangular region "EHS" (easy, hard and split) core
   positions, as detailed in figure ref:sampledpositions. To fix the dislocation positions during
   relaxation, the three atoms surrounding the easy core, for each dislocation, were fixed in $Z$
   coordinate during relaxation, where $Z$ is a $\langle 111 \rangle$ direction, along the dislocation line. The
   k-point sampling mesh for each of these cells was 5x5x30.

    \end{figure}


   The interaction energy between the dislocation dipole and periodic images was defined differently
   to Itakura cite:Itakura2012. We followed the prescription of Bulatov and Cai cite:vasilybulatov2006 to
   find a regularised interaction energy, which is independent of truncation limit, in contrast to
   the formulas quoted in Itakura's papers. Details can be found in section ref:sec:Ainteractionenergy.




   The Peierls potential $\Delta E_{\text{P}}^i$, for an isolated dislocation at the $i^{\text{th}}$ core
   position, can be calculated from
   \begin{equation}
    \Delta E_{\text{P}}^i = \Delta E_{\text{tbe}}^{i} - \Delta E_{\text{INT}}^{i} ,\label{eq:peierlspot} 
    \end{equation} 
   where $\Delta$ refers to quantities, per dislocation, relative to the relaxed easy core configuration
   (labelled as E/1, as in figure ref:sampledpositions). /e.g/ $\Delta E_{\text{tbe}}^{i} = \frac{1}{2} (
   E_{\text{tbe}}^{i} - E_{\text{tbe}}^{\text{E}} )$ is the difference in energy, per dislocation, between
   a relaxed cell which has the two dislocation cores placed at position $i$, $E_{\text{tbe}}^{i}$, and a relaxed
   cell which has the two cores placed in easy core positions $E_{\text{tbe}}^{\text{E}}$, divided by the number of
   dislocations in each of the simulation cells. Dislocation-dislocation interaction
   energies are included in this term, due to dislocations in the simulation cell---and
   periodic images---interacting with each other, as can be readily seen in figure
   ref:fig:dislocationschematics. To model the energy landscape of an isolated dislocation, these
   interaction energies must be subracted, which is achieved by the correction term $\Delta E_{\text{INT}}^{i}
   = \frac{1}{2} ( E_{\text{INT}}^{i} - E_{\text{INT}}^{\text{E}} )$.
   
** Preliminary calculations
   # ======================================================================
   # BINDING OF CARBON TO DISLOCATIONS
   
   To determine the binding energy of carbon to dislocations, we used the cluster method, as shown
   in figure ref:fig:dislocationschematics, right. Simulation
   cells consisted of a cylindrical cluster of atoms, with a single dislocation introduced into the
   centre using displacements from anisotropic elasticity solutions. Each of the clusters were
   centred on the easy or hard core positions. The cluster of atoms was split into two regions: a
   central region of dynamic atoms with radius $R_1$, and an annulus of atoms, between $R_1$ and $R_2$,
   which were fixed in position to the displacements from anisotropic elasticity.


   To confirm the anisotropic elasticity solutions were correct, we compared the
   displacements against the analytic solutions to the straight screw dislocation, as given in Hirth
   and Lothe cite:anderson2017theory. Furthermore, energy scaling relations were verified. We
   inserted dislocations into cells of varying radii: $R_1 = x\sqrt{2}a_{\text{bcc}}$, and $R_2 =
   (x+1)\sqrt{2}a_{\text{bcc}}$, where $x \in \{2\dots5\}$. The excess energy
   was defined as the energy difference of a cell with a dislocation inserted, $E_{\text{d}}$, with
   respect to a perfect cell reference energy of the same geometry,
 
   \begin{equation}
    E_{\text{excess}} =   E_{\text{core}} + E_{\text{elastic}} = E_{\text{d}} - E_{\text{perfect}}   ,\label{eq:excessenergy}
    \end{equation} 
   where
   $E_{\text{elastic}} = ( \mu b^2 / 4\pi )\text{ln}(R/ r_c)$, with $R = R_2$ and $r_c = b$.

   Initially, large cells of $R_1 = 6\sqrt{2}a_{\text{bcc}}$, and $R_2 =
   7\sqrt{2}a_{\text{bcc}}$ with depth of single burger's vector, were relaxed
   for both the easy and hard cores, which consisted of 522 and 540 atoms
   respectively. The three atoms surrounding the core were constrained to only
   relax in $X-Y$ plane, to fix the dislocation upon relaxation. 
   The k-point sampling mesh for each of these cells was 1x1x24.

   From the relaxed cells, a smaller region of 174 atoms, with $R_1 = 3\sqrt{2}a_{\text{bcc}}$, and $R_2
   = 4\sqrt{2}a_{\text{bcc}}$, was cut from the dynamic regions. This smaller cell was extended to a
   thickness of 3$b$ in the $Z$ direction. Carbon interstitials were inserted into octahedral sites
   near the dislocation core, in the middle layer. Exploiting reflection and rotational symmetry,
   only 10 interstitial sites needed to be used to obtain the binding energies of carbon $\sim2$ b from
   the core, denoted by iH$j$ and iE$j$, where $j \in \{1\dots10\}$. The final binding sites are denoted
   by H$k$ and E$j$, where $k \in \{1\dots7\}$. The three atoms surrounding the core in the first and
   third layers were again constrained to relax only in the $X$ and $Y$ directions. No such
   constraints were imposed on the middle layer.


** Fe-C binding energies
   We calculated the carbon-dislocation binding energies as in Itakura
    cite:itakura13_effec_hydrog_atoms_screw_disloc.

    The binding energy is given by 
    \begin{equation}  
    E_b = -( E_{\text{d+C}} + E_{\text{perfect}}- E_{\text{d}} - E_{\text{C ref.} } ),    
    \end{equation}

    where $E_{\text{d+C}}$ is the total energy of a relaxed cluster with a
    carbon interstitial and a dislocation, $E_{\text{d}}$ is the total
    energy of a relaxed cluster with a dislocation and $E_{\text{C
    ref.}}$ is the total energy of a relaxed perfect cluster with a single carbon in
    an octahedral site. A positive binding energy indicates favourable binding.

    The zero-point energy (ZPE) is calculated as in Itakura. Details can be found in ref:sec:zeropointenergy. 
    The ZPE corrected binding energy is given by 
    \[ E^{\text{Z}}_{b} = E_b + \Delta E_z,  \]
    where $\Delta E_z = E_z - E_{z}^{\text{C ref.}}$ and $E_{z}^{\text{C ref.}} = 202.5 \text{meV}$ is the zero-point energy of carbon
    situated in an octahedral site in a perfect cluster of the same size. 

** Analysis of carbon concentration along dislocation

    Using the Fe-C binding energies, one can predict the equilibrium carbon concentration of a carbon
    binding site $c_d$, under the assumption that carbon atoms around the core are sufficiently spaced such that intersite
    interaction energies are negligible cite:Ventelon2015.

    The concentration is given by 

    \begin{equation}
    \frac{ c_d^{i} }{1 -  c_d^{i} } = \frac{ c_{\text{bulk}}^{} }{1 - c_{\text{bulk}} } \text{exp} \Big( 
    \frac{E_{\text{b}}^i}{k_{\text{B}}T}  \Big),    \label{eq:cd}
    \end{equation}
    where $i$ denotes the $i^{\text{th}}$ carbon binding site, with $E_{\text{b}}^{i}$, being the
    corresponding dislocation-solute binding energy (in the convention of attraction
    denoting a positive binding energy). $c_d^{i}$ is the average concentration of the $i^{\text{th}}$ carbon
    site bound to the dislocations. $c_{\text{bulk}}^{}$ is the carbon concentration in the bulk, with
    $c_{\text{nom}}^{}$ the nominal carbon concentration per Fe atom.


    In a given volume $V$, the number of carbon sites along the dislocation cores is $N_d = \rho V/b$,
    with $\rho$ the dislocation density, and the number of octahedral sites is $N_{\text{oct}} =
    6V/a_{\text{bcc}}$. This imposes constraints on the carbon concentrations: $N_{\text{oct}}
    c_{\text{bulk}}^{} + N_d c_d = N_{\text{oct}} c_{\text{nom}}/3$, where the factor of 3 is because there are
    three octahedral sites per Fe atom in the bcc lattice. Using this relation, equation ref:eq:cd
    can be solved self-consistently to give the carbon concentration around the core, as a function
    of nominal carbon concentration and temperature. The nominal carbon concentration was taken to
    be the maximum solubility of ferrite in the DER region, 0.02 wt% $\approx 433$ appm
    cite:hashemi11_stren_hardn_statis_correl_api_x65_steel. Calculations of 10 and 1000 appm were
    also performed. The dislocation density was varied between $1\times10^{12}$, $1\times10^{14}$ and $5\times10^{15}$, to
    see the effects of low densities up to the upper bound of dislocation densities $\sim5\times10^{15}$
    found in Fe-0.61wt%C martensite cite:morito03_disloc_densit_within_lath_marten.
  

** Progression to Line Tension Model 

   From the atomistic calculations of the Peierls potential and carbon-dislocation binding energies, one can make a
   line tension model of a dislocation from which we can obtain the kink-pair formation energies as
   a function of stress and carbon content.  This model views the dislocation as an elastic string
   which moves on the Peierls potential $\Delta E_{\text{P}}$.

   The dislocation is modelled as a discretised line, with layer labels $j$. The energy of the
   dislocation line is given by:

   \[ E_{\text{LT}} = \frac{K}{2} \sum_j (\vec{P}_j - \vec{P}_{j+1} )^2  + \sum_j \Delta E_{\text{P}}  (\vec{P}_j) +
   (\sigma \cdot \vec{b}) \times \vec{l} \cdot \vec{P}_j  - \sum_{j,k} E_{\text{C}} (|\vec{P}_j-\vec{P}_k^{}^{\text{C}}|), \]
   
   where $K$ is a constant calculated from the model, $\Delta E_{\text{P}}$ is the Peierls potential, $\sigma$ is
   the stress applied and $\vec{b}$ is the burger's vector, with the dislocation line sense given by
   $\vec{l}$. $\vec{P_{j}}$ corresponds to the dislocation core position in a given
   layer. $E_{\text{C}} (|\vec{P}_j-\vec{P}_k^{}^{\text{C}}|)$ is the binding energy of a particular carbon
   $k$, at position $\vec{P}_k^{\text{C}}$, to a dislocation core positioned at $\vec{P}_j$. The kink-pair
   formation enthalpies can then be found using the NEB/String method, to find the height of the transition-state
   barrier.

The relative energies between the different core positions is smaller in tight-binding compared to DFT.

	Comparison of 2d Peierls potentials of the $1/2\langle 111 \rangle$ screw dislocation
	between DFT and tight-binding can be found in figure ref:fig:peierlspot, with data found in
	table ref:tab:peierlspot. The sampled energies were interpolated using 2d cubic splines. The
	relative energies between the different core positions was found to be smaller in
	tight-binding compared to DFT. This is an artifact of the model, which has been reproduced
	in NEB calculations of the $1/2\langle 111\rangle$ screw dislocation Peierls barrier: the
	tight-binding Peierls barrier is approximately half that of DFT cite:Simpson2019. The split
	core energy is lower than that of the hard core, which is reminiscent of EAM potentials
	cite:Itakura2012. Some of this discrepancy can be attributed to the to erroneous interaction
	term included by Itakura, as detailed above---interaction energies can become arbitrarily
	high, if not made independent of truncation limit---but likely there are effects in DFT
	which are not encapsulated fully within the tight-binding description, such as a lack of
	core electron repulsion upon deformation of the lattice, which would increase the relative
	energy difference. Consequences of this discrepancy on future kMC simulations are discussed
	in section ref:sec:discussion.

	#+CAPTION: Peierls potential along the hard-split line. One can see in $s\text{-}d$ tight-binding model is similar to the EAM potential of Mendelev \cite{Mendelev2003}: it decreases constantly from the hard core to the split core, which will result in a kink shape which goes through the split core position. In DFT one finds a saddle point between the hard core and the midpoint, in which a kink in the transitional state will go through. [[label:hardsplittransition]]
	[[file:Images/hard-split_transition_w_canonical.png]]



  The expected transitional kink shape from this Peierls potential may differ compared to DFT, with
  dislocation core positions possibly being situated closer to/at the split core position, similar
  to EAM potentials cite:Itakura2012. Following the Peierls potential along the H-S direction,
  figure ref:hardsplittransition, we see that the Itakura potential has a saddle point, whereas in
  $s\text{-}d$ tight-binding there is not: the Peierls potential decreases monotonically
  from the hard core to the split core position. However, calculation of the Peierls barrier between
  two easy core positions in the canonical $d\text{-band}$ version of this tight-binding model
  (where $s\text{-}d$ hybridisation and non-orthogonality are simply turned off) found core
  positions of the transitional kink state to go through the metastable point, similar to DFT
  cite:Simpson2019. Furthermore, the canonical $d\text{-band}$ model produces structural energy
  differences and elastic constants which are closer to values in literature than the $s\text{-}d$ model
  cite:Paxton2010; as such, it could provide a better description of Fe-Fe interactions, and the
  Peierls potential, by extension. To verify this, recalculation of the Peierls potential using the
  canonical model will need to be undertaken.


  The Peierls potential with the $d\text{-band}$ model was found to be more reminiscent of
  DFT (with these specific contour bounds); but the difference is small: the
  maximum difference between the $d$/$s\text{-}d$ models is ~10 meV, with an average
  difference of ~+3 meV to the former.

  Along the hard-split line, instead of monotonically decreasing, like the
  $s\text{-}d$ model, there is an increase in energy from the hard core up until
  close to the midpoint, at which is decreases to the split core
  energy. Previous calculations of the Peierls barrier of the $d{\text{-band}}$
  found that the peak of the Peierls barrier was close to the midpoint, as in
  DFT, see figure ref:easyeasytransition.

  #+ATTR_LATEX:  :width \textwidth :center
  #+CAPTION: Comparison of the Peierls potentials (left) produced from $d\text{-band}$ tight-binding, DFT and EAM along each of their respective the minimum energy pathways (right), which are the reaction coordinates for the figure on the right. The EAM potential of Mendelev \cite{Mendelev2003} has an unphysical well in the centre of the potential, while tight-binding and DFT produce single-humped potentials. Tight-binding follows a pathway much closer to that of DFT. EAM potentials predict that the dislocation core goes to the split core and then back to the easy core. Even though the Peierls landscape found in tight binding has similar characteristics to the EAM in terms of the energetic ordering of different core states, the description of the minimum energy pathway of the $1/2\langle 111 \rangle$ screw dislocation as it moves between core positions is in good agreement with DFT.

#  [[file:Images/easy-easy_transition_pathway_combined_dft_dTB_eam.png]]



  In the EAM model, the midpoint along the hard-split transition is not a saddle
  point. The MEP for kink-pair formation deviates widely from the DFT path. 
   
  # To verify this, a recalculation of the
  # Peierls potential using the canonical d-band model is necessary. Further line-tension/NEB
  # calculations are necessary to verify the dislocation line shape and discrepancies in the kink-pair
  # formation enthalpy.


 #  The lowering of Peierls potential as the dislocation centre approaches the split core from the
 #  hard core can be explained by observing the end cases. In a hard core position, the dislocation
 #  centre is at the centroid of a triangle of atoms. Each of these atoms are heavily displaced,
 #  as they are well within the core region. The distance from the hard core to each
 #  atom is $a_{\text{bcc}}\sqrt{2}/3$. For the split core, the largest displacement atom at the split core position: all atoms neighbouring the split core position are at their maximum
 #  distance from the centre, $\sqrt{2/3}a_{\text{bcc}}$, $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.73$ times further. Whereas, in the hard core position, this
 #  higher energy is relaxed due to 

 #  Even though the inclusion of $s$ orbitals in the tight-binding model contributes a
 #  positive pressure cite:paxton96_atomic_struc_metal_inter,Paxton2013, and non-orthogonality
 #  effectively screens bond integral interactions---further reducing cohesion---it seems even these additions
 #  are not enough to introduce a metastable point into the Peierls potential $s\text{-}d$ hybridisation

 # in the tight-binding model reduces
 #  the repulsive interaction between the iron atoms: $s$ orbitals in Fe-Fe interactions result in an
 #  increase in the cohesive energy, which can be . This can be seen by the favouring of the split core
 #  in our calculations, where the pair potential---which was fitted at the same time as the canonical
 #  d-band model---cannot accomodate for the extra attraction of the $s$ orbitals, resulting in an
 #  insufficient in energy increase upon large deformation of the lattice, /e.g./ in the core region
 #  of a dislocation. In the canonical d-band model, there is sufficient repulsion to recover the
 #  saddle point in the Peierls potential between the cores. 


	# Some of this discrepancy can be attributed to the
	# difference in simulation method: the cluster method may inhibit the relaxation of the core
	# more than quadrupolar cells, due to finite size effects.

** Preliminary calculations

   
   To validate the cluster simulation method, the excess energy, defined as the difference in energy
   between a cell with a dislocation, and a perfect reference cell, was plotted as as function of
   $\text{ln}(R/r_c)$, where $R = R_2$ of the cluster and $r_c = b$, as seen in
   figure ref:lnrdep. In isotropic elasticity theory, this should give a linear dependence where the gradient
   corresponds to $\mu b^2 / 4\pi$, with the $y$ intercept corresponding to the
   core energy $E_{\text{core}}$. This is well reproduced by our model, except at low $\text{ln}(R/r_c)$
   as expected, where the cell size is not large enough to accommodate for sufficient relaxation of
   the dislocation core, increasing the core energy, which is not accounted for in elasticity theory.
   
   
   #+CAPTION: Excess energy of dislocation clusters with differing radii for both the easy and hard core configurations. The prediction from elasticity theory is given by the black, dashed line. Deviation of both cores occur when cell size is small, creating an increase in the core energy, which elasticity theory cannot account for. [[label:lnrdep]]
   [[file:~/Documents/docs/Management/Images/img_fe_size_dependence_on_log_of_core_radius.png]]
   



   The energy cost to transform from the easy to the hard core can be estimated by
   the difference in excess energies between the cores in the limit of
   $\text{ln}(\frac{R}{R_0}) \rightarrow 0$. At the smallest measured value, one finds that the core energy
   difference $\Delta E_{\text{core}}^{\text{Easy-Hard}} = 76$ meV/b, which is in good agreement with the DFT
   value of 82 meV/b cite:Itakura2012.


   For a line tension model of a dislocation, it is necessary to
   ascertain the energy, denoted $E_{\text{L}} = E_{\text{el}} + E_{\text{core}}$ as in Proville
   cite:Rodney2009. This can be obtained by subtracting the total
   energies of relaxed dislocation configurations to obtain the core
   energy.

** Fe-C binding energies

   

   As found in DFT simulations by Ventelon cite:Ventelon2015, when a carbon was placed in the
   vicinity of a relaxed easy dislocation core---in either of the two nearest, distinguishable,
   octahedral sites---a spontaneous reconstruction of the dislocation core occurred: from easy to
   hard. Upon reconstruction, the dislocation core moved to a neighbouring triangle, when looking
   along the $\langle 111\rangle$ direction, where the carbon found itself situated in the centre. This will be
   called a prismatic site, as in Ventelon's paper. This confirms that both hard and easy
   dislocation cores must be studied to fully understand screw dislocation behaviour in bcc iron.


   The binding energies of carbon to both the hard and easy cores can be seen in table
   ref:tab:bindingenergies, with the resulting distribution of carbon in figures
   ref:easybindingenergydist and ref:hardbindingenergydist. The distribution of carbon strongly
   depends on the type of core it finds itself situated near. The easy core only significantly
   modifies the position of the iE1 site, to the E1 site, situated in the centre of an adjacent
   triangle. All other sites are unaffected, so there is a one-to-one correspondence between all
   $\text{iE}j$ and $\text{E}j$ sites, where $j \in \{2\dots10\}$. There are carbon basins available close
   to the triangular region containing the core, but not inside.

   Carbon favours a prismatic site within the hard core (H1), which has the highest
   binding energy, 1.29 eV, of all sites considered. There are no binding sites apparent in a triangular
   annulus (of width $a_{\text{bcc}}\sqrt{2}/2$) surrounding the hard core triangle due to the
   destruction/volume reduction of octahedral sites near the hard core. The initial octahedral
   sites, iH1 and iH2 decay to the H1 site. Similarly, iH3 and iH4 decay to the H2 site, with iH9
   and iH10 decaying to a H7 site. Relations between each of the sites is given in table
   ref:decayrelations.

   
   #+CAPTION: Decay relations between the initial and final sites upon relaxation of carbon intersitials around the hard core. [[label:decayrelations]]
   | Initial   | Final |
   |-----------+-------|
   | iH1, iH2  | H1    |
   | iH3, iH4  | H2    |

   Note that interactions between carbon atoms around the core are not taken into account here:
   figures ref:easybindingenergydist and ref:hardbindingenergydist are purely diagrammatic and not
   what one expects the true distribution of carbon around a screw dislocation would be. Carbon is strongly
   repulsive at first nearest-neighbour distances, which would modify each of these
   distributions.

    similarly conducted DFT and EAM calculations for the interaction energy 12\AA from the core, and
    their calculations agreed with the continuum limit of Eshelby theory with a binding energy of
    0.2 eV. In DFT calculations by Ventelon cite:Ventelon2015, the interaction energy of a carbon in a
    hard core prism configuration was found to be 0.79 eV for a thickness in the $Z$ direction of
    3$b$ (0.73eV for $6b$)---in the convention that a positive binding energy indicates
    attraction. This is significantly lower than the 1.29eV interaction energy of tight-binding.
    This discrepancy can be partially explained by the fact that the cells have not been allowed to
    relax with all degrees of freedom, as in the Ventelon results: the three atoms around the screw
    core are fixed in $Z$ to so the dislocation core position does not change upon
    relaxation. 

    Repeating the calculation for the binding of a H1 carbon to a screw
    dislocation using a quadrupolar array, allowing for all atoms to relax, gives a
    binding energy of 0.88 eV. This agrees very well with the DFT results of Ventelon
    cite:Ventelon2015.

    A source of error for this discrepancy is likely from the fitting of the tight-binding model
    itself. The Peierls barrier of this $s\text{-}d$ model of iron, necessary for Fe-C
    interactions, has been shown to be half that found in DFT cite:Simpson2019, but the
    solution energies for Fe-C defect complexes are well described. This implies there is
    insufficient repulsion between Fe-Fe species upon deformation, leading to a larger
    resultant Fe-C binding energy from tight-binding.




** Analysis of carbon concentration along dislocation
   
   Variation of carbon concentration along the dislocation line for each of the binding sites can be
   seen in figure ref:cdhardeasy. Due to the lower overall binding energies of carbon to the easy
   core, the concentration of weakly bound sites occurred at a lower temperature. Dislocation
   densities near the upper bound of what has been observed in martensite, $\rho \approx10^{15}$, reduce
   the temperature at which carbon concentration decreases around the dislocation core. Lower
   nominal carbon concentrations cause carbon concentrations around the dislocation to decrease at a
   lower temperature.

   In the operating temperature range of $40-90\deg\text{C} = 310-360\deg\text{K}$, we expect most hard
   core sites are saturated. Given the high concentrations of the E1/E2 sites around the easy core
   in this range, we expect all dislocations will be of the hard core type, due to reconstruction of
   the easy core by the adjacent carbon.

** Progression to Line Tension Model 


   The $K$ coefficient for the line tension model was calculated from atomistic simulations, using
   the method of Itakura cite:Itakura2012, by calculation of a Hessian from the displacement of
   atoms surrounding the dislocation core. Tight-binding gave $K = 0.734$ eV\AA$^{-2}$, which agrees well
   with DFT, where $K = 0.816$ eV\AA$^{-2}$.

    
    # This discrepancy can be
    # partially explained due to the short cutoff of the carbon interactions in tight-binding---at
    # $\sim a_{\text{bcc}} = 2.87 \AA$.

    [[file:~/Documents/docs/Management/Images/fe_c_binding_energy_distance.png]]
    
   Dislocation-carbon binding energies were found to decay with distance, as seen in figures
   ref:distancedep and ref:lorentzianfit. A Lorentzian was fit to specific binding energies such
   that a continuous function could be used to describe binding within
   the line tension model. This is a purely empirical model. The
   choice of sites used for the fitting is discussed in section ref:sec:discussion.

The sites chosen to fit to were determined by those sites a prismatic carbon in a hard core configuration would find itself, if the dislocation were to move without it along the $X = \langle\bar{2}11\rangle$ direction. [[label:lorentzianfit]]
   [[file:~/Documents/docs/Management/Images/fe-c_lorentzian_fit_binding_energies2.png]]
   
#    To choose the sites to fit the Lorentzian too, 
#    Upon movement of a screw dislocation saturated with carbon, for example, the expected hard core
#    ground state configuration (with H$x$ sites filled) to an adjacent easy core position, it is
#    expected that carbon will not diffuse away in the time it takes for the dislocation to move position,
#    due to the large dislocation velocity compared to the speed of diffusivity in carbon. So sites
#    occupied by carbon will remain in the same position relative to the lattice as the dislocation
#    changes to the easy core.  This results in a new dislocation-carbon configuration. If the carbon
#    is near one of the positions of the E$x$ sites, it will decay to that position, resulting in a
#    new carbon-dislocation binding energy, which is now of easy core type. One can linearly
#    interpolate between these binding energies, depending dislocation core position.


# To take more of the
#    atomistic data into account in the line tension model, we propose
#    another method to be used in further work.


   # The NEB and String algorithms implemented by by Makri cite:Makri2019, will be used to validate the line
   # tension model implementation on the data from Itakura, using both their Peierls potential
   # and hydrogen-dislocation binding energy fit.


   
   # - Show line tension work maybe?
   # - Inconclusive right now as more work needs to be done. 
   # - Explain the interpolation between the easy and hard cores, for where it is possible, otherwise,

* Discussion
  \label{sec:discussion}

  # - How do the results of this work feed into C migration with
  #   dislocations? 
  # - How valid is the theory we have vs Fu /et al/.
  # - Novel work to find out dislocation environment around both dislocation cores.

  
  # We expect the transitional kink-shape to be similar to DFT in this model, as the Peierls
  # 	potential at the metastable point between the easy cores, (point 13 in table
  # 	ref:tab:peierlspot and figure ref:sampledpositions, right), is lower in energy than the
  # 	split core position (point 9 in the aforementioned figures) as found in the Itakura data set
  # 	cite:Itakura2012. This was seen in the canonical $d\text{-band}$ version of this
  # 	tight-binding model (where $s\text{-}d$ hybridisation is simply turned off)
  # 	cite:Simpson2019. Line-tension/NEB calculations are necessary to verify this.


	We expect a reduction in the kink-pair formation enthalpy in tight-binding, due to
	the slightly smaller overall Peierls potential along the expected minimum enthalpy
	path of the kink within the line tension model. This would increase
	the rate of kink nucleation in kMC models, causing a higher overall dislocation
	velocity. This will increase the disparity between the dislocation velocity and
	the speed of carbon diffusion. In the vicinity of the dislocation line, there is a
	"high-mobility" zone for carbon to diffuse easily around the dislocation
	cite:Nematollahi2016. Assuming a similar kink shape as found in DFT calculations,
	we expect the kink-pair formation energy to be $\sim 0.7$ eV, which similar in
	magnitude to the DFT value ($0.73$ eV) cite:Itakura2012. Hence, we predict the
	increase in dislocation velocity would not so large as to effectively negate the
	effect of the high-mobility zone---which would result in carbon not being able to
	"catch-up" to dislocations upon movement. Therefore, we do not expect the observed
	discrepancy in the Peierls potential to significantly change the principal
	mechanisms observed, or results obtained, from kMC simulations of
	dislocation-assisted carbon migration.


	# by a factor of ${\text{exp}}(+\Delta E_{\text{kp}}^{\text{tbe-DFT}}/ k_{\text{b}} T)$

	# would not effect the influence of solutes on dislocation movement: inhibiting dislocation
	# movement in a larger range of stresses due to the larger relative magnitude of
	# carbon-dislocation binding energies to the kink nucleation energy barrier.

	# The However, measurements of the Peierls stress with the canonical $d$-band version of this
	# tight-binding model (where $$s\text{-}d$$ hybridisation is simply turned off) agree well with DFT
	# compared to other iron tight-binding models: the Peierls stress is 1.3 GPa, compared to 1.4
	# GPa cite:Simpson2019. Thus we expect a peierls potential which is more reminiscent of the
	# DFT version in the canonical $d$-band tight-binding model. As such, a recalculation of the
	# peierls potential using the canonical $d$-band model may be fruitful. It is not certain how
	# these effects will manifest in the prediction of how and where carbon migrates with
	# dislocations.



	# this difference in core configuration would, in principle, give
	# another set of carbon-dislocation binding energies and carbon distributions to account for
	# at that position, with also a different distribution of carbon sites around the core, but as
	# these are positions on the side of the kink, we can neglect these details in the
	# line-tension/kMC model as these dislocation segments are short. Even accounting for the
	# increase in expected kink width, which will be slightly larger than DFT, as the kink width
	# $w \propto b\sqrt{ K / \Delta E_{\text{P}}}$. However, with the 



	# We expect the $$s\text{-}d$$
	# model kink width is to be larger than DFT due to the lower overall Peierls potential, as the
	# kink width $w \propto b\sqrt{ K / \Delta E_{\text{P}}}$.

    As in L√ºthi cite:Lthi2019, carbon interactions were found to be vital in understanding how screw
    dislocations move in steels, due to the spontaneous reconstruction of the pure iron ground state
    (easy core) upon introduction of carbon. From the large binding energy of the H1 site, one would
    expect a hard core with carbon in a prismatic site as the ground state configuration for pinned
    dislocations.

    In the context of dislocation-assisted carbon migration, with sufficient contact stress,
    dislocations in their hard core ground state will be forced to move (say, along the $X =
    \langle\bar{2}11\rangle$ direction), which results in the hard core reconstructing to an easy core. Due to
    the much higher velocity of dislocations, relative to the diffusivity of carbon, the
    prismatic carbon will stay in-place, becoming an E1 site. A drag force now acts to impede motion of the
    dislocation, due to the binding of the carbon in the E1 site. Progression of dislocation glide
    results in further reconstruction of the dislocation core to hard and easy states, with the
    original carbon being situated in H2, E6 and H3 sites, relative to the dislocation
    centre. Thus as the dislocation moves, there is a significant drag force acting on the
    dislocation, which decreases the further the dislocation moves from carbon, as one would
    expect. This suggests that a dislocation-assisted carbon migration mechanism could be feasible,
    but the last two stages of the multi-scale model are necessary to verify this.


    In normal operating temperatures of the bearing, one expects all dislocations to be hard cores
    saturated with carbon (neglecting C-C interaction) in most of the $\text{H}j$ sites, as seen in
    the concentration analysis. In ferrite that has just transformed, assuming a C concentration of
    0.6 wt% as seen in martensite, we expect similar behaviour to the 1000 appm case as seen in
    figure ref:cdhardeasy. Including C-C interactions would reduce these concentrations from
    saturation. There is insufficient data to say how strong this effect would be.


    # In the ranges of normal bearing operating temperatures ($40\deg\text{C} - 70\deg\text{C}$). The carbon
    # concentration of weakly bound sites starts to decrease.  
    


    # This forms the basis of the line tension model of the dislocation. We have a more sophisticated
    # method of being able to incorporate the binding energy of carbon to dislocations than Itakura. 

  # - Peierls potential agrees, although it is low compared to DFT
  # - Line tension model has been set up, although results have not been achieved yet.
  # - kMC depends on the results of the line tension model. 

  # The first stage in this work is 
    

  
* Future work  

  # - Validation of line-tension model by reproduction of the dislocation line shape from
  #   Itakura 2012 cite:Itakura2012.
  # - Compare tbe dislocation line shape with Itakura, and find the migration path of the dislocation from tbe data.
  # - [Optional] Create Ising model for easy and hard core an compare the binding energies like cite:Lthi2019. 
  # - [Optional] Find the elastic dipole tensor to check the binding energy of C within anisotropic elasticity.
  # - Choose the sites for which one can fit a function (Lorentzian) for the interaction energy between C and Fe.
  # - Find the kink-pair formation enthalpy, with and without carbon, to feed into the kMC
  #   code. 

  The prerequisites for a line tension model are in place for determination of the kink-pair
  formation enthalpies of screw dislocations as a function of carbon content and stress. This is
  ongoing work. Validation tests will be carried out on the Itakura data set for the binding of
  hydrogen to screw dislocations in bcc iron.

  # The Peierls potential will be recalculated using the canonical $d\text{-band}$ model, in hopes to
  # rectify the discrepancy in the Peierls potential found in DFT.

  # This data set will also be used to verify the new interpolated
  # solute-dislocation interaction energy, between the hard and easy core configurations.


  Using the kink-pair formation enthalpies and the binding energies of carbon to screw dislocations, one can proceed
  with kinetic Monte Carlo simulation of dislocation glide, in an environment of carbon to
  understand how dislocations move carbon under applied stress, in different temperature
  and nominal carbon concentration regimes.


  It would be of interest to pursue atomistic calculations of carbon bound to edge
  dislocations. Recent DFT/Eshelby theory calculations by Maugis /et al./ cite:Maugis2020, show
  under /compressive/ stress, carbon diffusivity is /enhanced/. Pipe diffusion along edge
  dislocations could therefore be an important aspect to consider in carbon transport, in addition
  to the higher mobility of edge dislocations in bcc iron. As such, edge dislocations could be quite
  important within the mechanism of dislocation-assisted carbon migration.
  
  Ising and Monte Carlo models of intersite carbon interactions have been performed using the
  results of DFT carbon-dislocation binding energies cite:Lthi2019.  These calculations only
  considered the hard core, with carbon binding sites of the H1 prismatic site and a H2 site, (which
  they name $P$ and $O^{(4)}$ respectively). First neighbour C-C interactions were taken
  into account, both along the dislocation line and between carbon sites. Using the tight-binding
  calculations detailed in this report, we can easily apply and extend this analysis to consider more
  binding sites around the hard core, and observe stable carbon distributions around the easy core.

  Analysis of carbon diffusion barriers around a dislocation are necessary. In a DFT/EAM
  study of carbon-supersaturated ferrite in pearlitic wires, it was found that carbon can diffuse
  easily around the dislocation, which is an important consideration in the drag mechanism proposed
  cite:Nematollahi2016.

* Conclusion 
  
  Dislocation-assisted carbon migration is thought to be a viable mechanism by which martensite
  decays to form DER regions---mostly composed of ferrite interspersed in a martensitic
  matrix---which enhances failure risk by RCF. There is dispute over where excess carbon from the
  martensitic matrix finds itself upon transformation to ferrite, of much lower carbon
  solubility. The current leading mechanism suggests carbon segregates to pre-existing carbides, yet
  experimental results show in the late stages of DER formation, pre-existing carbides are partially
  dissolved in areas of highly localized plasticity, implying segregation of carbon to
  dislocations. As such, a thorough investigation of carbon-dislocation interactions is vital to
  understanding how DER initially forms and progresses.

  Atomistic calculations using tight-binding, the first stage in a multi-scale paradigm to
  understand dislocation-assisted carbon migration, found a Peierls potential with characteristics
  comparable to both EAM/DFT results. A canonical $d\text{-band}$ model may better describe this
  energy landscape. It is not expected that the discrepancy in the Peierls potential would
  significantly change results in kMC simulations.

  Carbon distribution around the easy and hard cores were found to differ
  significantly, with the largest binding energy being found by carbon being situated in a prismatic
  site in the hard core. Carbon within 3\AA of the easy core caused reconstruction to the hard core,
  with carbon in a prismatic site.

  Equilibrium concentrations of carbon around the hard/easy cores at normal operating temperatures
  suggest that all dislocations are of hard core type with carbon situated in a H1/prismatic site, with
  reconstruction of all easy core dislocations to hard core, resulting in all dislocations being
  pinned.

  If a dislocation moves under stress from the hard core-prismatic carbon ground state, a large drag
  force acts on the dislocation upon movement to adjacent easy and hard positions, assuming the carbon
  will stay in place due to its low diffusion coefficient, relative to dislocation velocity. The
  carbon-dislocation binding energies decrease with distance, and are in good agreement with
  literature. This suggests that a dislocation-assisted carbon migration mechanism is plausible, but
  more work needs to be done to confirm if so.

  Further work will be done to ascertain diffusion barriers around the dislocation, which have been
  shown to be significantly reduced from bulk values due to the presence of dislocations in DFT/EAM
  calculations cite:Nematollahi2016. This will complete the description of the solute drag mechanism.
  
  Line tension and kMC models will be used to determine how dislocation glide is affected by carbon
  and how carbon can move with dislocations.

   \[ E_z = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{h}{2\pi} \sqrt{ k_i /
   m_{\text{C}} },  \]
   where $k_i$ are the eigenvalues of the Hessian and $m_\text{C}$ is
   the mass of carbon.
