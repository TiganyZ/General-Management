@article{Clouet2012,
abstract = {Plasticity in zirconium is controlled by 1/3{\textless}1-210{\textgreater} screw dislocations gliding in the prism planes of the hexagonal close-packed structure. This prismatic and not basal glide is observed for a given set of transition metals like zirconium and is known to be related to the number of valence electrons in the d band. We use ab initio calculations based on the density functional theory to study the core structure of screw dislocations in zirconium. Dislocations are found to dissociate in the prism plane in two partial dislocations, each with a pure screw character. Ab initio calculations also show that the dissociation in the basal plane is unstable. We calculate then the Peierls barrier for a screw dislocation gliding in the prism plane and obtain a small barrier. The Peierls stress deduced from this barrier is lower than 21 MPa, which is in agreement with experimental data. The ability of an empirical potential relying on the embedded atom method (EAM) to model dislocations in zirconium is also tested against these ab initio calculations.},

  abstract = {Substantial microstructural changes have been found to occur in bearing steels when subjected to high stress Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) and have been mainly reported in literature between the 1940s and 1990s. However, owing to limitations in the characterisation techniques available at the time, inconsistent interpretation and use of discrepant terminology have caused considerable difficulties in defining the microstructural changes accurately and unambiguously. In the present work, we have investigated the typical microstructural alterations, including Dark Etching Region (DER), Low Angle Bands (LABs) and High Angle Bands (HABs), and their formation mechanisms in RCF failed AISI 52100 (100Cr6) bearing steels using a combination of advanced microstructure characterisation techniques, including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and nanohardness measurements. Based on this combined approach, we are now able to give detailed insight in the plasticity-induced transformation and degradation mechanisms during high-stress RCF. The results show that new globular and elongated grains with distinct textures form during all stages of RCF, however a redistribution of chemical elements was only observed during the later stages of RCF. This has provided a significant insight in the formation mechanisms of DER, LABs and HABs. A model of the sequence of microstructure alterations during RCF is thus been proposed based on the findings.},

  abstract = {Surface segregation in alloys, i.e., concentration modulation in the surface selvedge at thermodynamical equilibrium, can be viewed as resulting from two kinds of competition or synergy. The ®rst one is between surface and bulk interactions, i.e., surface energy versus bulk alloying interactions, whereas the second one is between these chemical forces and the atomic size-mismatch. Modelling the phenomenon then requires to account for all these forces on the same level. This leads to use both realistic energetic models derived from electronic structure and ecient statistical tools, from mean±®eld approximation to Monte Carlo simulations. A particular attention must be payed to the possible multisolution character of the problem. Actually, the possible coexistence of stable and metastable solutions may be at the origin of super®cial phase transitions, in which the surface acts as a precursor of bulk order±disorder transitions: layering transitions, concentration pro®le transitions, surface induced order or disorder. All these phenomena are illustrated here on some speci®c systems and analyzed with tools derived from tight-binding formalism. Finally, the strong coupling between surface segregation and atomic reconstructions is illustrated in the case of strong size-mismatch by means of molecular dynamics calculations.

Straight screw dislocations glide slowly in \{1 1 0\} elemental slip planes, at a velocity proportional to their length, whereas curved non-screw parts are highly mobile. The exact loop shape can yield the local stress as well as the difference of core energy between pure screw and near-screw orientations. The velocity–stress dependence of screws has been measured at the scale of a single dislocation source, and compared with macroscopic activation areas. The results are discussed in terms of the kink-pair mechanism.},

  abstract = {The equilibrium segregation of carbon atoms in the core of screw dislocations in body-centred cubic Fe is modelled using a generalized Ising model parametrized on density functional theory calculations and solved using both mean-field calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. Recently, a strong carbon-dislocation attraction was evidenced, resulting in a spontaneous reconstruction of the dislocation core towards a hard core configuration, where the carbon atom is located at the centre of a regular trigonal prism called a prismatic site. Here we show that the fourth neighbour octahedral sites of the reconstructed core are also attractive for carbon with a binding energy similar to that of the prismatic core site reported previously. This suggests that the dislocation may be decorated by lines of carbon atoms on both types of sites. Moreover, all carbon–carbon interactions including intra-line and inter-line interactions, are found repulsive. Segregation therefore results from a competition between the dislocation-carbon attraction and the carbon–carbon repulsion, leading to complex ordering phenomena that are analysed here in detail. Notably, we evidence a high temperature regime, in the regime of dynamical strain ageing of steels, where the prismatic line is half-occupied on average with every other prismatic site occupied by a carbon atom while the octahedral lines are empty. The iso-concentrations for the prismatic and octahedral lines obtained with the mean-field approach and with Monte Carlo simulations are qualitatively similar.},

Given an embedded atom (EAM) potential as input, energy barriers for diffusion are ascertained on the fly from the local environments of H atoms. To reduce computational cost, on-the-fly calculations are supplemented with precomputed strain-dependent energy barriers in defect-free parts of the crystal. These precomputed barriers, obtained with high-accuracy density functional theory calculations, are used to ascertain the veracity of the EAM barriers and correct them when necessary. Examples of bulk diffusion in crystals containing a screw dipole and vacancies are presented. Effective diffusivities obtained from KMC simulations are found to be in good agreement with theory. Our model provides an avenue for simulating the interaction of hydrogen with cracks, dislocations, grain boundaries, and other lattice defects, over extended time scales, albeit at atomistic length scales.},

We obtained a maximum concentration of 10 ± 1 at.\% C at T = 0 K within a radius of 1 nm from the dislocation lines. The spatial carbon distributions around the line defects revealed that the Cottrell atmosphere associated with an edge dislocation is denser than that around a screw dislocation, in contrast with the predictions of the classical model of Cochardt and colleagues. Moreover, the present Cottrell atmosphere model is in reasonable quantitative accord with the three-dimensional atom probe data available in the literature.},

Our method couples a purpose-made machine-learned H-Fe potential, which enables rapid sampling with near-density-functional-theory accuracy, with a statistical mechanical calculation of the trap occupancy using the technique of nested sampling. In contrast to the conventional assumption (based on Oriani theory) that at industrially relevant hydrogen concentrations and ambient conditions vacancy traps are are fully occupied, we find that vacancy traps are less than fully occupied under these conditions, necessitating a reevaluation of how we think about “mobile hydrogen” in iron and steel.},

In its simplest form, the FK model describes the motion of a chain of interacting particles (“atoms”) subjected to an external on-site periodic potential. Physically important generalizations of the FK model are discussed including nonsinusoidal on-site potentials and anharmonic (e.g., nonconvex, Kac–Baker, power-law) interactions between the particles. The results are summarized for the one-dimensional dynamics of kinks – topological excitations, including the kink diffusion and effects of disorder, and also for nonlinear localized modes, discrete breathers.

Repeating this calculation with a high-speed computer, the forming process of a solute atmosphere round a moving dislocation and the stress effected on the dislocation by this atmosphere were obtained. This method is for a non-steady state, from which, if required, a steady state can be obtained as the limiting case.},

  abstract = {A theory of yielding and strain ageing of iron, based on the segregation of carbon atoms to form atmospheres round dislocations, is developed. The form of an atmosphere is discussed and the force needed to release a dislocation from its atmosphere is roughly estimated and found to be reasonable. The dependence on temperature of the yield point is explained on the assumption that thermal fluctuations enable small dislocation loops to break away; these loops subsequently extend and cause yielding to develop catastrophically by helping other dislocations to break away. The predicted form of the relation between yield point and temperature agrees closely with experiment. Strain ageing is interpreted as the migration of carbon atoms to free dislocations. The rate of ageing depends upon the concentration of carbon in solution and the estimated initial rate agrees with experiment on the assumption that about 0.003\% by weight of carbon is present in solution.},

  abstract = {A hallmark of low-temperature plasticity in body-centered cubic (BCC) metals is its departure from Schmid’s law. One aspect is that non-glide stresses, which do not produce any driving force on the dislocations, may affect the yield stress. We show here that this effect is due to a variation of the relaxation volume of the \$\$1/2\textbackslash langle 111\textbackslash rangle\$\$ screw dislocations during glide. We predict quantitatively non-glide effects by modeling the dislocation core as an Eshelby inclusion, which couples elastically to the applied stress. This model explains the physical origin of the generalized yield criterion classically used to include non-Schmid effects in constitutive models of BCC plasticity. We use first-principles calculations to properly account for dislocation cores and use tungsten as a reference BCC metal. However, the methodology developed here applies to other BCC metals, other energy models and other solids showing non-glide effects.},

  abstract = {Recent studies show that the effect of the lattice vibrations on predictions of phase stability can be important. Because complete computations of the phonon density of states from first principles are difficult, simpler models for the vibrational free energy have been used to incorporate these effects into phase diagram calculations. In this paper, we systematically investigate the accuracy of these approximations by studying model systems for which the vibrational free energy can be computed exactly in the harmonic approximation. We found that the Debye approximation, usually used in first-principles studies, fails to capture the configuration dependence of the vibrational free energy. We explain the reason for this failure. With the same model systems, we analyzed the effect of the lattice vibrations on the predicted phase diagrams as a function of size mismatch and chemical affinity. By fitting our results to the available experimental information, we find that the effect of vibrations on phase transition temperatures may be significant.},
